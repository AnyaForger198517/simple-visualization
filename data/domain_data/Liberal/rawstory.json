        "articles": "Welcome to another edition of What Fresh Hell?, Raw Story’s roundup of news items that might have become controversies under another regime, but got buried – or at least were under-appreciated – due to the daily firehose of political pratfalls, unhinged tweet storms and other embarrassments coming out of the current White House. 1. a government or state in which those in power exploit national resources and steal; rule by a thief or thieves. The Original Sin that led to all of the grift and corruption we’re seeing from this regime occurred when the media and political establishments allowed Trump to run for the presidency without releasing his tax returns and take office without divesting his business interests. Of course they were busy obsessing over Hillary Clinton’s emails. But not only did that signal to Trump and his minions that they could get away with just about anything, it also resulted in a degree of opacity that only law enforcement can penetrate. Soon after Trump was elected, The Wall Street Journal summed up this problem with a story about the labyrinthian web of front-companies that connected Trump to just one of his more modest assets... To be more precise, he has a revocable trust that owns 99% of a Delaware limited liability company that owns 99% of another Delaware LLC that owns a Scottish limited company that owns another Scottish company that owns the 26-year-old Sikorsky S-76B helicopter, emblazoned with a red “TRUMP” on the side of its fuselage. We don’t really know the angles Trump’s played to enrich himself and his loyalists using the power of the White House, and depending on the outcomes of various investigations, we may never know. But we have gotten some insights into the Trump money machine, thanks to some good reporting and, in some cases, from court filings. And one consistent theme has been huge slush funds of various types paying out giant sums to people in Trump’s inner circle, and in some cases to Trump himself. The writing was on the wall during the 2016 campaign, when the Trump Organization quintupled the rent it was charging the Trump Campaign as soon as donors started picking up the tab. And on the same day in 2016 that Trump cut a fundraising agreement with the RNC, “the campaign made payments to three Trump properties\" totaling around $200 grand. This has continued since the election. As Walter Shaub, a former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, wrote for The Washington Post this week, “we taxpayers are paying tens of millions for [Trump] to spend almost a third of his days in office visiting his properties. Some of the money goes into his pocket. We learned last fall that the Secret Service had paid him over $150,000 in golf cart rental fees for the privilege of guarding his life while he golfs. Last month, Public Citizen issued a report finding that Trump’s businesses had billed $15.1 million to campaign, political committee and federal government sources since he first launched his presidential campaign.” The Republican National Committee has been paying almost $38,000 per month to rent a “basically empty” office space from Trump for his own 2020 campaign since late last year. The campaign itself paid the Trump Organization almost a half-million in inflated rent before the RNC took over the payments. According to The HuffPo, “in all, the Trump campaign spent $774,163 in donor money at Trump-branded businesses last year.” We still don’t really know where the $107 million Trump’s grifter friends raised for his inauguration went. It was a cheap affair, but they managed to spend twice as much as Obama had for his star-studded inauguration in 2008. But we did know that a longtime friend of Melania’s, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, opened up a firm a month after the election that would grab $26 million of that sum for “planning” the event. This week, we learned that Mueller’s following the money, much of which came from foreign sources. Wolkoff is by no means alone. A whole pack of grifters have been getting rich since Trump’s election. His former bodyguard, Keith Schiller, left the White House and has been raking in $15,000 per month from the RNC ever since for “security consulting.” (Schiller had already cashed in to the tune of almost $300,000 during the 2016 campaign from the Trump Organization, the Trump Campaign and the RNC.) Elliott Broidy, the GOP deputy finance chair and close Trump associate also managed to secure $200 million in new contracts from the UAE after the election, thanks to the shady middleman George Nader, who is now cooperating with Mueller. That was part of a coordinate effort to turn Broidy “into an instrument of influence at the White House for the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,” according to The New York Times. And as we mentioned last week, one of those countries’ rivals, Qatar, has pushed back against their influence by buying four increasingly-hard-to-sell Trump properties, the most recent of which was purchased just after a judge dismissed a lawsuit against Trump for violating the Emoluments Clause. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowsky has opened up or partnered with no fewer than three DC lobbying firms since the election (he denies working for a fourth). Brad Parscale, the guy Trump hired to throw together a website for $1,500 and whose firm ultimately took in $94 million from the 2016 campaign, continued to get an average of $474,000 per month from the RNC after the election. Nobody really knows what Mike Pence’s nephew, John Pence, is doing for Trump’s reelection campaign, but he’s making in the neighborhood of $120,000 per year for something, according to financial disclosures. And this goes on and on – there are actually way too many of these kinds of stories to detail here in full. And then this week, thanks to the Woodward and Bernstein of the Trump era -- a porn star and her lawyer – we learned that Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime consigliere and bagman, used the shell company that he’d set up to pay hush money to Stormy Daniels -- and to a Playboy playmate whom Trump probably knocked up before shifting the blame to Broidy -- to… solicit payments from various corporations -- including one tied to a Russian oligarch -- for “access” to Trump which, at least in some cases, he didn’t even deliver. On the very same day Donald Trump promised a 5-point plan to \"Drain the Swamp,\" including preventing lobbyists from…  — Steven Dennis (@Steven Dennis)1525984826.0 Everything in his history suggests that Trump himself has probably gotten a cut of at least some of these deals. Everything you’ve read above may be legal, but not if all this money was being shoveled around for corrupt purposes. Again, Trump’s long history of sleazy business dealings make this a pretty safe bet. Let’s pause here to recall that Robert Mueller’s team includes some of the country’s top prosecutors and investigators specializing in fraud and financial crimes, and they have had most of this information long before we even knew it existed. It’s possible that these crooks will get away with it, but if I were them, I wouldn’t bet my freedom on it. Sarah Sanders says that the Michael Cohen payments from AT&T and Novartis are an example of draining the swamp beca…  — Eamon Javers (@Eamon Javers)1526067149.0 And with that news, let’s consider some other outrages that may have been lost in the shuffle this week… ****** Remember Scott Pruitt’s luxurious $120,000 trip to Italy, very little of which was spent working? Remember the sumptuous dinner that he enjoyed at Rome’s Hotel Eden, which runs around $300 a head? This week, we discovered that Pruitt dined that evening “with Cardinal George Pell, a prominent climate-science denialist and Vatican leader who was also facing sexual abuse allegations.” The EPA intentionally left Pell’s name out of its description of the evening, according to The New York Times. “Kevin Chmielewski, Mr. Pruitt’s former deputy chief of staff for operations, said in an interview that top political appointees at the agency feared that the meeting would reflect poorly on Mr. Pruitt if it were made public. Twenty days after the dinner, authorities in Australia charged Cardinal Pell with sexual assault…” That would reflect poorly, but maybe more so for the alleged child molester than Pruitt. ****** It should probably come as no surprise that “top aides to Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency are screening public records requests related to the embattled administrator, slowing the flow of information released under the Freedom of Information Act — at times beyond what the law allows.” More on that one at Politico. ****** Will this ultimately add fuel the opioid crisis? The Labor Department plans to unwind decades-old youth labor protections by allowing teenagers to work longer hours under some of the nation’s most hazardous workplace conditions. Only time will tell. ****** Here, via the Washington Post, is a great example of a bigoted policy that’s stupid even on its own terms… It's a bit like anti-choicers favoring abstinence-only education, which leads to more unintended pregnancies and ultimately more abortions. Stop hitting yourselves, wingnuts. ****** Only the best… oh, you know... Remember the \"pink slime\" lawsuit? Trump has tapped the star witness in that case — a Texas Tech professor who test…  — Kolten Parker (@Kolten Parker)1525875118.0 ****** This story is consistent with the Trump regime’s relentless attempts to purge all information about climate change – which Marmalade Mussolini thinks is all a Chinese hoax – from the entire government. Paul Voosen writes for Science Magazine: ****** And yet another policy of ignoring real threats ****** Finally, three ugly stories about what happens when you put white nationalists in charge of your justice system… Sam Levin reported for The Guardian this week that Rakem Balogun, a father of three, “is believed to be the first person targeted and prosecuted under a secretive US surveillance effort to track so-called 'black identity extremists.'” Balogun was held without bail for five months for being a vocal activist against police brutality. The charges against him didn’t stand up, because we still have a more or less functional judicial system, but Balogun “lost his home and more while incarcerated.” ****** Meanwhile, in Houston, undocumented immigrants who are caught perpetrating low-level offenses make bail, and then are scooped up by ICE as they leave the courthouse. Seems brutal but straightforward. But according to the Texas Observer, “abysmal record-keeping and an increasingly secretive immigration force have created a catch-22” for these mostly poor workers: “as they languish in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, sometimes for months, they are asked to do the impossible: show up for their Harris County court hearings…. The penalties for missing court are serious: Bonds can be raised or revoked, and the court can issue arrest warrants or new citations in a revolving-door scenario reminiscent of a Kafka novel.” ****** Finally, The Intercept reported this week that Customs and Border Patrol appear to be targeting activists offering life-saving aid to undocumented immigrants. “Nine volunteers with No More Deaths, an official ministry of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Tucson, [have been] hit with federal charges in recent months for leaving water in a remote federal wilderness preserve where migrants routinely disappear and die,” writes Ryan Devereaux. The latest “arrest came just hours after No More Deaths published a report that documents evidence of Border Patrol agents destroying jugs of water that the group leaves for migrants in the desert.” And here’s a key point: Graft and cruelty: the twin hallmarks of the Trump regime. Make sure you register and vote this fall. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G. Newell, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:43 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced. A judge since 2016 and before that Caroline County's top prosecutor for more than a decade, he was to be taken into custody on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child, prosecutors said,\" reported Justin Fenton. \"A boy that Newell took on a hunting trip on Hoopers Island discovered a hidden camera in the bathroom on July 23, and his parents reported it to police, which The Sun reported last week.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Friday criticized President Joe Biden for ending the war in Afghanistan, which dragged on for two decades. Before taking over Strom Thurmond's seat in the U.S. Senate, Graham voted for the war in Afghanistan as a member of the House of Representatives. The United States may soon hit yet another major milestone in its efforts to vaccinate its citizens against the novel coronavirus. Reuters reports that American regulators could authorize Pfizer's vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 as soon as the end of October. ",

        "articles": "The former British spy who wrote a salacious dossier about Donald Trump also wrote a sequel document, according to a new report. \"The former MI6 spy Christopher Steele produced a second dossier for the FBI on Donald Trump while he was in the White House, sources told The Telegraph. Mr Steele filed a series of intelligence reports to US authorities during the Trump presidency, including information concerning alleged sexual exploits,\" the British newspaper reported Monday evening. \"Mr Steele's continued involvement supplying intelligence to the FBI appears to give credibility to his original dossier, which sparked a Special Counsel investigation by prosecutor Robert Mueller into Russian interference into the 2016 US presidential elections,\" the newspaper noted. \"The second dossier contains raw intelligence that makes further claims of Russian meddling in the US election and also references claims regarding the existence of further sex tapes. The second dossier is reliant on separate sources to those who supplied information for the first reports.\" \"The fact the FBI continued to receive intelligence from Mr Steele, who ran MI6's Russia desk from 2006 to 2009 before setting up Orbis, is potentially significant because it shows his work was apparently still being taken seriously after Mr Trump took hold of the reins of power,\" the newspaper explained. \"The suggestion it includes further details of Mr Trump's sexual exploits will infuriate the former president. On Twitter he has called the allegations a 'pile of garbage.'\" Read the full report. Former Vice President Mike Pence Friday made a rare TV appearance to rail against President Biden’s new push for COVID vaccine mandates as “unlike anything we’ve heard before.” In his first television interview since leaving office, Pence suggested Biden’s tougher approach on requiring COVID vaccinations amounts to violating personal freedom. The ex-veep also said it’s just not how a president is supposed to talk to the American people. “To have the president of the United States say that he’s been patient, but his patience is wearing thin, that’s not how the American people expect to be spoke... Washington Post reporter Philip Bump on Friday compared states that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020 with states that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020 and found it was \"impossible\" to separate politics from pandemic outcomes. In a chart posted on his Twitter account, Bump showed how much Biden-voting states have diverged from Trump-voting states ever since vaccines started rolling out late last year, and he found that blue states are now doing significantly better than they were a year ago at this time, while red states are doing significantly worse. MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and a group of his allies met with Donald Trump over dinner on Aug. 13 — the date Lindell had previously promised would bring Trump's \"reinstatement\" as president — sources have told Salon. The previously-unreported meeting occurred shortly after the bedding tycoon's \"cyber symposium\" in South Dakota, which failed to produce anything close to proof of election fraud. Josh Merritt, a former member of Lindell's \"red team\" at the South Dakota gathering, told Salon that the meeting occurred at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach on the evening of Aug. 13. According to Merritt, New Mexico State University law professor David K. Clements, a Lindell associate and \"election truther,\" talked about the potential Trump meeting ahead of time, during the cyber symposium. \"David said he was trying to get on as a lawyer for 45,\" Merritt said adding that Clements saw Lindell's relationship with Trump as a way to gain access to the inner circles of TrumpWorld.

        "articles": "Dr. Anthony Fauci unloaded on former President Donald Trump in an interview with the UK newspaper The Telegraph. Throughout the interview, Fauci recounted how his former boss would routinely take bad advice on how to handle the novel coronavirus pandemic and would act out whenever anyone with expertise contradicted him. \"When it became clear that in order to maintain my integrity and to get the right message [across] I had to publicly disagree with him, he did things -- or allowed things to happen -- that were terrible,\" Fauci told the paper. \"Like he allowed Peter Navarro [Trump's trade adviser] to write an editorial in USA Today saying that almost everything I've ever said was wrong.\" Fauci also blamed the president's regular criticism of him for the threats he and his family face to their safety. \"To this day I have to have armed federal agents guarding me all the time,\" Fauci said. Fauci also told The Telegraph that Trump completely lost any remaining interest he had in containing the pandemic after he lost the 2020 election, thus leaving it up to public health experts to try to contain the damage. \"We were trying, but we were acting almost alone, in the sense of without any direction,\" he said. \"When President Biden walked into the White House we were having 300,000 to 400,000 cases per day, 4,000 deaths per day, and our hospitals were on the brink of being overrun.\" Read the whole interview here (subscription required). Georgia resident Cleveland Meredith Jr., an armed Capitol rioter who threatened to kill Nancy Pelosi, has now pleaded guilty to sending threatening communications and faces up to five years in jail. CNN reports that Meredith, who earlier this year told a judge that he was \"just having fun\" with his deadly threats, is due to be sentenced in December after his guilty plea. On Friday, writing for The New York Times, conservative National Review writer Kevin Williamson outlined how Republicans are still trying to execute former President Donald Trump's coup attempt — and how the Capitol attack on January 6 was only the beginning of the effort. \"As the Republican Party tries to make up its mind between wishing away the events of Jan. 6 or celebrating them, one thing should be clear to conservatives estranged from the party: We can't go home again,\" wrote Williamson. \"The attempted coup's foot soldiers have dug themselves in at state legislatures. For example, last week in Florida State Representative Anthony Sabatini introduced a draft of legislation that would require an audit of the 2020 general election in the state's largest (typically Democratic-heavy) counties, suggesting without basis that it may show that these areas cheated to inflate Joe Biden's vote count.\" As President Joe Biden and health professionals urge Americans to get vaccinated and wear masks, one chiropractor in Pennsylvania is signing exemption forms for anyone seeking to evade public health measures. Chiropractor John Dorobish of Cherry Tree Chiropractic in Uniontown was interviewed by WTAE-TV about the state's new mask mandates for schools. ",

        "articles": "MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski blasted President Donald Trump for acting like an \"idiot\" and setting a horrible example during the coronavirus pandemic. The \"Morning Joe\" co-host said the president had neglected his duties throughout the public health crisis and needlessly politicized safety measures that can be easily taken by anyone to help prevent the virus from spreading. \"Since this president didn't respond to this pandemic and that is clearly logged in the history books for all Americans to see and hear and read for years to come,\" Brzezinski said, \"now you have a president who is actively working against the health of the American people in his words and in his actions. He won't wear a mask, he makes fun of people who wear masks, he makes sure his staff makes fun of people who wear masks. Masks can keep this virus from spreading. The president won't wear one and makes fun of people who wear them, and actually sets an example that you actually should not wear a mask, when it's the one thing that could actually keep this from spreading because we are so unprepared for this.\" \"Same with testing,\" she added. \"He keeps saying if we test more, we'll have more cases. Yes, idiot, we want to know where the virus is and where it isn't so we can protect people. Had we had testing in place, maybe at this point we'd be at mass testing. Maybe there'd be testing before people go into concerts and rallies so that we could make sure that these arenas and these public venues are safe, so that we could make sure that this economy could reopen.\" Brzezinski said the evidence was clear, and the president had bungled the response over and over, costing thousands of lives and causing economic devastation. \"Again and again and again the president works against himself and the health of the American people and continues to botch this,\" she said. \"That's what we're seeing happening. This is not me, you know, having a slant on it -- this is the reality. Look at the science, talk to your doctor, talk to scientists you trust and tell me that what I've said isn't exactly the case in terms of the example he's setting as a leader to try and keep this country safe.\" On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Delemus on nine federal charges -- including conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, threatening a federal law enforcement officer, obstruction of justice, attempting to impede or injure a federal law enforcement officer and several firearms charges, reported Portsmouth Patch. The Tea Party activist and outspoken Donald Trump supporter traveled cross-country in 2014 to take part in the armed standoff between Bureau of Land Management agents and Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and his militia supporters in a dispute over unpaid grazing fees. He was apparently the security team member who asked Jerad and Amanda Miller to leave the Bundy ranch just weeks before they gunned down two Las Vegas police officers. Delemus also traveled to Oregon in January to take part in the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Preserve. His wife, state Rep. Susan Delemus (R-Rochester) announced the arrest to the former chairman of New Hampshire's Republican Party -- who issued a call on Facebook for “all NH patriots to come together ASAP” to ”protest this tyranny in the most visible way possible.” “She said that the FBI just rolled up with lots of vehicles and Agents who were in tactical gear,” posted Jack Kimball, the former GOP chair. ”They forced their way into Jerry Delemus and Sue’s condo with weapons drawn and arrested Jerry and took him away.” Delemus and his wife have been quoted multiple times by local and national media about their support for Trump. Susan Delemus gained a measure of fame after she declared every politician but Trump was lying to her through the television. “We’ve got people in positions of power who I know for a fact are liars. Liars!” Delemus said. “I watch the TV — My president comes on the TV and he lies to me! I know he’s lying. He lies all the time.” She also made news four years ago, when she angrily confronted state officials in an attempt to keep Obama off the ballot in New Hampshire, causing the assistant secretary of state to fear for his safety. Most recently, Susan Delemus made news for siding with Trump in his feud with Pope Francis. “The Pope is the anti-Christ,\" Susan Delemus posted on her own Facebook page. \"Do your research.” Jerry DeLemus switched over in July from Sen. Ted Cruz’s leadership team in New Hampshire, and instead backed Trump because he’s an “anti-politician.” The failed candidate for \"constitutional candidate\" also organized the infamous rally where Trump failed to correct a man who called Obama a Muslim. Watch this video of Jerry Delemus discussing the Oregon occupation with now-jailed militant leader Ammon Bundy: Referring to it as a \"righteous strike,\" the U.S. Military carried out the last known drone strike in Afghanistan on Aug. 29, claiming they were targeting an ISIS suicide bomber who posed an imminent threat to U.S. troops. But a new report from The New York Times says that it was a case of mistaken identity that killed a U.S.-allied aid worker along with other innocent people. \"Military officials said they did not know the identity of the car's driver when the drone fired, but deemed him suspicious because of how they interpreted his activities that day, saying that he possibly visited an ISIS safe house and, at one point, loaded what they thought could be explosives into the car,\" the Times reports. In a 2018 interview with Lisa Luckett, whose husband Teddy worked and died in the World Trade Center building on September 11, 2001, Luckett told Salon one memory she never wants to forget from that horrific day was the \"beauty,\" \"grace,\" \"compassion,\" and \"incredible strength of the human spirit\" that followed. \"I never expected people to show up for me,\" Luckett said. Yet they did. CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale has debunked a viral video making false claims of mass walkouts by active duty service members who are refusing to get vaccinated. In the video, a bald man with sunglasses said that said he learned of mass walkouts by members of the military from his father. ",

That's what Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) learned the hard way when he lashed out at the Supreme Court's marriage equality ruling Friday with this tweet: The Supreme Court effectively legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states by ruling 5-4 that state bans on it are unconstitutional. Within 10 minutes, Vitter was reminded by journalist Sam Knight that those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Vitter admitted to being a client for so-called \"D.C. Madame\" Deborah Jeane Palfrey in 2007, The Week reports. Facing prison time, Palfrey committed suicide while Vitter skipped along to win re-election. In February that year, Vitter was also linked to a brothel in Louisiana, Fox News reported. Vitter's presentation of himself as a family values Republican is shaken by statements from Jeanette Maier, who Fox News quoted as saying Vitter was a Canal Street brothel client. She said things between Vitter and his wife didn't seem to be a Cleaver-esque picture of traditional family bliss. \"It wasn't all about sex,\" she told the Associated Press. \"In fact, he just wanted to have somebody listen to him, you know. And I said his wife must not be listening,\" Adding an additional layer of salaciousness, Larry Flynt took credit for outing Vitter with an investigative report in his magazine, Hustler, CNN reports. Twitter users were quick to pile on Vitter after his tweet, with one recalling that part of the allegations include him wanting prostitutes to make him wear diapers, according to Wonkette: @samknight1 @chrisricewriter @DavidVitter Vitter is a diaper fetishist isn't he the one taking a dump on the sanctity of marriage? 2/2 — Lacrymose (@Lacrymose)1435412599.0 On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

        "articles": "At a CNN town hall meeting on Wednesday, a Missouri police chief sternly reminded attendees about the Ku Klux Klan's historic influence on U.S. law enforcement. The town hall meeting was held on Wednesday, July 13 and discussed the topic of police violence and race. Col. K.L. Williams -- the black chief of police in Kinloch, Missouri -- told the panel that he had so many guns pointed at his head over the course of his youth that he is frankly amazed to be alive. \"I know I could never change the condition from the outside. I had to go for the inside,\" Williams said. \"If you think that racism and white supremacy is not involved in police departments, you better check yourself. Because the KKK has been involved with law enforcement from when it just about started,\" he continued. The Southern Poverty Law Center has extensively documented the Klan's activity in the U.S., which has come in cyclical waves since the hate group's inception during the Reconstruction Era. Often the Klan functioned as a covert enforcement arm of white governments, acting in secrecy to undermine the rights of blacks, Jews, immigrants and other groups.

        "articles": "A three-year girlfriend of Mark Judge has serious allegations that call into question his account of incidents at Georgetown Prep. Former Georgetown Prep student Eric Ruyak nailed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge in a Facebook post this week. He claimed Judge not only attacked him for outing a priest who molested youth but tried to blame it on \"unchecked liberalism.\" But now, Judge's ex-girlfriend is backing him up. In a story that outlined a second sexual assault accuser, Elizabeth Rasor came forward about her information on Judge and Kavanaugh. Rasor told New Yorker reporter Ronan Farrow that she met Judge at Catholic University and that she felt morally obligated challenging his characterization of \"horseplay\" in high school. \"Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't reveal information that was told in confidence,\" she said. However, \"I can't stand by and watch him lie.\" Judge told her a different story about an incident involving him and other boys taking turns having sex with a drunk woman. Judge made it sound consensual and never named any other men involved. She does not know whether Kavanaugh participated. After hearing the accusations and Judge's response, she noted dismissal of the high school incidents were not \"sexual innocence of Georgetown Prep.\" A second woman who attended high school in the 1980s in the same county as Georgetown Prep refuted Judge as well. In a letter to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and her attorneys, the woman said she witnessed boys at parties including Georgetown Prep students that engaged in \"sexual misconduct.\" The woman recalled male students who “would get a female student blind drunk” on what they called “jungle juice,\" which was grain alcohol and Hawaiian Punch. They would then try to take advantage of her. “It was disgusting,” the woman said. “They treated women like meat.” She wanted her identity withheld out of fear of political retribution. Two women have come forward accusing Kavanaugh of assault and attorney Michael Avenatti came forward Sunday saying he was representing a third accuser. Kavanaugh has also been accused of like his law clerks to have a \"certain look.\" He also clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski, who was forced to resign after multiple sexual harassment allegations. Kavanaugh then allegedly lied about what he knew. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

But Warbelow pointed out that cities around the country had been enacting similar ordinances for over 40 years. \"A couple of things I don't understand,\" Stam complained. \"When PayPal made its announcement that it was coming [with 400 more jobs] three weeks ago, North Carolina had the same law on discrimination that it has today.\" \"And this is the same with the NBA talking about not bringing an All-Star game to Charlotte,\" he continued. \"The Charlotte action is what the NBA and PayPal said they wanted to see so they're punishing Charlotte? Only Charlotte will suffer from that, not the rest of the state of North Carolina.\" \"The North Carolina law is uniquely terrible,\" Warbelow told Stam. \"I think maybe some of the legislators would understand it better if they had spent more than 12 hours shoving it through from both houses and signed into law.\" Warbelow noted that the law \"strips away protections for people of all characteristics: race, sex, disability.\" \"It stops cities from protecting their residents and visitors, including LGBT people,\" the HRC attorney added. \"And then has outrageous provisions making a subset of women -- transgender women and girls -- enter into men's restrooms in public buildings, from libraries to some of the major airports in the city.

According to Nye, Morano never invited him at all, but did interview him. Footage from that discussion is reportedly included in Morano's film, including Nye's call for organizations making a living denying global warming. \"I can see where people are very concerned about this and are pursuing criminal investigations as well engaging in discussions like this,\" Nye reportedly says in the film. \"They're keeping us from getting to work, they're holding us back.\" Palin, who has advocated for increases in drilling for oil and natural gas, responded by saying, \"Some people would say I'm pushing progress and development too aggressively, certainly not holding anybody back, I want people to work, I want people to produce.\" However, the former vice-presidential candidate's accusations regarding Nye's background do not hold up. Nye earned a Bachelors of Science from Cornell University, where he studied mechanical engineering.

        "articles": "Late Thursday night, the House of Representatives voted in favor of \"H.J.Res. 43: Disapproving the action of the District of Columbia Council in approving the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014.\" If enacted, the legislation would make using employer-based health insurance for in vitro fertilization or birth control pills a fireable offense in Washington, D.C. Planned Parenthood has been mobilizing its network against the bill. \"Your boss shouldn’t be able to fire you for using birth control,\" the organization states. Thursday's House floor debate kicked off after 9:00 PM. Before I entered the doors to the House Gallery, I complied with a police request to forfeit all my electronic devices. I inquired if I could get a press pass so I could take pictures. After a few radio calls, officials on the scene told me I could not have a press pass. So I relinquished my phone and proceeded to go in the Gallery anyway. Before going through my second metal detector since entering the building, a police officer gave my purse a thorough examination. I had already put my purse through an x-ray machine. When I entered the Gallery, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) was imploring her Republican colleagues not to use the federal authority vested in them by people from other states to overturn local laws in Washington, D.C. I sat down near D.C. voting rights activists who were attending the hearing and began to take notes on a steno pad. A congressional staffer came over and informed me I was not allowed to take notes. I witnessed testimony from Representative Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), a combat veteran whose radiation exposure made it difficult to conceive a child. The Congresswoman recently gave birth; she believes in vitro fertility treatments made conception possible for her. H.J.Res. 43, if enacted, would mean a boss who disagrees with in vitro fertilization could fire an employee for getting pregnant that way. Also on the floor last night, Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) dubbed H.J.Res. 43 \"Hobby Lobby on steroids,\" Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) called for D.C. statehood from the house floor, and numerous Republicans defended \"religious freedom.\" I left the hearing a little after 10:00 PM to find a place with CSPAN so I could actually take notes. By the time I got home, the House had voted in favor of H.J.Res. 43. With support from 225 Republicans and 3 Democrats, the U.S. Congress moved to overturn a democratically enacted law in the District of Columbia for the first time in more than 20 years. While members of Congress voted last night, Norton could only sit in the chamber and watch. Tweets Roll Call journalist Bridget Bowman: DC's delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton sits in the chamber as other members vote to block DC law. Norton doesn't have a vote on the House floor — Bridget Bowman (@Bridget Bowman)1430448324.0 H.J.Res. 43 now goes to the Senate for consideration. Though its population is greater than that of either Vermont or Wyoming, Washington, D.C. (whose population is about 50 percent black) has limited presidential voting rights, no vote in Congress, and the inability to raise local revenues or pass local laws without Congressional permission. For over a decade, for example, the U.S. Congress made it a federal crime for the D.C. government to spend locally-raised tax dollars for HIV prevention programming. Today, the District has one of the highest HIV rates in the nation. Conservative members of Congress regularly engage in legislative hijinks to mess with D.C.'s gun laws. In July, for example, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) inserted an amendment into the Bipartisan Sportsmen’s Act would have mostly nullified gun control policies in D.C. (with carve outs for federal buildings, like the Capitol). If Paul had has his way, the U.S. Government would have had the following impacts on D.C. local laws: \"repeal registration requirement, end the ban on semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines, expand the right to carry guns outside the home and protect the right to carry guns on federal land in D.C. and elsewhere in the country. In essence, the bill would eliminate the District’s local gun laws, leaving only federal firearms law to regulate gun ownership and use in the city.\" The federal government first permitted the District of Columbia to vote for its own mayor and city council in 1973. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G. Newell, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:43 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced. A judge since 2016 and before that Caroline County's top prosecutor for more than a decade, he was to be taken into custody on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child, prosecutors said,\" reported Justin Fenton. \"A boy that Newell took on a hunting trip on Hoopers Island discovered a hidden camera in the bathroom on July 23, and his parents reported it to police, which The Sun reported last week.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Friday criticized President Joe Biden for ending the war in Afghanistan, which dragged on for two decades. Before taking over Strom Thurmond's seat in the U.S. Senate, Graham voted for the war in Afghanistan as a member of the House of Representatives. The United States may soon hit yet another major milestone in its efforts to vaccinate its citizens against the novel coronavirus. Reuters reports that American regulators could authorize Pfizer's vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 as soon as the end of October. ",

        "articles": "MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell is building a high-profile legal team to defend him against a billion-dollar defamation suit that he hopes will land before the U.S. Supreme Court. The staunch Donald Trump ally has hired veteran First Amendment attorney Nathan Lewin and is getting advice from Alan Dershowitz for his defense against Dominion Voting Systems, which alleges that Lindell defamed the company with baseless claims about the 2020 election, reported The Daily Beast. \"I want to take this all the way to the Supreme Court,\" Lindell has repeatedly said. \"I'm not stopping.\" The 85-year-old Lewin helped prosecute Jimmy Hoffa for Bobby Kennedy's Justice Department, and later represented Jodie Foster, former attorney general Edwin Meese, President Richard Nixon and John Lennon, and Dershowitz -- who defended Trump during his first impeachment -- gave a preview of Lindell's defense. \"Our position is that Dominion is the government, for purposes of the First Amendment,\" Dershowitz said. \"The government delegated to them the most important governmental function, mainly counting votes in a presidential election, and they are therefore subject to criticism in the exact same ways that the government would be subject to criticism in that situation, and criticism of how the government conducted a presidential election is the highest bar protecting the First Amendment right to criticize such action.\" Dershowitz is not an attorney of record in the case, but he confirmed that he's been helping Lindell's team craft a defense. \"I've been on conference calls repeatedly with [Lindell's] legal team, sometimes Lindell is on, sometimes he's not,\" Dershowitz said. \"My role is to come up with ideas as they pertain to the First Amendment. I give them cases, and I suggest First Amendment theories — my role is limited to advising on the First Amendment issues at hand.\" Did the Cyber Ninjas botch another attempt to recount Maricopa County's 2020 presidential ballots—an attempt that, so far, has escaped wide media coverage? It appears, at the very least, that a contract signed on July 28 by the Cyber Ninjas—the lead contractor in the Arizona Senate Republicans' election review—and Dr. V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai, a Boston-based technologist and unsuccessful GOP U.S. Senate candidate, indicated that all 2020 election results would be tallied by August—and that deadline has now been missed. On Friday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a federal judge is refusing to release Jacob Chansley, an infamous January 6 Capitol rioter known as the \"QAnon Shaman,\" to St. Louis ahead of his sentencing. \"U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth's order was made public Friday,\" reported Robert Patrick. \"Chansley was required to show by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community, and Lamberth said he failed. Although Chansley's lawyer, Albert Watkins, had arranged for a place for Chansley to stay, with mental health treatment, Watkins failed to show how anyone would prevent Chansley from fleeing the area. Watkins' plan also does not mitigate the possibility that Chansley's supporters would provide him money to flee, the judge said.\" The 9/11 terrorist attacks did not just result in major changes to the U.S. government, but also the press corps. With President George W. Bush banging the drums of war, much of the national press rallied around the flag as Congress voted to invade Afghanistan, pass the Patriot Act, invade Iraq and create the Department of Homeland Security.

        "articles": "Media exit polls in last Tuesday's election suggested Democrats were going to win the White House and the Senate, yet the reported vote counts brought a GOP landslide. While theories abound about what happened, election integrity activists say the exit poll descrepancy underscores the need for a far more transparent and accountable process. AlterNet's Steven Rosenfeld interviewed Jonathan Simon, a longtime exit poll sleuth and author of Code Red: Computerized Election Theft and the New American Century. Simon explains why exit polls are a critical clue in the breakdown of the voting process. Steven Rosenfeld: Let's start by telling people about your involvement with election integrity and tracking exit polls. Jonathan Simon: I've been working in this field which we call election forensics for about 15 years, since the 2000 election. Certainly things kicked in with the 2004 election and the exit polls there. I was actually the person who downloaded the exit polls that were left up on the CNN website which then made it possible to compare the unadjusted exit polls—and we can explain that in a bit—but comparing the exit polls with the vote counts and show through all those disparities that there was reason to suspect possibly manipulation of the vote counts. It has deep roots and basically looking at every election since has found varying, but at the same time, fairly pervasive patterns of what we call the \"red shift\" and where the exit polls are to the west of the vote counts. We track that, we record it and we attempt to analyze it and get some sort of handle on what has caused it as a phenomenon. Then we look at all sorts of forensic data, accumulative vote share, tables and hand counts where we can find them. I've always been particularly conscientious about trying to take whatever baseline we're using and validate that baseline, so that if we have an exit poll for instance, we try to make sure something that has been skewed by over-sampling one party or over-sampling people of color or something to that effect and validate it by that. We try as carefully as we can. I've been doing this pretty steadily now for the last 15 years along with some of my colleagues, and I would be the first to acknowledge that there is a lot of smoke there and there's a lot of probative value to this work, but that bringing it forth as ironclad proof is very problematic. So we're stuck at a place where I pivoted to is looking at the risk involved in having a computerized, privatized, unobservable vote counting system and just taking on faith that that system is not being manipulated when there is such a obvious vulnerability (on which the experts strongly agree) of the system to malfeasance and manipulation. That is where I've tended to go, is to look at that risk rather than screaming fraud from the rooftops and claiming proof. SR: Let's go through this piece by piece, because it's a lot for people to really understand. You get the raw state-by-state exit polls that are commissioned by a big consortium of national media organizations. What did you find this year, that happened this week? What do you see in the raw data? JS: Of course, we don't get the raw data. The raw data would be... we have three definitions here. There's raw data, which is the actual questionnaires and the simple numerical toning up of answers on the questionnaire. That is never publicly released. It's if you want to characterize it as such, it's what's inside the sausage of exit polls, and we are not privileged to see that. I've had one opportunity in my life through an inside source to actually look at some of the raw data, but that's a very rare thing. It's not generally accessible to the public. Many of us have clamored for the public release of that raw data, certainly in the aftermath of the 2004 election and have been denied it. Then there is the weighted exit poll data and that's what the exit pollsters put out as soon as the polls close. This has been demographically weighted to their best approximation of what the electorate looked like and it is very valuable information. That's what I was able to download in 2004 and that's what I was able to download in many of the elections since, and that's what I was able to download this Tuesday. Then you have adjusted exit polls and what happens is they take the vote counts as they come in and they use the term as the art of \"forcing,\" they force the exit polls to [be] congruent with that vote count data so that by the end of the night or by the next morning when you have your final vote counts and final exit polls the exit polls and the vote counts will match, but that's only because in essence they've been forced to match the vote counts. SR: I'm looking at the New York Times website right now, at its election 2016 exit polls interactive. What are the totals then that I'm seeing? JS: I'm not looking at the New York Times. I've pulled these off of CNN and I'm also looking at MSNBC. Because the firm that does this, Edison, contracts with the consortium of major networks and then has some lesser clients such as the New York Times. When I say lessor, they're still very major clients, they just don't have the prime membership that these five networks and the AP have, but all these major clients get the same feed of weighted exit poll data. What you're probably looking at now would be adjusted exit polls and they're very close to, if not congruent with the vote counts. But if you had looked up Tuesday night, for instance, if a poll closed at 7pm Eastern Time and you had gone online to a network site at 7:01pm Eastern Time, what you would have seen at that point was a weighted poll that had not yet been adjusted to match the vote counts. They would tell you the number of respondents. They'd give you all the cross tabs, by which I mean broken down by gender, age, income, party affiliation, usually 30 to 40, sometimes 50 questions ... Pretty detailed stuff that indicated how each subgroup of the polled population had answered these various questions. Some of those questions are demographic questions: What is your race? What is your income level? What party do you identify with? Who did you vote for in the last election? etc., etc. ... Then there are the current choice questions. Who did you just vote for this evening and/or this afternoon? Those are all presented in sort of a scroll fashion. You can pull that up on all these websites. However, they will change over time as the vote counts come in. That's why we screen-capture these initial public postings, because that contains the purest information in terms of not relying on the vote counts and if we're approaching this with a certain amount of suspicion of the vote counts we're trying to verify or validate the vote counts we want exit polls that are independent as possible from the actual vote count data, which then becomes blended in as the evening goes on from the time the polls close until whenever the final vote counts are available. That vote count data becomes blended in with the exit poll algorithm and gradually pulls the exit polls in congruence with the vote counts, at which point they're used for academic analysis of demographics, but they're not anymore used for validating the vote counts. SR: Tell me again what the 'red shift' is and how you saw this shift again this year. JS: The red shift is a term that I coined back in 2004 after the Bush-Kerry election, because the familiar term the \"red shift\" when we mean astronomy, that's what brought it to my mind. But the reason it's called the red shift is that it was very directional in that election where you saw vote counts coming out more in favor of Bush, more in favor of Republican candidates. Since Republican by that time had been designated red as in red states and blue states, that's how it got the moniker the red shift. What we found from that point forward is that it's almost a singularity, very rare, that we find any significant blue shift anywhere. When we look at exit polls and vote counts, what we're almost always seeing are vote counts that come out more in favor of the Republican candidate than the exit polls and in the case of intraparty nomination battles, more in favor of the candidate that is, I guess you'd have to say, to the right of their opponent. For instance, in the 2016 primaries, a massive shift of exit polls state after state after state, in favor of Hillary Clinton. The vote counts were more in favor of Clinton than the exit polls, which were more in favor of Bernie Sanders. We saw a very consistent pattern of that. In this past Tuesday, again we saw a very consistent pattern of exit polls that were more in favor of Hillary Clinton, more in favor of Democratic senatorial candidates and then vote counts were shifted from the exit polls to the right towards Donald Trump, towards the Republican senate candidates. Those are the figures that I pulled down and did a very basic analysis of. You have a column of numbers of state by state showing the degree of that shift and we'll eventually do that for the national vote for the House of Representatives as well. SR: When you see this discrepancy, without being overly simplistic, the question becomes, why is it there and what caused it? You've been through this four or five times and not even counting the midterm elections. What do you think is really going on when you see this general one-way shifting? Does it mean the polling is wrong? Does it mean the voting machinery is being tampered with? Does it mean both? How do you explain or understand this? JS: What it means to me is that neither system is self validating. Neither system can be trusted. If you look at accounting, you do double entry accounting. I'm not an accountant so my terminology may be off, but you basically audit by checking one column of numbers against another column of numbers. If they disagree, you know something is wrong somewhere. There is some arithmetical mistake, some failure of entry, possibly fraud ... you don't know. You just know that if two things that are pretty much supposed to agree had disagreed, there's a problem somewhere. I can rule out mathematically and scientifically, by this time, errors due to random chance. Errors due to random chance, sampling errors, what we call margin of error issues, would not be expressing themselves so consistently in one direction. They'd be going in both directions and they'd be much smaller. If you take a mathematical sample of a whole ... if you take a blood draw in a person and you look at 1,000 or so blood cells as represented in of all their millions of blood cells, that's guaranteed to be a random sample. It's not like all the bad blood cells hide out in a single vein or something. From that, you get a very clear and crisp mathematical margin of error and it tells you how likely you are to be within X number of percent about what the truth is about the entire target that you're looking at of the blood of the whole body. That's how you can make a diagnosis based on a pinprick. In exit polling it's not that simple. In exit polling you have sampling that is not purely mathematically random. First of all, it's done in clusters because it would be an impractical matter to catch people all over the state randomly coming out at the polls. You'd have to have a person at each precinct, etc. We're not even talking about early voting and absentee voting. Let's just leave that out of the equation and assume everybody votes on election day. You'd still have to go to thousands of precincts. It would be prohibitively expensive. What they do instead, and I was a pollster for a couple of years quite long ago, but the methods haven't changed that much, you basically cluster sample. You pick 20 or 30 precincts that are representative politically and demographically of the whole state and those are the precincts in which you do all your interviews. That adds mathematically about a 30 percent increase to the margin of error, to the inaccuracy if you want to call that of the poll. It's certainly a tolerable change or loss of accuracy that can be factored in mathematically, but the real problems come up in exit polling with selection bias, response bias, the possibility of people lying to the pollster, etc. These are the things that have been seized on by those who have debunked the exit polls and said they're worthless. They're not worthless and at the same time they're not best evidence. Best evidence would be the voter marked paper ballots. Best evidence would be the memory cards in the computers and what program is actually determining how these votes are counted, what the code is on those memory cards. Exit polls are indirect. They're statistical evidence and they have flaws that are difficult to quantify. When you see pervasive patterns where it is substantial well beyond the margin of error repeatedly in the same direction, in particular when you've been able to independently validate the demographics of the exit poll sample. This is the work that I did. It's in my book, Code Red: Computerized Election Theft in the New American Century. SR: So this is a persuasive and recurring pattern and not just in this week’s vote? JS: In the 2016 primary, we compared the performance of the exit polls in the Republican primaries with the performance of the exit poll in the Democratic primaries. There was a glaring difference. I call these \"second order comparatives.\" Second order comparatives are very important because you're essentially validating your baseline by doing that. If you're conscientious about election forensics, that's the work that you try to do. Does it add up to ironclad proof? No, but it's a very consistent pattern that is absolutely probative enough that it says, Okay, we want to now take a look at the other system and how the votes are being counted. When you look at that other system and how the votes are being counted, your hair stands on end because it's so vulnerable to not just outsider hacking, but to insider manipulation as well. There are certainly a lot of anecdotal instances of this. For instance, just in this particular election, they bought machines in Ohio that had a feature in them that was basically capable of self auditing. It was a security feature. The Republican secretary of state of Ohio allowed the counties to switch off that feature. You have to ask why. You bought it and it had that feature. They said, Well, it would create chaos. You look at things like that and say hmm. You scratch your head and say, what is going on here? What may be happening in that darkness of cyberspace that the exit polls are giving us a pretty good hint about, but the vote counting system itself completely conceals? SR: Let's talk about what you found this week. I'm looking at your 2016 presidential chart. I'm looking at North Carolina for example, where it says the exit poll margin was 2.1% ahead for Clinton, but the final vote count showed Trump with a 3.8% lead. You have similar 4.4% Clinton lead in Pennsylvania but then losing by 1.2% to Trump, a 5.6% shift. You have Florida where she was ahead in exit polls by 1.3% and ends up losing by 1.3%, a 2.6% shift. Is there any reason you can point to as to why you are seeing that in so many different states? JS: First of all, let me preface it that what they've done since 2004 is exit poll fewer and fewer states. I think there were about 30 states exit polled this time, 20 states were left out because they were considered to be locks, non-competitive. What that does for a forensic standpoint is that it cuts our baseline... It's as if they had a certain limited amount of resources, and they decided to really plow it into getting larger sample sizes in states that they knew were going to be competitive and possibly controversial. North Carolina was one of those. I believe it had the largest sample size in the country. It was almost 4,000 voters were sampled and the usual sample size in these state exit polls is somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 if they expect it to be competitive. That was basically a double sampling that reduces the mathematical margin of error, but it also improves in a less quantifiable way the accuracy of the poll. That 5.9% red shift from Clinton to Trump is way outside the margin of error for that poll and therefore very unlikely to occur by chance. What might have made it happen? People could've been lying to the exit pollster. The exit pollster could've been all young urban college kids and the Trump voters might have been reluctant to comply with their requests. There might have been refusals from Trump voters. Now Edison usually tries to get these things right and one of the ways they try to get it right is through some expensive training and they try to get a fairly represented sample of polling interviewers. The polls by the way are confidential. They're not verbal interviews. You're just handed a clipboard with a poll on it. It's not as intimate as some people would believe. There's less of an incentive to lie because it's basically confidential. You fold your polling sheet up and you put it in the box or you hand it back to the interviewer to put it into a grab bag. There's no name on it. There is nothing that associates you with it. The incentive to lie isn't particularly high. We've always dealt with the—is there a reluctant [George W.] Bush responder going on here, is there a shy Trump voter? We don't know. These are possibilities, but we've seen the same kind of exit poll pattern in intraparty contests, we've seen it year after year, we've seen it at the Senate races, at the House exit poll. It transcends an individual race like this where there was so much intensity. If you want to sleep well at night, which I also prefer to denial, and you want to say to yourself, Yeah, it must have been people just lying to the exit pollsters and I'm not going to worry about it, that's fine. What you're missing at that point is the fact that if you challenge me to say, How do you know these exit polls are valid? I would turn right around and challenge you and say, How do you know the vote counts are valid? The fact is, and this is cold hard fact, neither of us can prove our case. That is the problem. We have an unobservable system that cannot answer the challenge that it might be subject to manipulation. It can't demonstrate that it is not rigged. Exit polls are just a tool that we use to look at it and say, Well folks, there might be something to dig deeper into here. The problem is virtually never is anyone allowed to dig deeper. We have optical scanner equipment all over this country right now that have the voter marked ballots that drop through the optical-scan reader device and sit in their cabinet below. Those voter marked ballots need to be saved 22 months in theory, although they've been destroyed early, in fact, in many cases, especially if when there was an investigation going on in Ohio. You have these voter marked ballots that would have probably not been destroyed within two days of the election and they're there. They theoretically could be exhumed and examined. You could go machine by machine, you could look at them in public and you could compare them with machine counts, then you could reconcile those machine counts with the central tabulator. County counts, and state counts ... You could say, Yes, this was a valid election or no, this was not a valid election. We had a problem. Might have been fraud, might have been a glitch, we don't know. The fact is, nobody has access to those ballots. They are corporate property. They are off limits to public inspection. It might as well, in the 99.9% of cases, be a paperless touchscreen that has no record whatsoever. The fact is, we are denied, when I saw we, the candidates, the public, very often election administrators, by the rules of their states, are denied access to the actual hard evidence we call it, that would allow a determination of whether the election has been accurately counted or perhaps has been illegitimately counted and manipulated. As a matter of fact, in quite a few states and usually under Republican control, but the Democrats have not been tremendously cooperative about this either. The trend has been for ballots to be removed from public record status so that they are no longer susceptible to four-year requests and similar public information requests, Freedom of Information Act requests. They are getting less transparent, not more so. SR: Where do we stand today? You have your exit poll analysis that says something is not right here. We look at the results. We don't have access to the ballots. We really don't have meaningful audit or recounting possibilities. People are just left feeling very upset and powerless and then the days pass and attention goes elsewhere and the election machinery and the polling machinery largely remains the same. Am I wrong? Am I missing something? JS: I couldn't have stated that better. There was a Supreme Court case famously where it had to do with pregnancy and it stood for mootness; when cases became moot because they couldn't be heard in time so they had to do either abortion or pregnancy. By the time it came up through the channels, the time had passed and the woman was no longer pregnant and the issue was moot. In a similar kind of way we go through these cycles. Interest heightens right before the election. If there is high suspicion of fraud, which sometimes as there sometimes are. If in presidential elections, 2004 obviously being the major one and then this one, there is a flurry of interest, a kind of window of opportunity, but the public attention span and the media attention span in particular is very short. We live in a sound-bite society. There's always other stuff to attend to. People are busy. People are working hard. By and large, you couldn't find a subject that is less sexy than election forensics. The Kardashians are a lot sexier as is the football games on Sunday. So yes, it passes briefly in front of the public eye. There's a lot of stirring about it and then it dies out and it's basically left to us hardcore election integrity advocates. This is catastrophic. This is tragic. What we're left with is a system that was accepted more or less without real proof. If that's what democracy is worth to us, then we deserve what we get. Democracy requires support. It requires citizen support. It requires an investment of care and an investment of vigilance and an investment of participation more than deciding, Yeah, I'm going to vote or I'm not going to vote. It requires the fulfillment of a duty to be part of the public that counts and observe the counting of the votes so we don't have the ludicrous situation where we hand our ballots to a magician who takes them behind a curtain, you hear them shred the ballots, comes out and tells you so-and-so won. This is what we've got now and it's what we've accepted. We spend more money in two weeks in Iraq then would cost us for 30 years to hand-count our elections. This is surrealistic, this is absurd, but it's the very strong inertial reality. Getting the energy up to change that reality, especially when that reality has worked well by definition for everybody who is sitting in office. They're the people with the least incentive to look under the hood and say, Hey, we need to change this. It's what put them in office. You will rarely meet a politician or a journalist with a seat at or anywhere near the adult table who wants to rock this boat, who wants to pull the cover off of this thing, who wants to restore public sovereignty. One other point about that is that the musical Hamilton is popular now and Hamilton was notoriously an elitist. Somebody who really didn't believe in full franchise as many of the founding fathers, of course. Women didn't vote, blacks didn't vote, etc. You had to have property to vote in certain states. There's a strain of that elitism that pervades the highly educated classes that tend to fill the political offices and tend to fill the journalistic offices around this country. These are people with high education, high capabilities. They look out at the American people and rightly or wrongly, if I channel what they see, they see a mass of Kardashian following and football fanatic uninformed people. That's our public. That's our sovereignty. That's what they see from their perch. It's very understandable in a way that they're not all that excited about restoring the sovereignty of that group because they don't really trust it. In their minds, [the] last people you'd want making decisions about whether to war with Iraq or Russia or do this or that deal politically are a bunch of people who come on, flip on the TV, tune on \"Dancing with the Stars\" and drink a couple of beers. There's not a whole lot of belief in public sovereignty, right or wrong. As moronic as one might believe a good part of this public is, it's really the experts who keep wandering into the minefield. The public knows more than they're given credit for. One of the things that's going on in this election manifests through Bernie Sanders, manifests through Donald Trump, is a very widespread recognition of that reality, whether they'd call it exactly such or not, a recognition that we are not being listened to, we are not being heard, we are not being considered. So there is this huge populist uprising. Was there enough to give Donald Trump the victory? That remains to be seen and may never be seen, but it was certainly enough to give both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump the kind of support that was shocking to the journalistic establishment and to the political establishment. They're not being the elites that they are ... and yet they are not advocating for having a vote counting system that accurately, publicly and verifiably translates the will of that public into leadership policy and direction. That's in large part what's led us into the place that we're in today, November 10th. SR: Thank you, this is very good. There's a lot here. I hope people will take the time to understand that something is not right with both the exit polls or the vote count machinery, and at a deep systemic level there are questions that are not being answered. I respect the work you’ve done, as discouraging as its findings are.

        "articles": "President Donald Trump may not have to look far to begin his \"major investigation\" into so-called voter fraud because his top White House adviser, Steve Bannon, is reportedly registered to vote in two different states. In a tweet on Wednesday, Trump defended his assertion that 3 to 5 million \"illegal\" voters caused him to lose the popular vote. even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures! — Donald J. Trump (@Donald J. Trump)1485346426.0 According to The Guardian, one of the people guilty of being registered in two states is White House strategist Steve Bannon. An investigation by the paper found that Bannon registered to vote in New York last year even though he was already on the rolls in Florida. Bannon lists his New York apartment as his current voting address. But he also claims the home of Andy Badolato as his address for voting in Florida. The Guardian notes that records show Bannon cast his vote in New York and not Florida, meaning that no crime was committed. Being registered to vote in two locations is not in itself illegal.

        "articles": "The presidential candidacy of businessman Donald Trump has been a rich vein of comedy gold for Last Week Tonight host John Oliver, who once again hammered the buffoonish billionaire on Sunday night -- this time for his ignorance of all things nuclear. Calling Trump “America’s potential next president,” the HBO host noted that Trump seemed ill-equipped to talk seriously about foreign policy and nuclear proliferation. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper last Tuesday, Trump glibly suggested that countries that live under the umbrella of American security should step up, protect themselves and be allowed to possess nuclear weapons. “At some point we have to say, you know what, we’re better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea,” Trump told Cooper. “We’re better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself.” Asked about Saudi Arabia getting nukes, Trump replied: “Saudi Arabia? Absolutely.” “He says that with the confidence of a man who could easily find Saudi Arabia on a map if he was given three tries -- and the map only included countries ending with ‘Arabia,’” a smirking Oliver said. Trump also stated that nukes could be used in Europe because: “Europe is a big place.” \"It's 'a big place' is not a good excuse for using nuclear weapons,\" Oliver explained. \"It's barely a good excuse for peeing in the ocean.\" Oliver then turned to comments made by President Obama about Trump's interview, with the president stating that Trump “doesn’t know much about foreign policy, or nuclear policy, or the Korean Peninsula, or the world generally.” “President Obama is basically implying there that you could fill a book with the things Donald Trump doesn’t know,” Oliver translated. “That book being the encyclopedia.” Watch the video below via YouTube: On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

        "articles": "While the Senate Republicans cobble together a healthcare law that would eviscerate funding to Medicaid, the Trump administration pulled $213.6 million from programs that work to prevent teen pregnancy. The Center for Investigative Reporting revealed the administration has gutted funding for research and programs at more than 80 institutions including Children's Hospital in Los Angeles and John Hopkins University. The decision was made by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services headed by Secretary Tom Price (R-GA). As a Congressman, Price argued that \"not one\" woman ever struggled to afford birth control, telling ThinkProgress, \"Bring me one woman\" who doesn't have access to birth control. The programs in place were designed to give teens medically accurate information to help protect themselves against unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. However, Price has long been supportive of ineffective abstinence-only education programs. He claimed such scientifically accurate programs \"promotes promiscuity among young people.\" Price isn't the only one at HHS who wants to see such programs lose funding. Teresa Manning was appointed the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs to oversee the distribution of federal funding of family planning funding as part of Title X. In a 2003 radio interview, Manning outright disputed the effectiveness of contraception. \"Of course, contraception doesn't work. Its efficacy is very low,\" she said. Her opinion is scientifically inaccurate as birth control methods have a 91 to 99 percent effective rate when \"typically used\" and the rate is even hire with \"perfect\" use, according to the Center for Disease Control. The move ends a five-year grant program instituted by former President Barack Obama's administration aimed at finding scientifically accurate ways to help teens make healthy decisions that help them avoid unwanted pregnancies. More than one-fourth of girls become pregnant before age 20 despite declines over the last two decades. The rate still remains high compared to other industrialized nations. One program worked with the Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma through Johns Hopkins' to combat teen pregnancy. They've also worked with the Apaches in Arizona and through a University of Texas program that did guidance for youth in foster care. The Chicago Department of Health will also lose funding for a counseling and testing program for sexually transmitted infections. The program cuts aren't even pro-abstinence, as it will cut funding for a University of Southern California program that held workshops for parents who needed help talking to their children about delaying sexual activity. “We are just reeling. We’re not sure how we’ll adapt,” said associate research professor Jennifer Hettema, at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. “They don’t like to deal with the sexual reproductive health of teens,” said Pat Paluzzi, who works at the Healthy Teen Network in Baltimore. “They frame it in this country as moral issues. Public health issues shouldn’t be political issues.” Some grantees were told by HHS officials that the decision came directly from Manning's office. University of Southern California associate professor Luanne Rohrbach said that her programs have developed scientifically based information as part of preventative medicine programs. “We took decades of research on how to effectively approach prevention and have applied it on a large scale nationally,” she said. “We’re not out there doing what feels good. We’re doing what we know is effective. There are a lot of data from the program to show that it works.” President Donald Trump appointed Valerie Huber, a new chief of staff for the Office of Adolescent Health. She's been a vocal critic of Obama's sexual health education programs that used a comprehensive approach with scientifically accurate information. “Pro-sex organizations used every opportunity to attack abstinence education,” Huber wrote in a 2014 paper with co-author Michael Firmin. “This agenda was (and is) at least as much about destroying abstinence education as it is about supporting ‘comprehensive’ sex education. … The current Obama administration has used its fiscal scalpel to eliminate the growth of abstinence education within America’s school systems.” Teen birth rates remain higher in the United States than other international counterparts. In 1991, 62 out of every 1,000 women 15 to 19 gave birth. By 2014 that number dropped to 24 teens. Health officials say that the primary reason is attributed to a greater access to birth control as sexual activity has remained constant over the same time frame. By contrast, research shows that abstinence-only education delays sexual activity by no more than 18 months and those teens are more likely to contract sexually transmitted diseases because they aren't informed about ways to protect themselves. They were also less likely to seek medical testing and treatment for their STIs. The Trump budget would further cut Medicaid by $800 billion, including nutritional assistance by $192 billion, and $272 billion from welfare programs overall. \"I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy,\" Trump tweeted on International Women's Day in March. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

Politico reports that Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) is still clashing with fellow Republicans over whether to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6th riots at the United States Capitol building. While Republican minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has endorsed a commission to investigate all kinds of political violence, Cheney tells Politico that a commission is needed solely for the January 6th riots because they were aimed at the peaceful transition of power. \"If we minimize what happened on Jan. 6th and if we appease it, then we will be in a situation where every election cycle, you could potentially have another constitutional crisis,\" she said. \"If you get into a situation where we don't guarantee a peaceful transfer of power, we won't have learned the lessons of Jan. 6.\" Cheney added that the Republican Party \"can't bury our head in the sand\" because \"it matters hugely to the survival of the country.\" For his part, McCarthy threw subtle jabs at Cheney for remaining outspoken against the former president. \"There's a responsibility, if you're gonna be in leadership, leaders eat last,\" he told Politico. \"And when leaders try to go out, and not work as one team, it creates difficulties.\" On Friday, writing for The New York Times, conservative National Review writer Kevin Williamson outlined how Republicans are still trying to execute former President Donald Trump's coup attempt — and how the Capitol attack on January 6 was only the beginning of the effort. \"As the Republican Party tries to make up its mind between wishing away the events of Jan. 6 or celebrating them, one thing should be clear to conservatives estranged from the party: We can't go home again,\" wrote Williamson. \"The attempted coup's foot soldiers have dug themselves in at state legislatures. For example, last week in Florida State Representative Anthony Sabatini introduced a draft of legislation that would require an audit of the 2020 general election in the state's largest (typically Democratic-heavy) counties, suggesting without basis that it may show that these areas cheated to inflate Joe Biden's vote count.\" As President Joe Biden and health professionals urge Americans to get vaccinated and wear masks, one chiropractor in Pennsylvania is signing exemption forms for anyone seeking to evade public health measures. Chiropractor John Dorobish of Cherry Tree Chiropractic in Uniontown was interviewed by WTAE-TV about the state's new mask mandates for schools. A former CIA analyst and current Brookings Institute senior fellow delivered a shocking revelation on Friday when he claimed that former President George W. Bush told then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair that he was going to attack Iraq just three days after the 9/11 attacks. During a forum discussion about the legacy of 9/11, Brookings counterterrorism expert Bruce Riedel revealed that he recently started looking back through a journal that he had kept while serving on Bush's National Security Council in the early years of his administration.

        "articles": "Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) said that Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) is never going to be the Speaker, former Republican Rep. David Jolly (FL) explained on MSNBC Tuesday. According to Jolly, the reason that McCarthy and other Republicans want to block any Jan. 6 Commission is that it might expose their involvement or coordination. \"Now Kevin does not want it to go forward it's because we know the focus will be on the culpability of Republican behavior, not just Donald Trump's behavior but Republican behavior going into Jan. 6th,\" Jolly explained. \"The luscious irony in all of this is just as Kevin's handling of the Benghazi commission, some would argue derailed his ascension to the speakership. When he went on Fox News and said this was all about taking down Hillary Clinton, it wasn't about Benghazi. Just as that derailed his speakership, a Jan. 6th Commission could derail it at the speakership as well. It could focus on what he knows about the events. When Liz Cheney says he should testify, it's not just because she wants to get to the truth. She's said that McCarthy won't be Speaker. Which tells me that Liz Cheney knows that Kevin McCarthy knows something that is so damning it would undo his ascension to the speakership should he go under oath before a Jan. 6th Commission.\" Republicans are desperately trying to make the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol the same as burning the Wendy's a year earlier during protests after another shooting of an unarmed person of color. \"This is what makes this so insane, I don't know why the Democrats are even bothering to try and make it a bipartisan commission at this point,\" Dr. Jason Johnson explained. \"The Republicans know that many of them are potentially complicit in not standing up when this was happening or obfuscating people who might have been involved.\" He cited Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), who indicated that she witnessed Republican officials giving tours to people she later saw at the insurrection. \"The Republican Party doesn't want a real investigation,\" he explained. \"This is like the Empire saying, 'OK, you got the Death Star, we don't have to do the whole investigation into Darth Vader.

        "articles": "Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant complained Christians are still being bullied in his state because not everyone agrees with their interpretation of a law that permits discrimination against LGBT people. Bryant insisted the law was intended to prevent discrimination against Christians by allowing them to deny service, housing, medical treatment and some government documents to LGBT people or even unmarried couples -- so long as they claim a religious objection. The ACLU is challenging portions of the law that permit discrimination against same-sex couples by arguing the law violates the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, and Bryant complained the civil rights group was \"bullying\" Christians in his state, reported Right Wing Watch. “I mean, they cherry-pick these issues,\" Bryant said during an appearance on a religious-right radio program. \"If they had any integrity at all, they would say, ‘We understand Mississippi is actually trying to make sure that Christians and people of other faiths are not discriminated against.’ It is a nondiscriminatory law. It prevents discrimination against simply that segment of the population that has a deeply held religious view about marriage.” The Republican governor whined that “dear friend Pat McCrory,” the governor of North Carolina, is also facing a political and corporate backlash after signing a similar anti-LGBT law. Bryant complained that Christians were facing discrimination from anyone who disagreed with their interpretation of the law as one that protected the rights of religious people to practice their faith. \"We’re criticized, we’re threatened, we’re bullied, we’re told by corporations that we’re doing the wrong thing?” Bryant said. “Where on earth have we come to simply say, ‘I do not wish my daughter in her school or in her university to have to have a male in the shower and in the dressing room and in the restrooms.’” Despite court challenges, directives from the U.S. Department of Justice and boycotts against their states, Bryant said he was certain he and his counterpart in North Carolina had significant support nationwide. “I think the rest of the nation is beginning to wake up and say, ‘What world do they think we’re living in? This is not Hollywood, this is not more liberal areas, this is America, where common sense still prevails,'\" Bryant said. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

        "articles": "CNN commentator Van Jones scolded counterpart Buck Sexton on Friday when Sexton tried to link the Black Lives Matter movement to Thursday night's mass shooting in Dallas, Media Matters reported. \"I think that what's actually fueling this is not some placard or what somebody said at some rally that nobody even heard, except they got on social media. What's fueling this is a sense that nobody cares and that the official pronouncements of our government show a level of indifference and a lack of concern,\" Jones said. \"And I think it's very, very important that we affirm our right to petition our government for redress of our grievances, and for that to be the main thing that we say and that these minority voices be marginalized. But I am tired of the entire movement being smeared by the extreme words of a few. It's not fair. It's not fair at all.\" Sexton argued that anti-police rhetoric had been escalated in a \"reckless\" fashion, saying that he had covered demonstrations where \"dozens, if not hundreds\" of attendees carried signs expressing anger of \"killer cops.\" \"There needs to also be a willingness to say that no, cops are not racist murderers and killers,\" he said. \"These are things that I've heard at protests myself, by the way. I've taken photos of placards, the notion that for example in Ferguson, justice was not done. The [Department of Justice] report, I guess, some people believe is still a lie, that Mike Brown was killed by an officer and an unjust system did nothing about it.\" He failed to mention, however, that suspected gunman Micah Johnson said he was not affiliated with any organization. Sexton also overlooked that, besides condemning the attack, organizers maintained a good relationship with local police heading into the demonstration. \"We have a problem with crazy people doing crazy things in this country because they can all get guns,\" Jones said. \"Dylann Roof went in there and shot up a whole church full of African-Americans, and he said he did it because of this racial propaganda that is growing by the so-called alt-right. But we don't talk about that. Somebody went in and shot up a whole Planned Parenthood saying it's because they're a Christian. We have crazy people grabbing guns and doing crazy things, but we should not blame, we should not give them the pass of saying that you're doing this because somebody held up a placard.\" Watch the discussion, as posted by Media Matters on Friday, below.

Brittany Stephens wasn't driving when the Baton Rouge police officer wrecked into their car at 94 mph, but police said she failed to properly secure the 1-year-old in her car seat, reported The Advocate. The 20-year-old Stephens told police she had buckled the child into her seat, but investigators said the girl's car seat was not secured and the straps were not correctly adjusted for her height. Officer Christopher Manuel struck a Nissan carrying four adults and four children about 8 p.m. on Oct. 12 while driving his Corvette at speeds approaching 100 mph, police said. The posted speed limit for that road was 50 mph. The Nissan driven by 18-year-old Breea Gross was turning left at a green light when Manuel slammed into the car, and all eight occupants were hospitalized. Seyaira Stephens later died from her injuries. Gross was cited for driving without a license, seat belt violation and three counts of child safety restraint violation. Janice Gross, 40, was cited for allowing an unlicensed driver to drive her vehicle and a seat belt violation, and Seth Eames, 23, was also cited for a seat belt violation. The 28-year-old Manuel, who was also hospitalized after the crash, was arrested Feb. 16 on one count of negligent homicide in the fatal crash. The officer will remain on paid administrative leave until an internal investigation wraps up, but the investigation will not begin until he recovers from his injuries and is released to work by a doctor.

        "articles": "At a meeting in March, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein told the assembled crowd that wireless Internet technology is dangerous for developing children. In the video, posted Monday by Patheos blogger Michael Stone, a woman in the audience said that she is a kindergarten teacher who is concerned about children being given devices with screens to learn from at a young age. Stein said that, yes, it's bad for growing kids to spend too much time glued to screens on TVs or computers. Too much non-human interaction has been shown to negatively affect children's cognition and their ability to socialize and communicate with others. \"And what about the wireless?\" the teacher asked. \"We should not be exposing, especially, kids' brains to that,\" Stein said. \"You know, we don't follow that issue in this country, but in Europe where they do, they have good precautions around wireless. Maybe not good enough, because it's very hard to study this stuff. We make guinea pigs out of whole populations and then we discover how many die.\" \"And this is, like, the paradigm for how healthcare works in this country,\" she said, \"and it's outrageous.\" There is no evidence that wireless signals are harmful to adults or children. The World Health Organization (WHO) said in May of 2006 that electromagnetic fields like wireless signals pose no risk to human health. \"(T)he body absorbs up to five times more of the signal from FM radio and television than from base stations,\" said WHO. \"From all evidence accumulated so far, no adverse short- or long-term health effects have been shown to occur from the RF (radiofrequency) signals produced by base stations. Since wireless networks produce generally lower RF signals than base stations, no adverse health effects are expected from exposure to them.\" Pollsters say there has been a mild uptick in interest in third party candidates since the political conventions. Disaffected Republicans are planning to cast votes for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, while Stein's Green party is hoping to scoop up supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Stein caught flack over the weekend for tweeting and then deleting a tweet saying that autism is in no way connected to vaccinations. The deletion of the message is being seen by many as a capitulation aimed at roping in supporters of the anti-vaccination or \"Anti-vaxx\" movement.

        "articles": "A new poll reveals a stunning political divide among Americans who are willing to protect themselves and their families against the deadly coronavirus versus those who believe conspiracy theories and lies propagated by malignant actors on Facebook, Fox News, or other far right wing media. In the latest Economist/YouGov poll, a whopping three out of every ten Republicans, Trump voters, and conservatives say they believe the U.S. Government is microchipping Americans through COVID-19 vaccine inoculations. There is no basis for the absolutely false and delirious claim. And while right wingers are not alone in this belief, only a small percentage of those identifying as Democrats, Biden voters, or liberals also claim it to be \"definitely\" or \"probably\" true. Overall, 20% – that's one in five Americans – believe the microchip lie. Within the 20% who believe that lie, half (51%) say they \"will not\" be vaccinated. 42% of Republicans and 35% of independents say they \"will not\" get vaccinated. Just 10% of Democrats share that same position. Overall that's 29% of U.S. adults, which means herd immunity is a long way away. The level of ignorance among those refusing to be vaccinated is tremendous. \"90% of those who reject vaccination fear possible side effects from the vaccine more than they fear COVID-19 itself,\" YouGov reports, noting that \"only 16% of them believe most of the new cases of COVID-19 are occurring among the unvaccinated.\" Reports across the country and from the federal government say 97% of COVID hospitalizations and 99% of COVID deaths are people who are unvaccinated. \"For the most part, they think the virus is spreading equally among the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, or they admit they just don't know. In contrast, more than three in four of the fully vaccinated know that new infections come mostly from those who have not yet received the vaccine.\" On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

        "articles": "The White House included a portion meant to undermine Congressional oversight when releasing the House Intelligence Committee's controversial memo alleging abuses at the FBI and Justice Department. \"Public release of classified information by unilateral action of the Legislative Branch is extremely rare and raises significant separation of powers concerns,\" White House counsel Don McGahn wrote in the cover letter addressed to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) when declassifying the memo last Friday. As Slate reported, this portion \"buried\" within McGahn's cover letter acts as a means to undermine Congress' ability to release information without the president, and suggests \"the House or Senate’s release of classified information to the public may happen only at the sufferance of the executive branch.\" Slate's Daniel Schuman broke McGahn's argument into four assertions: that the executive branch \"has primacy on national security matters\" and is tasked with providing classified information to Congress, that \"Congress’ power to release classified information is somehow weak\" and that the White House can override Congress when releasing classified information like the contents of Nunes' memo. \"This is a misreading of the law and a misunderstanding of Congress’ role as a co-equal branch of government with oversight powers over the executive,\" Schuman wrote. \"When read together, these assertions could be viewed as an attempt to pre-empt further releases of information by Congress, either by claiming such efforts are not legitimate (or somehow are unconstitutional) or by refusing to provide information demanded by Congress,\" he continued. \"These assertions are flat out wrong.\" Schuman went on to argue that Congress and the executive branch \"share responsibility on national security matters.\" Congress' power to release classified information separate from the White House was protected after Sen. Mike Gravel (D-AK), then the chairman of the Senate Public Works Committee, made a single-man motion to read the Pentagon Papers on the Senate floor in 1971. When he and his staff were tried before a grand jury for releasing that information, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 that they were protected by the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution.

As might be expected, since they advertised their intentions in advance , it went about as well as secession did beginning back in 1860. By the end of the day they had retreated to a parking garage for their own safety before probably heading out to a Cracker Barrel for a yee-haw victory party and then back to the halfway house before curfew started and their parole officers were notified. But out of chaos comes temporary order, and with it two perfect examples in the form of photos that illustrate what a sad and disgusting bunch of people these guys are who are standing up for white pride and heritage and the God-given strength they derive from their pure Aryan blood.

Georgia resident Cleveland Meredith Jr., an armed Capitol rioter who threatened to kill Nancy Pelosi, has now pleaded guilty to sending threatening communications and faces up to five years in jail. CNN reports that Meredith, who earlier this year told a judge that he was \"just having fun\" with his deadly threats, is due to be sentenced in December after his guilty plea. On Friday, writing for The New York Times, conservative National Review writer Kevin Williamson outlined how Republicans are still trying to execute former President Donald Trump's coup attempt — and how the Capitol attack on January 6 was only the beginning of the effort. \"As the Republican Party tries to make up its mind between wishing away the events of Jan. 6 or celebrating them, one thing should be clear to conservatives estranged from the party: We can't go home again,\" wrote Williamson. \"The attempted coup's foot soldiers have dug themselves in at state legislatures. For example, last week in Florida State Representative Anthony Sabatini introduced a draft of legislation that would require an audit of the 2020 general election in the state's largest (typically Democratic-heavy) counties, suggesting without basis that it may show that these areas cheated to inflate Joe Biden's vote count.\" As President Joe Biden and health professionals urge Americans to get vaccinated and wear masks, one chiropractor in Pennsylvania is signing exemption forms for anyone seeking to evade public health measures. Chiropractor John Dorobish of Cherry Tree Chiropractic in Uniontown was interviewed by WTAE-TV about the state's new mask mandates for schools. ",

Billy Graham, just days after Easter, took to Twitter to denigrate progressives in the wake of Tuesday's stunning upset that placed a progressive Democrat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. \"WI just lost a seat in its state Supreme Court to a progressive judge. In my opinion, if Christians had come out to vote, this seat wouldn't have been lost.

It had have included a large number of Wisconsin's Christians, since she won by a 12 point margin. \"Christians should be aware of candidates who call themselves progressive. Progressive is generally just a code word for someone who leans toward socialism, who does not believe in God, & who will likely vote against Godly principles that are so important to our nation,\" Graham also tweeted.

But a new report from The New York Times says that it was a case of mistaken identity that killed a U.S.-allied aid worker along with other innocent people. \"Military officials said they did not know the identity of the car's driver when the drone fired, but deemed him suspicious because of how they interpreted his activities that day, saying that he possibly visited an ISIS safe house and, at one point, loaded what they thought could be explosives into the car,\" the Times reports.

Speaking with Morning Joe regular Katty Kay, the MSNBC host took the president to task for lying to the public on a daily basis. \"The National Security Council, State Department, the Defense Intelligence Agency, Pentagon, CDC, HHS, the president himself with his presidential daily briefings -- we see all the steps on how they botched the testing,\" the Scarborough ranted. \"How the FDA, one of the leaders of the FDA said to the CDC in late February, 'If you were a private industry, we would shut you down, you botched this so badly.'\" \"Here we are in April; on April the 13th, we're talking about missteps from what they knew in early January,\" he continued. \"Donald Trump still has no plan for testing, no clue for testing. You could look back, he's lied time and time again. He lied to the CDC on March 6th, saying, 'Any American who wants a test can have a test.' April 13th, people still can't get the test.\" \"Every day it seems they come up and lie about the new testing plan when, in fact, Donald Trump has done nothing to make testing a national effort in an expansive way,\" he added. \"Even his biggest supporters are quietly concerned in the Senate and the House about the lack of testing that America still has.\" Watch below: On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

        "articles": "A Tennessee woman who backs President Donald Trump credits God and the Republican health care bill -- which hasn't been voted into law -- for her family's dramatically lower insurance costs. Charla McComic's son recently lost his job, and his health-insurance premium dropped from $567 per month to $88, which she described as \"a blessing from God\" and a gift from the new president, reported the Washington Post. The 52-year-old former first-grade teacher thinks the change is due to tax credits that would be offered under the so-called \"Trumpcare\" law, if and when it's approved by Congress and signed into law -- but the price drop is actually a feature of former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Workers who lose their jobs and employer-based health care coverage may enroll in Obamacare, which offers coverage based on income or possibly Medicaid for those with little or no income -- like McComic's son. McComic, who attended Trump's rally this week in Nashville with four family members, told the Post she's not worried that her 33-year-old son or 3-year-old granddaughter will lose their Medicaid coverage under the GOP plan. “So far, everything’s been positive, from what I can tell,” she told the newspaper. “I just hope that more and more people and children get covered under this new health-care plan.” McComic, who campaigned for Trump with some relatives by forming a motorcade and driving through their hometown shouting his name, said she's never trusted a president as much as the real estate developer and former reality TV star. “We said: ‘Who else would we do this for, besides Trump?’” McComic said. “We agreed on the Lord. We would stand here for the Lord, but that’s about it.” On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

        "articles": "According to the fantastical, anti-Semitic conspiracy theory known as QAnon, a secret cabal of liberals, Hollywood celebrities and foreign governments is kidnapping and sexually abusing children before eating them. This ritual grants members of the evil global elite special powers they use to manipulate the world and oppress (white) Christians and other groups. In QAnon's alternate reality, a shadowy figure known as \"Q\" — who has been notably silent of late — sends out secret \"drops\" containing messages, clues and orders to true believers. As explained by Q, Donald Trump and his MAGA allies have led a resistance movement against the Deep State, preparing for a great cataclysm called \"the Storm,\" in which Trump will seize full power (or, latterly, return to power) and all will be revealed. Ultimately, QAnon is an updated version of the infamous anti-Semitic libel \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\" a conspiracy theory which has existed since the early 20th century and played a central role in the Holocaust. QAnon is also much more than a mere conspiracy theory. It is a cult that has destroyed families and relationships. It is a con that lures in the weak-minded and the vulnerable. It is a political force with ambiguous but substantial influence within the neofascist Republican Party. It could also be described as a live-action roleplaying game for lonely and socially alienated adults who are desperate for a sense of agency, meaning and community in their lives. QAnon also has elements of religion. Adrienne LaFrance writes at the Atlantic: As a new religion, the emergence of QAnon coincides with and has fueled the Republican Party and Trump movement's embrace of right-wing terrorism and other political violence. Terrorism and extremism expert Colin Clarke told the Independent how white right-wing Christian evangelicals are being radicalized by the QAnon conspiracy theory into committing acts of terrorism: In an effort to understand how white Christian evangelicals are being radicalized into terrorism and other forms of extremism, I recently spoke with Robert Jones, CEO and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). Jones is also a leading scholar on religion, politics and culture. His essays and other commentaries have been featured by the Atlantic, CNN, NPR, The New York Times, The Washington Post and the New York Times. Jones is also the author of \"White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity\" and \"The End of White Christian America.\" In this conversation, Jones explains how Trump's insurrection and the Capitol attack should also be understood as expressions of white supremacy and Christian nationalist violence. He also details how white evangelicals actually believe that they are being oppressed and have become victims in America — false beliefs which make them very susceptible to conspiracy theories such as QAnon, political extremism and, in the worst-case scenario terrorism and political violence such as we witnessed on Jan. 6. Jones also explores why white evangelicals are so loyal to Donald Trump and his political cult and what that reveals about American politics and society. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length. How do we explain white Christian evangelicals' enduring devotion to Donald Trump, no matter what he does? He can encourage terrorism, attempt a coup, incite a lethal attack on the Capitol and engage in all manner of apparent crimes, and they still love him. Polling shows that even after the insurrection on Jan. 6, there are still supermajorities of white evangelicals reporting that they hold favorable views of Donald Trump. There was a majority of evangelicals saying before the 2020 election that they saw President Trump as being called by God to be president. That has been true throughout Trump's presidency. One of the most remarkable things about white evangelicals in terms of Donald Trump is how little their favorability toward him have changed. Two impeachments, major scandals —including sex scandals involving sordid matters such as having affairs and paying hush money — none of that really seems to have shaken their favorability towards Trump. It's been very stable, somewhere between two-thirds and 80% favorable of Trump during the entire four years he was president. There are two likely reasons for this. The slogan \"Make America Great Again\" was supposed to be changed to \"Keep America Great\" [for 2020]. The Trump campaign very quickly pivoted away from that and just stayed with the old slogan. The power of Trump's appeal is a backward nostalgia which involves going back to a previous time when white Christians had more power in the United States. \"Making America Great Again\" signals to that desire to \"restore\" that state of affairs. During Trump's campaign speeches, and even on Jan. 6, Trump would say things such as, \"If you're not ready to stand up and fight, America as you know it will be over. You're going to lose your country.\" But who is the \"your\"? Who is the \"our\"? Trump is appealing to a white Christian base. What he is communicating is, \"I'm the person who's going to help you continue to hold onto your sense of ownership of this country.\" For Trump's base of voters that is what it is all about. His appeal is not about policies. It's certainly not about abortion or same-sex marriage. The appeal is based around a single issue. Looking at the Jan, 6 attack, what did you see when you analyzed that crowd of insurrectionists? It was remarkable to me. There were Bibles, there were crosses, there were Bible verses on signs. There were flags that said things such as, \"Trump is my president, Jesus is my savior.\" There were shofars being blown, not by Jews but by Christians, who were convinced they were fulfilling some prophecy by bringing Trump into office. Perhaps the image that stuck with me the most is that there was a fair amount of attention being paid to the Confederate battle flag being marched through the Capitol building. But what did not get enough attention is that there was also the Christian flag. Many people may not be familiar with it. That flag was being marched right into the House chamber along with the Confederate flag. They were all there. There was also a big white cross being carried up the steps along with all those other banners. I am not quite sure that the American people as a whole really understand what the coexistence of all those symbols really means. The insurrectionists are telling us who they are. They very deliberately chose those symbols. They wore them on their clothes. These were white supremacists. These were Christians. Those two groups were not fighting each other. They were marching side by side. The Ku Klux Klan is a white Christian right-wing terrorist organization. Many of the white supremacists and other terrorists who attacked the Capitol likely identity as \"Christians.\" Why the tendency to parse \"Christianity\" and \"white supremacy\" as somehow being distinct from one another? I guarantee you that if all those people had been carrying Muslim symbols, the narrative would be that they were radical Islamic terrorists. America has such a long history of being dominated by Christianity that many people are reluctant to really see the connections between white supremacy and Christianity as part of American culture. But you are exactly right. The Ku Klux Klan targeted not just African Americans but also Jews and Catholics, because they considered the United States to be a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant country. What do we know about the relationship between the QAnon conspiracy theory and white Christian evangelicals? Paul Djupe, who is a political scientist at Denison University, did a recent study looking at the overlap between QAnon and evangelicals. He found that more than half of white evangelicals agree with the basic beliefs of QAnon. It has made deep inroads. But that's really not that surprising. When you look at the structure of QAnon, it is essentially a loose collection of pseudo-Christian ideas that have been floating around evangelical Christianity for decades. If we go back to the \"Left Behind\" novels from the 2000s, the building blocks of QAnon are right there. For example, there is a big battle of good versus evil, a worldwide conspiracy to control the government, and the job of Christians is to be local prayer warriors who are allied with angels in a literal fight against their enemies, who are working with the devil. QAnon has many of those same things. There is supposed to be a great \"Storm\" that will sweep away all the illegitimate holders of power and bring in a figure who is essentially the messiah. Donald Trump has been overlaid onto that \"Left Behind\" narrative. Combating the influence of QAnon is a really serious challenge for white Christian pastors. What about the overlaps between QAnon and anti-Semitism? In many ways, QAnon really goes back to the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\" Such ideas have been around for quite some time. They are certainly not new. QAnon is just their current manifestation. It is very important for pastors to make those connections for parishioners so that they can see the dangerous historical lineage that they are continuing with QAnon. Why do white evangelicals somehow feel under siege or disadvantaged in the United States? In reality, they are oppressing other groups of people -- white evangelicals are not \"victims\" in America. I am from the South and understand how the idea of being under siege runs deep here. That is especially true in the culture of Southern evangelicalism. It goes way back to the Lost Cause mentality of the Civil War and as a backlash to the civil rights movement. A proclivity to be the \"victim\" runs deep in terms of theology here as well. This is particularly true in white evangelical circles. Both Republicans and white evangelicals believe that they face more discrimination than other groups such as African Americans and gays and lesbians. That trend has been documented in the polling data and other research for several years. That sense of being under siege has become even stronger during the Trump years. It was certainly there before that, but it's become even stronger. What do we know about why white evangelicals gravitate to QAnon more than other groups of Christians? Both groups believe in invisible people who tell them things and share secrets only with them. One would think that Christians who are so oriented would be joining QAnon across the board. By way of comparison, both white evangelicals and African American Christians share many similar theological beliefs. However, it is white evangelicals who are much more likely to be connected to QAnon and similar conspiracy theories. I do not believe that the answer lies in a common belief in something invisible. QAnon and other like beliefs are ultimately self-serving. At the end of the day, QAnon preserves white power. We passed from being a majority white Christian country to one that is no longer majority white Christian. That happened proximate to Obama's time in office. With him, the first black president, there was a very vivid symbol of demographic change. That really has set off a desperate struggle where many white Christians are now in a bid to hold onto their group's power. Weird things happen when you get desperate. Those white Americans are reaching for almost anything that will tell them that they are still the most important group in the country, that they still own the country, the country was created for their benefit. In many ways the bedrock of their worldview is crumbling. PRRI has completed new polling and research on questions of \"religious freedom.\" What have you learned? One of the clearest findings is when we ask people the direct question, \"Do you think religious liberty in America is under threat\". Most Americans say no. But we have a very loud minority, four in 10 Americans, telling us that religious liberty is being threatened today. Again, it is white evangelicals who really stand out as a group, with more than 70% of them saying religious liberty is being threatened. No other religious group in the United States comes anywhere near that. It really is just this one very loud minority group of white evangelicals. Part of the explanation lies in the fact that if you go back to 2008, they were 21% of the population. Today they're only 15% of the population. As white evangelicals have started shrinking as a group, they are getting louder and more desperate. When a group feels existentially threatened, they are more prone to engage in terrorism and other violence. They literally believe they are in a life-and-death battle. White evangelical Protestants are at a very dangerous place in their history today. They have been accustomed to being in the majority, as part of the mainstream of American culture. They find themselves increasingly out of step with the country in terms of their beliefs and their attitudes. Their children and grandchildren are disaffiliating from white evangelical churches. It is a shrinking movement. The danger then becomes that if part of your worldview depends on the belief that America is a Christian nation — and not just a Christian nation but really a Protestant nation — and moreover that your group are rightful inheritors of that country, and you add in leaders telling you that your country is being unfairly taken away from you, it all becomes a very dangerous powder keg. Such beliefs can lead to extraordinary responses. I believe that the extremes of this view are violent. We should take that very seriously.

        "articles": "Sean Hannity finds himself in a professionally problematic situation after he was outed in federal court as the mystery third client of President Donald Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen -- but he could potentially be in deeper trouble. The Fox News broadcaster neglected to inform viewers of his personal ties to Cohen despite repeatedly discussing the attorney and the FBI raid on his home and office, which likely includes evidence related to Hannity's discussions with him. It's not clear what evidence relating to Hannity could have been turned up by the search warrant, or whether those documents or recordings would be of any interest to investigators. But former National Security analyst John Schindler and others have been warning for months that Hannity has helped the president spread Russian propaganda through his nightly Fox News broadcasts and daily syndicated radio program. Schindler claims the Fox News broadcaster has been under counterintelligence investigation for his links to the Kremlin, which appear to run through WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. \"We need to ask questions about Hannity’s relationship with the Kremlin, considering his track record of pushing rancid Russian disinformation on his Fox News program,\" Schindler said. \"Hannity is a propagandist, not a journalist, by his own admission, but if he has served as a witting conduit for lies crafted by Russian spies, Fox News needs to explain why they are airing Kremlin Active Measures aimed at the American public and calling it 'news.'\" \"Intelligence Community friends have told me that Sean Hannity has been under counterintelligence investigation for some time, based on his clandestine ties to Moscow,\" he added. \"Now we know why.\" Hannity played a key role in promoting a conspiracy theory about slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, whose family has sued Fox News over a since-retracted May 2017 article posted on the network's website. Fox News Malia Zimmerman and frequent Fox News guest Ed Butowsky reported that Rich had leaked thousands of internal DNC emails that U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies believe were stolen by Russian hackers. Schindler says the conspiracy theory originated just days after Rich's murder on the shadowy conspiracy website Sorcha Faal -- which claimed the 27-year-old was assassinated by a \"hit team\" linked to Hillary Clinton. The website claimed its source was Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, and Schindler noted this \"classic Kremlin disinformation\" campaign was quickly picked up by Trump allies such as Hannity, Assange and Republican activist Roger Stone. The Rich family's lawsuit claims Trump himself reviewed drafts of the Fox News story last year before it was broadcast and published online. WikiLeaks, which dumped the stolen emails online during the 2016 campaign, offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich's killer -- and Assange reportedly has been in contact with Hannity, Stone and Donald Trump Jr. Stone appeared on the InfoWars radio show -- where host Alex Jones also promoted the Rich conspiracy -- the same day he sent an email claiming to have dined with Assange, and predicted \"devastating\" disclosures against the Clinton Foundation. No evidence has turned up yet that Hannity and Assange were in contact during the campaign, but the WikiLeaks founder reached out to a parody Twitter account for the Fox News broadcaster that suggests the two men may have been in contact before -- and Hannity has invited Assange to host his radio program. Texas writer Dell Gilliam set up the phony account in January after Hannity's legitimate account was briefly deleted after cryptically tweeting the phrase “Form Submission 1649 | #Hannity.” Assange contacted the account, apparently believing it was the broadcaster, and offered to set up a meeting over \"other channels\" to send \"some news about Warner.\" About a week later, Fox News broke into its evening programming to report on text messages between Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the top Democrat on the Senate's Russia investigation, and a lobbyist linked to a Russian oligarch. The texts had been reviewed months earlier by Republicans, who saw nothing suspicious about them, and Ed Henry, the Fox News reporter who broke the story, insisted WikiLeaks and Hannity played no role in his reporting. Hannity hyped the report on his radio program, hours before Henry's report came out, and Trump tweeted an attack on Warner's credibility hours after it aired. \"Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a 'paper trail' on a 'private' meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary,” he tweeted. Hannity also played a leading role in hyping a misleading memo written by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) intended to discredit the special counsel probe, which was also promoted by Russian bots on social media. Did the Cyber Ninjas botch another attempt to recount Maricopa County's 2020 presidential ballots—an attempt that, so far, has escaped wide media coverage? It appears, at the very least, that a contract signed on July 28 by the Cyber Ninjas—the lead contractor in the Arizona Senate Republicans' election review—and Dr. V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai, a Boston-based technologist and unsuccessful GOP U.S. Senate candidate, indicated that all 2020 election results would be tallied by August—and that deadline has now been missed. On Friday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a federal judge is refusing to release Jacob Chansley, an infamous January 6 Capitol rioter known as the \"QAnon Shaman,\" to St. Louis ahead of his sentencing. \"U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth's order was made public Friday,\" reported Robert Patrick. \"Chansley was required to show by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community, and Lamberth said he failed. Although Chansley's lawyer, Albert Watkins, had arranged for a place for Chansley to stay, with mental health treatment, Watkins failed to show how anyone would prevent Chansley from fleeing the area. Watkins' plan also does not mitigate the possibility that Chansley's supporters would provide him money to flee, the judge said.\" The 9/11 terrorist attacks did not just result in major changes to the U.S. government, but also the press corps. With President George W. Bush banging the drums of war, much of the national press rallied around the flag as Congress voted to invade Afghanistan, pass the Patriot Act, invade Iraq and create the Department of Homeland Security.

On Friday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a federal judge is refusing to release Jacob Chansley, an infamous January 6 Capitol rioter known as the \"QAnon Shaman,\" to St. Louis ahead of his sentencing. \"U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth's order was made public Friday,\" reported Robert Patrick. \"Chansley was required to show by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community, and Lamberth said he failed. Although Chansley's lawyer, Albert Watkins, had arranged for a place for Chansley to stay, with mental health treatment, Watkins failed to show how anyone would prevent Chansley from fleeing the area. Watkins' plan also does not mitigate the possibility that Chansley's supporters would provide him money to flee, the judge said.\" ",

        "articles": "Republican strategist Evan Siegfried told MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle that he thinks Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh should withdraw from consideration, saying a \"slap in the face\" to women voters risks \"retribution\" at the polls. Kavanaugh faces accusations of attempted sexual assault dating back to the early 1980s. Remarking that \"there are plenty of other conservative judges out there\" who would \"excite the conservative base\", Siegfried nonetheless admitted the allegations of sexual misconduct rang true. \"That's why it's so painful to watch this happen to Brett Kavanaugh,\" he said. \"And to Dr. Ford, who I am starting to believe, more and more, the more I think about it.\" Siegfried also pointed out the \"political risk\" for the GOP. \"If we try and fast track this and move through this as fast as possible and put Brett Kavanaugh in the court,\" he said. \"A decent size of the population [will be] questioning the legitimacy of the rulings coming from the Supreme Court and the character of somebody on the Supreme Court, just like they had with Clarence Thomas.\" While Ruhle doubted that the allegations would flip any Republican votes, Siegfried named a few Senators he believed might jump ship, including Bob Corker, Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, and Tim Scott. The real issue, he argued, was the \"political calculus\". \"We're already accused of having a war on women, and you've seen how well we govern, which is not well at all,\" he said. \"It reinforces the narrative. When you've seen women come out to the polls and register in historic numbers since President Trump was elected, this could be a slap in the face and ultimately feed the anger and retribution that women are going to bring in November.\" Watch the video below. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G. Newell, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:43 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced. A judge since 2016 and before that Caroline County's top prosecutor for more than a decade, he was to be taken into custody on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child, prosecutors said,\" reported Justin Fenton. \"A boy that Newell took on a hunting trip on Hoopers Island discovered a hidden camera in the bathroom on July 23, and his parents reported it to police, which The Sun reported last week.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Friday criticized President Joe Biden for ending the war in Afghanistan, which dragged on for two decades.

        "articles": "Modern Western conservatism came into being in response to the American and French Revolutions. Like liberalism, it has waxed and waned as a political movement during the decades since. According to some historians, the origins of contemporary American conservatism can be traced to the 1920s, only to fade during the New Deal. Its subsequent resuscitation is probably best dated to 1950s and 1960s. Some key historical signposts then and after include the following: The founding of the National Review magazine in 1955, and the publication of Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged in 1957. White Southern reaction to the Civil Rights revolution of the 1950s and 1960s, which ultimately led to majority-white affiliation with the Republican Party. The revived political activism of conservative Evangelicals during that same period, which would include – along with the Catholic Church – opposition to legalized abortion. The Republican Party’s nomination of “Mr. Conservative,” Barry Goldwater, as its presidential standard-bearer in 1964, followed four years later by Richard Nixon’s “Southern strategy.” The creation and articulation of the Vietnam War stab-in-the back legend by President Nixon and pro-war hawks, which blamed America’s miring and ultimate defeat in Vietnam on liberals, Democrats, the antiwar movement, and the press. The ascension of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in 1980. The launching of Rush Limbaugh’s national radio talk show in the 1988 and of Fox News TV Network in 1996. The ascension of Newt Gingrich to the US House of Representatives speakership (1995-1999). The emergence of the Tea Party in 2008. The Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010. The forming of the so-called House Freedom Caucus in 2015, and the surfacing of Donald Trump’s 30-something percent “base” of supporters in 2016. But what is political “conservatism”? And are self-styled conservatives really conservative?Merriam-Webster defines conservative” as “tending or disposed to maintain existing views, conditions, or institutions.” Similarly, the Oxford English Dictionary defines a conservative as “a person who conserves or preserves something; an adherent of traditional values, ideas, and institutions; an opponent of social and political change.” Wicktionary pithily defines the conservative as “a person who favors maintenance of the status quo.” These definitions are unhelpful and misleading. Self-proclaimed political and social conservatives are not necessarily inclined to support or maintain the “traditional” social order – that is, long-standing majority views, conditions, institutions, or legislation. These include government regulation of corporations, banks, and Wall Street, progressive income taxes, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, public education, civil rights, voting rights, environmental regulations, and public-lands conservation. Self-identified conservatives also oppose other traditional institutions, practices, and measures, such as the United Nations, international standards for the treatment of prisoners of war, labor unions, collective bargaining, fair labor standards, and, for some, public fluoridation of water. The measures conservatives oppose were legislated, created, or practiced 50 to 100 or more years ago. Nor do many self-proclaimed conservatives embrace the 242 year-old, traditional proposition in the Declaration of Independence that “all men are created equal” – i.e., “men” as in “all humans,” including people of color and women – as Americans later discovered through war, political activism, and moral evolution. Moreover, so-called conservative Constitutional “originalists,” such as the late Justice Antony Scalia, were and are ever ready to reinterpret the US Constitution to serve their prejudices or benefactors. This was the case, for example, in the 5-4 conservative majority decision in the District of Columbia v. Heller(2008) decision, which, along with other decisions, applied a loose interpretation of the Second Amendment by asserting the individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, while also limiting the state’s power to regulate arms. Although many conservatives express opposition to “big government,” their anti-statist stances have varied widely, depending on the issue at hand. When it serves their interests, they do not hesitate to use the apparatus of the Federal government to achieve their ends – just as Senators and Representatives from Southern slave states did when enacting and enforcing the Federal Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Nor are self-proclaimed conservatives always opponents of social and political change if overturning current social and political norms serves their own beliefs and interests. Abraham Lincoln made this point in February 1860 in his address at Cooper Institute, when he asked: “What is conservatism?” In answer, he pointed out that self-styled Southern conservatives “spit upon” the old policy toward slavery in order to “insist on substituting something new.” The present-day conservative Dinesh D’Souza defended such conservative behavior, arguing that “if the existing society is hostile to conservative beliefs . . . , it is foolish for a conservative to attempt to conserve that culture . . . . The conservative must . . . . be philosophically conservative but temperamentally radical.” To be sure, there are factions of conservatives: the far Right (e.g., American Nazis, fascists, and Breitbart owners, writers, and readers), paleocons, neocons, the religious right, libertarians, Tea Party populists, the Freedom Caucus, “moderate” Republicans, certain corporate elites, NRA executives and many NRA members – along with other factions. Their views and goals vary on specific issues. Nonetheless, somewhere in their minds, they share a common conservative core of ideas, notions, and emotions. In his book, The Reactionary Mind, political scientist Corey Robin argues that there is a fundamental “reactionary thrust” in conservatism – namely, the conviction that “some are fit to rule others.” Quoting George Nash, he adds: conservatism is “resistance to certain forces perceived to be leftist, revolutionary, and profoundly subversive of what conservatives at the time deemed worth cherishing, defending and perhaps dying for” – and which challenges their perceived self-interest. Conservatism in all its forms is oppositional and reactionary at its core. As Karl Mannheim argued, they oppose “other ways of life and thought that appears on the scene.” It would be better for all if self-styled conservatives heeded the advice of the early nineteenth-century English churchman and academic, Arthur Stanley, who observed that “conservatism . . . destroys what it loves because it will not mend it.” Jeffrey P. Kimball, Miami University professor emeritus, has written articles and books on several topics, including ideology. His latest book, co-authored with William Burr, is Nixon’s Nuclear Specter: The Secret Alert of 1969, Madman Diplomacy, and the Vietnam War (2015). On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G. Newell, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:43 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced.

        "articles": "Donald Trump's dark complaints about a \"rigged\" election were lifted from Bernie Sanders -- and then used as weapons to undermine the potential presidency of the first woman to ever serve as head of the executive branch. New York Times columnist Charles Blow faults Sanders for eroding voter trust during his primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, and which Trump has turned into another variation of his \"birther\" conspiracy theories intended to undermine the first black president, Barack Obama. Blow said blogs such as Vox and FiveThirtyEight worked to debunk Sanders' claims, saying some Democratic Party rules worked against him while others worked in his favor, but the Vermont independent \"simply lost because he got fewer votes.\" \"But still, the 'rigged' idea stuck,\" Blow said. As Trump sinks in the polls in the weeks ahead of Election Day, the Republican presidential nominee has twisted Sanders' anti-establishment motif to suggest the results won't be legitimate -- and many voters agree. \"At this point, it’s not even clear if Trump would graciously concede if he lost,\" Blow said. \"Indeed, grace may be beyond his grasp.\" Blow said he thinks the Democratic presidential nominee is likely rising in the polls as \"a repudiation of Trump’s abhorrence,\" rather than enthusiasm for a Clinton presidency -- and he blames her male rivals for undercutting \"this immensely qualified woman.\" \"I think it’s fair to say our electoral processes aren’t perfect,\" Blow said. \"But they’ve never been. Nor has any candidate been perfect. So why must those imperfections be nullifying at the very moment that a woman is on the verge of victory? Clinton is a woman beating men at their own game. Deal with it.\" MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and a group of his allies met with Donald Trump over dinner on Aug. 13 — the date Lindell had previously promised would bring Trump's \"reinstatement\" as president — sources have told Salon. The previously-unreported meeting occurred shortly after the bedding tycoon's \"cyber symposium\" in South Dakota, which failed to produce anything close to proof of election fraud. Josh Merritt, a former member of Lindell's \"red team\" at the South Dakota gathering, told Salon that the meeting occurred at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach on the evening of Aug. 13. According to Merritt, New Mexico State University law professor David K. Clements, a Lindell associate and \"election truther,\" talked about the potential Trump meeting ahead of time, during the cyber symposium. \"David said he was trying to get on as a lawyer for 45,\" Merritt said adding that Clements saw Lindell's relationship with Trump as a way to gain access to the inner circles of TrumpWorld. An anti-mask extremist targeting Torrance, California Unified School District school board president Betty Lieu, who just happens to be married to sitting Democratic U.S. Congressman Ted Lieu, repeatedly screamed \"look at me!\" as she spoke against masks at Tuesday's meeting. \"Mrs. Lieu, I would like you to please look at me. You've been looking at your computer. Mrs. Lieu. Look at me! Mrs. Lieu look at me!\" the speaker, introduced in the original video as Erin DiMaggio, repeatedly screamed, in video posted to social media (below). \"Do you feel that? What you have demonstrated is that mentality of power over instead of power with. What you are demonstrating is that you do not care about us, what you, you are still not looking at me Mrs. Lieu. Mrs. Lieu. Thank you. I see you. Our eyes are the seat of our soul, our breath is from the spirit, and what you are doing is you are all damaging and destroying our children's spiritual, emotional, physical well being. Mrs. Lieu, you again, are not looking at me.\" Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) on Friday accused President Joe Biden of trying to make Americans forget about the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks by pushing out new rules intended to get more Americans vaccinated against COVID-19. While appearing on Fox News, Ernst accused the Biden administration of \"leading by coercion\" when it comes to vaccines, and she then added that \"this is a diversion away from 9/11, away from the 20th anniversary, and away from the debacle that was his Afghanistan withdrawal.\" ",

        "articles": "On Sunday, former federal prosecutor and MSNBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner highlighted why President Donald Trump's Attorney General William Barr made a grave mistake in waiting for House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) to subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, rather than moving quickly to release it on his own terms. \"There's been a lot of talk about whether Chairman Nadler was right to pursue subpoenaing the report,\" said Kirschner. \"And I actually think there's one important reason that he is right, and that it was wise to subpoena the report. If Barr was going to say, 'you know what, I'll give you a copy on my own without a subpoena,' well then Barr would have been free to redact away. It could have been a redaction jamboree before he voluntarily provided a copy of the report to Chairman Nadler and his committee.\" \"However, once a subpoena has been issued for that report, then I think there's going to be a much more exacting standard with respect to every single redaction made by Barr,\" said Kirschner. \"Now, if he's redacting something that he shouldn't be, if he's redacting something solely to protect the president, there is an argument that that is actually an obstruction of that judicial committee's work in subpoenaing what is a very important document to their responsibilities.\" \"So I think it was smart that they're going down the subpoena road, and let's see if Barr complies,\" Kirschner concluded.

        "articles": "CNN's Jake Tapper reported Monday that when the president was visiting the border last week, he attempted to close down the El Paso, Texas port of entry at the border. Tapper also said that President Donald Trump told his team that all border patrol agents should be told not to allow any entrances into the United States. To make matters worse, Trump wants to go back to putting children in cages and separating families because he believes it served as a deterrent to anyone coming to the United States. As a point of fact, it didn't. Border crossings have increased under Trump's policies. \"He just wants to separate families,\" one White House official told Tapper. Sunday night, Trump fired Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who would get into fights with the president over what he could legally do. According to reports Sunday, Trump would fly into a rage if he was told something was against the law. \"Nielsen proposed an alternative plan that would slow down entries at legal ports, but she argued, if you close all of the ports of entry, all you're going to achieve is end legal trade and travel,\" Tapper reported Monday. \"That's not going to end illegal immigration, she argued to the president. The migrants will just go between ports.\" According to two people in the room at the time, Trump shouted: \"I don't care!\" \"Ultimately, it seems chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was able to talk the president out of closing the port of El Paso and the other ports,\" Tapper said. \"The president, however, was insistent that his administration begin taking another action, just denying asylum seekers entry into the United States.\" Secretary Nielsen attempted to explain to the president how asylum laws actually work, but he seemed either disinterested or unable to understand. \"Behind the scenes, according to two witnesses, president Trump told border agents to simply stop letting migrants in,\" Tapper said. \"Tell them, 'We don't have the capacity,' he said. If judges give you trouble, say, 'Sorry, judge, I can't do it, we don't have the room.'\" But after the president left, Homeland Security officials and leaders at Border Patrol told the officers and agents that they couldn't do that legally and doing so would bring personal liability onto themselves. \"You have to follow the law, the border agents were told,\" Tapper said. \"Senior administration officials also tell me that in the last four months or so, president Trump has been pushing his administration to enforce a stricter and more widespread family separation policy. Not just the original policy, started by attorney general Jeff Sessions and undone by the president once it was criticized, that was a policy of prosecuting individuals crossing the border illegally between legal ports of entry and that substituted a separation of parents from their children.\" Instead, Trump wants an \"expanded version\" of the policy. He wants families to be split apart even if they come in legally.

        "articles": "In the United States, there is one set of rules for rich people (especially if they are also white) and another set for everyone else. That unjust and anti-democratic system is reflected across American society. The country's wealth and income inequality is so extreme (especially the race-wealth gap) that it more closely resembles that of a Third World autocracy than one of the world's richest countries and a \"leading democracy.\" There is the \"legal\" theft. The county's laws are literally written by the rich and the powerful. In turn, those laws represent their interests and goals over and above those of the average American. Political scientists have actually shown that America's elected officials on the national level are largely not responsive to the demands and needs of ordinary people. The tax code is one such example of how the rich and powerful have created a system that rewards their class with subsidies, tax breaks, write-offs and other benefits to such a grotesque extreme that some of the country's richest individuals, families, and corporations pay no taxes at all — and in many cases actually receive \"refunds\" from the American people. \"Job creators\" and \"too big to fail\" are convenient shorthand to describe rent-seeking behavior and the ways many of the country's plutocrats and other members of the elite classes are economic and social parasites. Even allowing for the fact that the nation's laws are written to serve the interests of the rich and powerful, new reporting has shown that the top 1 percent of income earners still hide or otherwise do not report at least 20 percent of their income. That theft is on a massive scale: It is estimated to cost the American people $1.4 trillion over a 10-year period. The FBI also reports that so-called white collar crime costs the American economy hundreds of billions a year. This should not be a surprise, but is still shocking: The IRS is much more likely to audit or otherwise investigate poor and working-class people than the rich. Of course, the rich and powerful have found a way to profit from the misery, death and destruction caused by the COVID pandemic. The Institute for Policy Studies estimates that the world's richest people have increased their wealth — measured in the trillions of dollars — by at least 50 percent during the coronavirus plague year. In a pre-election article for the New Republic, Ankush Khardori explained how the Age of Trump and its many disasters created an ideal environment for white collar criminals: Ultimately, the Trump regime and its allies provide an almost ideal example of how rich and powerful people can abuse and break the law, enrich themselves by doing it, and face few if any consequences for their anti-social behavior. Jennifer Taub is a legal advocate, as well as professor of law at the Western New England University School of Law. Her most recent book is \"Big Dirty Money: The Shocking Injustice and Unseen Cost of White Collar Crime.\" Her previous book was \"Other People's Houses: How Decades of Bailouts, Captive Regulators, and Toxic Bankers Made Home Mortgages a Thrilling Business.\" In this conversation, Taub explains how America's two-tiered legal system encourages financial and other crimes by the very rich. She also explores how members of that group learn that behavior throughout their lives and then normalize it. In addition, Taub profiles two cases, the opioid epidemic and the 2008 mortgage crisis and financial crash, that typify the widespread harm caused by white collar crime. Taub also reflects on a basic but powerful counterfactual: if Donald Trump had been properly punished by the law and imprisoned for the many financial and other crimes he committed earlier in life, the horror and pain caused by his presidency would likely have been avoided. There are these hope-peddlers and others in the news media and elsewhere who keep suggesting that Donald Trump may go to jail or suffer some other severe punishments for his obvious crimes. When I hear such fables, I respond with a laugh. At worst, Trump will pay a fine. Members of his cabal who may face charges will likely do the same thing and plead out. There may be civil settlements. But none of the high-level Trumpists are going to prison. Rich people do not throw other rich people in jail. The powerful rarely if ever hold each other accountable. Will Donald Trump ever go to prison? Wearing my lawyer hat, I am supposed to speak in a slow, sober tone and say that before there is even a discussion about whether Donald Trump spends any time in prison there has to be a process and a trial, and then after that, if the prosecution proves the case, then, yes, that day will come. My more honest and yet cynical answer is that there will not be enough consequences for Trump, given what he has done over his lifetime to this country, his ongoing harmful and dangerous behavior. Even if they \"lock him up.\" This is not the movie The Wizard of Oz where someone is going to pour water on Donald Trump and he is just going to melt. Ivanka and Jared and the other people in Trump's orbit and inner circle are not going to melt into a big pool of water on the floor either — and suddenly there will no longer be an oligarchy in America, or suddenly the billionaires will disappear who own most of the wealth in this country. That is not going to happen. We need to move forward. Bringing Trump to justice is not enough. What is Donald Trump an example of? Donald Trump is a perfect example of what is extruded from this unfair and sometimes corrupt system in America. Trump is somebody who is white, wealthy and well-connected and who used questionable behavior and sometimes criminal tactics to gain and sustain wealth and power. What makes Trump unusual, in my opinion, is how high in society he climbed. Trump has been involved in potentially illegal activity for decades and was able to get away with making civil settlements. Had Trump been held accountable before he ran for office back in 2015, he would have spent time in a federal prison instead of in the Oval Office. Trump is an example of the danger that we face as a society when we let people get by, because it's easier just to settle than to prosecute. For many of the civil settlements involving Trump and his businesses there could have been criminal punishments. It is just easier for the government to bring civil cases and settle with people sometimes than to charge them criminally. That is the same thing that happened after the financial meltdown of 2008, where we have examples of senior bank executives who settled their cases with regulators and then avoided criminal charges. As a class of people, how are the rich different from everyone else? How does their world work? Consider a rich white kid. It is a cradle-to-grave system. People from the white suburbs go to rehab, they don't go to jail. The cops tell you, \"Turn down the music and go home.\" They don't escort you to the police station. That system of protections for the wealthy continues throughout their lives. What does that cradle-to-grave system look like? Leona Helmsley once said that \"taxes are for the little people.\" Spin that out more to \"Laws are for the little people.\" The problem with Helmsley is she said the quiet part out loud and was too mean and too greedy and so she went to a Club Fed prison for 18 months. She was the exception, not the rule. There's a saying accountants tell their well-to-do clients: Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered. Yet for every example set, there is plenty of space for the rich and white, especially rich white men, to make mistakes and be forgiven time and again. That is also a space to be predatory and have one's behavior covered up and otherwise ignored. And it's not just about getting away with crime, it's also about getting by without all that much effort or merit. It's the ability to be of average ambition or average motivation or average performance and still be assured a safe place to live. To still be assured a decent standard of living and the respect of society and the ability to go about your life even as an adult making mistakes. They know they won't end up living on the street because of their mistakes. It is astonishing to see how different the world of the rich is from how everyone else lives. How does America's two-tiered legal system work in practice? We have a double standard in the American criminal justice system that reflects and perpetuates inequality. Cutting legal corners is a tool for advancement only available to the already affluent. The wealthy not only increase their power by evading punishment, but also benefit from a criminal justice system that incarcerates those with lower social status who also attempt to use crime to get ahead. Scale that up to a multinational corporate enterprise dodging the law, and the disparities are even more stark. Corporations guilty of felonies enter into deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements with the government and reoffend again and again. Yet high-level executives are rarely prosecuted. Even when the exception proves the rule, and a high-status individual is prosecuted and convicted, the double standard carries into sentencing, where statutory guidelines require judges to give serious weight to a convicted felon's past contributions to their community. Such leniency fails to acknowledge that preemptively spreading around ill-gotten funds to charities is a con artist's trick to gain public trust, manipulate community do-gooders and inoculate themselves. Forgiveness is often reserved for the fortunate. The federal prison system allows wealthy offenders better conditions than ordinary convicts, with low-security camp settings for the former and dangerous caged conditions for the latter. Often, when top-shelf felons — like 1980s junk bond king Michael Milken, 1990s lifestyle guru Martha Stewart and recently released Enron CEO Jeff Skilling — complete a prison sentence, they rejoin high society with sufficient funds to rehabilitate themselves and relaunch their careers with little lasting stigma. In 2019, the actress Lori Loughlin, indicted in the college admissions scandal known as Operation Varsity Blues, reportedly sought to hire a crisis management firm that might fashion her redemption in Martha Stewart style. In contrast, the impact of incarceration on the poor and working class can be irreversible for both the defendant and their children for years, if not generations, to come. What does justice look like in America for the rich and the poor, the elites versus everyone else? We are all entrenched in a legal system that helps the most powerful protect their private property and contract rights. And that same system subordinates those with less resources and power. The same system and same courts set up to oversee those types of private disputes also handle criminal matters with a similar mindset. Criminal laws as written, interpreted and enforced tend to punish far more severely those who take property from the wealthy, and let off the hook the giant enterprises and wealthy individuals who take things of value, including lives, from the middle class and poor. To me, equal justice would mean that prosecutors would have a \"collateral consequences\" standard applied to ordinary people, not just business organizations, before they prosecute. We would have treatment available and not prison for drug offenders. We would also eliminate cash bail and only impose pre-trial detention on those who are a flight risk or a danger to their community or themselves. In your book, you detail how the opioid crisis is an example of criminality and lack of accountability in America for the very rich. Can you share some of those details? Purdue Pharma shows the failures on the part of the Department of Justice in terms of enforcement and repeat offending. This is a company that was prosecuted previously. In 2007, the company did plead guilty to a felony for misbranding OxyContin under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Three senior executives — none of them Sackler family members —pleaded guilty to misdemeanors. But the company continued on. A decade after the 2007 guilty plea, the civil lawsuits brought by the states and private individuals begin. At the end of the Trump regime in 2020, Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty again as part of a DOJ settlement with the company. This time, in addition to pleading guilty to conspiracy to violate the the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act and to defraud the United States, Purdue also pled to violating federal anti-kickback laws.There were also civil charges against the Sackler family. But where are the criminal charges against them or other real people? This is an example of how the failure to hold individuals accountable for the crimes of the organizations they are running or participating in does not create any kind of deterrence. It is not real accountability. It completely undermines the public trust. The Sackler family made billions of dollars. They are one of the wealthiest families in America. They amassed a reported $14 billion fortune and joined the ranks of America's 20 wealthiest families. Meanwhile, more than 232,000 fellow Americans died from prescription opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2018. All these poor and working-class people died from overdoses. The message is that some lives and families matter, and others do not. The 2008 financial collapse is another example of how the rich are not held accountable for their crimes. The nonpartisan reports on the financial crisis show that at every link of the toxic mortgage supply chain there was actual criminality. There are many who say things like, \"Well, it was perfectly legal!\" That is not true. There were loan originators who were encouraging people to lie on their forms. They were using whiteout to change people's income. There was fraud throughout the process from top to bottom. Decades of deregulation helped to fuel this. As a society we do not have to live this way. We can create a kind of shared prosperity. We can create a system where we don't have financial bubbles, or if we do have bubbles and market downturns, the people with the least do not have to suffer the most. Likewise, the people with the most do not have to gain more wealth. This is happening right now with the so-called K-shaped \"recovery.\" I am grateful that the Biden administration seems to understand this problem and has responded with the COVID relief stimulus and hopefully the infrastructure bill gets passed as well. There was a recent announcement that the very rich, the top 1 percent, hide 20 percent of their income or find ways not to report it. By some estimates that may be $1 trillion dollars or more over a 10-year period that is not collected in taxes. What are the practical implications of that thievery for the average American? For example, when people are not paying what is legally required of them it means that someone else is not getting help recovering from their drug addictions, so instead they turn to crime. It means that the roads and bridges are not safe. It means that kids do not have access to preschool. Because the rich are not paying the taxes they owe and otherwise hiding income, it means that they are a de facto criminal class. The 1 percent are literally becoming wealthier and more powerful from criminal behavior. They use their influence to change the laws so that they pay fewer taxes, and this includes underfunding the IRS. What are the tax investigators and others looking for with Trump and his inner circle? What does \"criminality\" in that context look like? In Trump's case, apparently both the Manhattan DA and the New York state Attorney General are looking at tax fraud under state law. More generally, the reason why tax fraud can be so prevalent is that there is a voluntary system of compliance for the most wealthy. Ordinary people who work for a living have taxes withheld by their employers, paycheck by paycheck. The very wealthy, however, earn money in all sorts of ways that they are supposed to self-report including investment income and consulting arrangements and sales of assets like artwork or jewelry for cash. While in some cases investment firms will report to the IRS on behalf of customers, banks do not need to report incoming and outgoing payments, so there is a great deal of unreported income. So, then it's up to the wealthy to tell the IRS truthfully and to assess losses that they can subtract from their income truthfully. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G. Newell, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:43 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced. A judge since 2016 and before that Caroline County's top prosecutor for more than a decade, he was to be taken into custody on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child, prosecutors said,\" reported Justin Fenton. \"A boy that Newell took on a hunting trip on Hoopers Island discovered a hidden camera in the bathroom on July 23, and his parents reported it to police, which The Sun reported last week.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Friday criticized President Joe Biden for ending the war in Afghanistan, which dragged on for two decades. Before taking over Strom Thurmond's seat in the U.S. Senate, Graham voted for the war in Afghanistan as a member of the House of Representatives. The United States may soon hit yet another major milestone in its efforts to vaccinate its citizens against the novel coronavirus. Reuters reports that American regulators could authorize Pfizer's vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 as soon as the end of October. ",

        "articles": "New polls show that Donald Trump's base is beginning to turn against him — and it may be related to his continual insults on their intelligence. \"A raft of new polls show that some of the most hard-core Trumpsters are starting to get a clue,\" nonfiction author Timothy Eagen wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Friday, adding that the revelation is akin to \"discovering that climate change is not a hoax when your town is under water, and all your commander in chief can do is throw you a roll of paper towels.\" Though there's plenty of reasons for the president's supporters to have begun their about-face, Eagen noted that it's likely they \"feel he finally crossed a line: He’s now insulting them.\" \"It didn’t go over well in Alabama that Trump reportedly called his ’Bama-bred attorney general, Jeff Sessions, 'a dumb Southerner' and ridiculed his accent,\" the author observed of the account from Bob Woodward's new book \"Fear: The Trump White House. Though Trump denied the insult ever took place, Eagen pointed out that it's not the first time he or his associates reportedly have made fun of the poor, rural and uneducated. \"Trump has used the regional dis before, calling the family of another ex-wife, Marla Maples, 'dumb Southerners' and 'hillbillies,' as one reporter recalled,\" he wrote. \"Last week, the longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone trashed Sessions as an 'insubordinate hillbilly' — expressing a double dose of hick hatred.\" The proof, Eagen noted, is in the polls. He noted that according to a Quinnipiac poll released this week, a plurality of \"non-college-educated whites\" wish Congress would rein Trump in. He's also \"down 14 points among the 'poorly educated'\" per a CNN poll, the writer noted. Read the entire column via the Times.

        "urls": "http://www.rawstory.com/2015/05/here-are-7-things-people-who-say-theyre-fiscally-conservative-but-socially-liberal-dont-understand/",
        "articles": "\"Well, I'm conservative, but I'm not one of those racist, homophobic, dripping-with-hate Tea Party bigots! I'm pro-choice! I'm pro-same-sex-marriage! I'm not a racist! I just want lower taxes, and smaller government, and less government regulation of business. I'm fiscally conservative, and socially liberal.\" How many liberals and progressives have heard this? It's ridiculously common. Hell, even David Koch of the Koch brothers has said, \"I’m a conservative on economic matters and I’m a social liberal.\" And it's wrong. W-R-O-N-G Wrong. You can't separate fiscal issues from social issues. They're deeply intertwined. They affect each other. Economic issues often are social issues. And conservative fiscal policies do enormous social harm. That's true even for the mildest, most generous version of \"fiscal conservatism\" -- low taxes, small government, reduced regulation, a free market. These policies perpetuate human rights abuses. They make life harder for people who already have hard lives. Even if the people supporting these policies don't intend this, the policies are racist, sexist, classist (obviously), ableist, homophobic, transphobic, and otherwise socially retrograde. In many ways, they do more harm than so-called \"social policies\" that are supposedly separate from economic ones. Here are seven reasons that \"fiscally conservative, socially liberal\" is nonsense. 1: Poverty, and the cycle of poverty. This is the big one. Poverty is a social issue. The cycle of poverty -- the ways that poverty itself makes it harder to get out of poverty, the ways that poverty can be a permanent trap lasting for generations -- is a social issue, and a human rights issue. If you're poor, there's about a two in three chance that you're going to stay poor for at least a year, about a two in three chance that if you do pull out of poverty you'll be poor again within five years -- and about a two in three chance that your children are going to be poor. Among other things: Being poor makes it much harder to get education or job training that would help you get higher-paying work. Even if you can afford job training or it's available for free -- if you have more than one job, or if your work is menial and exhausting, or if both of those are true (often the case if you're poor), there's a good chance you won't have the time or energy to get that training, or to look for higher-paying work. Being poor typically means you can't afford to lose your job -- which means you can't afford to unionize, or otherwise push back against your wages and working conditions. It means that a temporary crisis -- sickness or injury, job loss, death in the family -- can destroy your life: you have no cushion, nobody you know has a cushion, a month or two without income and you're totally screwed. If you do lose your job, or if you're disabled, the labyrinthine bureaucracy of unemployment and disability benefits is exhausting: if you do manage to navigate it, it can deplete your ability to do much of anything else to improve your life -- and if you can't navigate it, that's very likely going to tank your life. Also, ironically, being poor is expensive. You can't buy high-quality items that last longer and are a bargain in the long run. You can't buy in bulk. You sure as hell can't buy a house: depending on where you live, monthly mortgage payments might be lower than the rent you're paying, but you can't afford a down payment, and chances are a bank won't give you a mortgage anyway. You can't afford the time or money to take care of your health -- which means you're more likely to get sick, which is expensive. If you don't have a bank account (which many poor people don't), you have to pay high fees at check-cashing joints. If you run into a temporary cash crisis, you have to borrow from price-gouging payday-advance joints. If your car breaks down and you can't afford to repair or replace it, it can mean unemployment. If you can't afford a car at all, you're severely limited in what jobs you can take in the first place -- a limitation that's even more severe when public transportation is wildly inadequate. If you're poor, you may have to move a lot -- and that's expensive. These aren't universally true for all poor people -- but way too many of them are true, for way too many people. Second chances, once considered a hallmark of American culture and identity, have become a luxury. One small mistake -- or no mistake at all, simply the mistake of being born poor -- can trap you there forever. Plus, being poor doesn't just mean you're likely to stay poor. It means that if you have children, they're more likely to stay poor. It means you're less able to give your children the things they need to flourish -- both in easily-measurable tangibles like good nutrition, and less-easily-measurable qualities like a sense of stability. The effect of poverty on children -- literally on their brains, on their ability to literally function -- is not subtle, and it lasts into adulthood. Poverty's effect on adults is appalling enough. Its effect on children is an outrage. And in case you hadn't noticed, poverty -- including the cycle of poverty and the effect of poverty on children -- disproportionately affects African Americans, Hispanics, other people of color, women, trans people, disabled people, and other marginalized groups. So what does this have to do with fiscal policy? Well, duh. Poverty is perpetuated or alleviated, worsened or improved, by fiscal policy. That's not the only thing affecting poverty, but it's one of the biggest things. To list just a few of the most obvious examples of very direct influence: Tax policy. Minimum wage. Funding of public schools and universities. Unionization rights. Banking and lending laws. Labor laws. Funding of public transportation. Public health care. Unemployment benefits. Disability benefits. Welfare policy. Public assistance that doesn't penalize people for having savings. Child care. Having a functioning infrastructure, having economic policies that support labor, having a tax system that doesn't steal from the poor to give to the rich, having a social safety net -- a real safety net, not one that just barely keeps people from starving to death but one that actually lets people get on their feet and function -- makes a difference. When these systems are working, and are working well, it's easier for people to get out of poverty. When they're not, it's difficult to impossible. And I haven't even gotten into the fiscal policy of so-called \"free\" trade, and all the ways it feeds poverty both in the U.S. and around the world. (I'll get to that in a bit.) Fiscal policy affects poverty. And in the United States, \"fiscally conservative\" means supporting fiscal policies that perpetuate poverty. \"Fiscally conservative\" means slashing support systems that help the poor, lowering taxes for the rich, cutting corners for big business, and screwing labor -- policies that both worsen poverty and make it even more of an inescapable trap. 2: Domestic violence, workplace harassment, and other abuse. See above, re: cycle of poverty. If someone is being beaten by their partner, harassed or assaulted at work, abused by their parents -- and if they're poor, and if there's fuck-all for a social safety net -- it's a hell of a lot harder for them to leave. What's more, the stress of poverty itself -- especially inescapable, entrapped poverty -- contributes to violence and abuse. And you know who gets disproportionately targeted with domestic violence and workplace harassment? Women. Especially women of color. And LGBT folks -- especially trans women of color, and LGBT kids and teenagers. Do you care about racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynist violence? Then quit undercutting the social safety net. A solid safety net -- a safety net that isn't made of tissue paper, and that doesn't require the people in it to constantly scramble just to stay there, much less to climb out -- isn't going to magically eliminate this violence and harassment. But it sure makes it easier for people to escape it. 3: Disenfranchisement. There's a cycle that in some ways is even uglier than the cycle of poverty -- because it blocks people from changing the policies that keep the cycle of poverty going. I'm talking about the cycle of disenfranchisement. I'm talking about the myriad ways that the super-rich control the political process -- and in controlling the political process, both make themselves richer and give themselves even more control over the political process. Purging voter rolls. Cutting polling place hours. Cutting back on early voting -- especially in poor districts. Voter ID laws. Roadblocks to voter registration -- noticeably aimed at people likely to vote progressive. Questionable-at-best voter fraud detection software, which -- by some wild coincidence -- tends to flag names that are common among minorities. Eliminating Election Day registration. Restricting voter registration drives. Gerrymandering -- creating voting districts with the purpose of skewing elections in your favor. Voter suppression is a real thing in the United States. And these policies are set in place by the super-rich -- or, to be more precise, by the government officials who are buddies with the super-rich and are beholden to them. These policies are not set in place to reduce voter fraud: voter fraud is extremely rare in the U.S., to the point of being almost non-existent. The policies are set in place to make voting harder for people who would vote conservative plutocrats out of office. If you're skeptical about whether this is actually that deliberate, whether these policies really are written by plutocratic villains cackling over how they took even more power from the already disempowered -- remember Pennsylvania Republican House Leader Mike Turzai, who actually said, in words, \"Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done.\" Remember former Florida Republican chairman Jim Greer, who actually said, in words, \"We’ve got to cut down on early voting because early voting is not good for us.\" Remember the now-former North Carolina Republican official Don Yelton, who actually said, in words, that voter restrictions including voter ID were \"going to kick Democrats in the butt.\" Remember the Texas Republican attorney general and candidate for governor Greg Abbott, who actually said, in words, that \"their redistricting decisions were designed to increase the Republican Party’s electoral prospects at the expense of the Democrats.\" Remember Doug Preisse, Republican chair of Franklin County (Ohio’s second-largest county) who actually said (well, wrote), in words, that Ohio Republicans were pushing hard to limit early voting because \"I guess I really actually feel we shouldn’t contort the voting process to accommodate the urban -- read African-American -- voter-turnout machine.\" (And no, the \"read African-American\" clarification isn't mine -- it's his.) Remember... oh, you get the idea. Disenfranchisement is not some accidental side effect of Republican-sponsored voting restrictions. Disenfranchisement is the entirely intentional point. And on top of that, you've got campaign finance laws saying that corporations are people, too -- \"people\" with just as much right as you or I to donate millions of dollars to candidates who'll write laws helping them out. When you've got fiscal policies that enrich the already rich -- such as regressive tax policies, deregulation of businesses, deregulation of the financial industry -- and you combine them with campaign finance laws that have essentially legalized bribery, you get a recipe for a cycle of disenfranchisement. The more that rich people control the political process, the richer they get -- and the richer they get, the more they control the political process. 4: Racist policing. There's a whole lot going on with racist policing in the United States. Obviously. But a non-trivial chunk of it is fiscal policy. Ferguson shone a spotlight on this, but it isn't just in Ferguson -- it's all over the country. In cities and counties and towns across the United States, the government is funded, in large part, by tickets and fines for municipal violations -- and by the meta-system of interest, penalties, surcharges, and fees on those tickets and fines, which commonly turn into a never-ending debt amounting to many, many times the original fine itself. This is, for all intents and purposes, a tax. It's a tax on poor people. It's a tax on poor people for being poor, for not having a hundred dollars in their bank account that they can drop at a moment's notice on a traffic ticket. And it's a tax that disproportionately targets black and brown people. When combined with the deeply ingrained culture of racism in many many many police forces -- a police culture that hammers black and brown people for the crime of existing -- it is a tax on black and brown people, purely for being black or brown. But Loki forbid we raise actual taxes. Remember the fiscal conservative mantra: \"Low taxes good! High taxes bad!\" High taxes are bad -- unless we don't call them a tax. If we call it a penalty or a fine, that's just peachy. And if it's disproportionately levied by a racist police force on poor black people, who have little visibility or power and are being systematically disenfranchised -- that's even better. What are they going to do about it? And who's going to care? It's not as if black lives matter. What's more: You know some of the programs that have been proposed to reduce racist policing? Programs like automatic video monitoring of police encounters? An independent federal agency to investigate and discipline local policing, to supplement or replace ineffective, corrupt, or non-existent self-policing? Those take money. Money that comes from taxes. Money that makes government a little bit bigger. Fiscal conservatism -- the reflexive cry of \"Lower taxes! Smaller government!\" -- contributes to racist policing. Even if you, personally, oppose racist policing, supporting fiscal conservatism makes you part of the problem. 5: Drug policy and prison policy. Four words: The new Jim Crow. Drug war policies in the United States -- including sentencing policies, probation policies, which drugs are criminalized and how severely, laws banning felons convicted on drug charges from voting, and more -- have pretty much zero effect on reducing the harm that can be done by drug abuse. They don't reduce drug use, they don't reduce drug addiction, they don't reduce overdoses, they don't reduce accidents or violence that can be triggered by drug abuse. If anything, these policies make all of this worse. But they do have one powerful effect: Current drug policies in the United States are very, very good at creating and perpetuating a permanent black and brown underclass. They are very good at creating a permanent class of underpaid, disenfranchised, disempowered servants, sentenced to do shit work at low wages for white people, for the rest of their lives. This is not a bug. This is a feature. You don't have to be a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist to see how current U.S. drug policy benefits the super-rich and super-powerful. It is a perfect example of a \"social issue\" with powerful ripple effects into the economy. And that's not even getting into the issue of how the wealthy might benefit from super-cheap prison labor, labor that borders so closely on slavery it's hard to distinguish it. So people who are well-served by the current economy are strongly motivated to keep drug policy firmly in place. Plus, two more words: Privatized prisons. Privatized prisons mean prisons run by people who have no interest in reducing the prison population -- people who actually benefit from a high crime rate, a high recidivism rate, severe sentencing policies, severe probation policies, and other treats that keep the prison population high. It's as if we had privatized fire departments, who got paid more the more fires they put out -- and thus had every incentive, not to improve fire prevention techniques and policies and education, but to gut them. Privatization of prisons is a conservative fiscal policy. It's a policy based on the conservative ideal of low taxes, small government, and the supposedly miraculous power of the free market to make any system more efficient. And it's a policy with a powerful social effect -- the effect of doing tremendous harm. It's true that there are some conservatives advocating for criminal justice reform, including drug policy reform, on the grounds that the current system isn't cost-effective. The problem with this, as Drug Policy Alliance Deputy State Director Laura Thomas points out: When you base policy decisions entirely on whether they're cost-effective, the bottom line will always take priority. Injustice, racism, corruption, abuse -- all of these can stay firmly in place. Human rights, and the human cost of these policies? Meh. Who cares -- as long as we can cut government spending? 6: Deregulation. This one is really straightforward. Deregulation of business is a conservative fiscal policy. And it has a devastating effect on marginalized people. Do I need to remind anyone of what happened when the banking and financial industries were deregulated? Do I need to remind anyone of who was most hurt by those disasters? Overwhelmingly poor people, working-class people, and people of color. But this isn't just about banking and finance. Deregulation of environmental standards, workplace safety standards, utilities, transportation, media -- all of these have the entirely unsurprising effect of making things better for the people who own the businesses, and worse for the people who patronize them and work for them. Contrary to the fiscal conservative myth, an unregulated free market does not result in exceptional businesses fiercely competing for the best workers and lavishly serving the public. It results in monopoly. It results in businesses with the unofficial slogan, \"We Don't Care -- We Don't Have To.\" It results in 500-pound gorillas, sleeping anywhere they want. 7: \"Free\" trade. This one is really straightforward. So-called \"free\" trade policies have a horrible effect on human rights, both in the United States and overseas. They let corporations hire labor in countries where labor laws -- laws about minimum wage, workplace safety, working hours, child labor -- are weak to nonexistent. They let corporations hire labor in countries where they can pay children as young as five years old less than a dollar a day, to work 12 or even 16 hours a day, in grossly unsafe workplaces and grueling working conditions that make Dickensian London look like a socialist Utopia. And again -- this is not a bug. This is a feature. This is the whole damn point of \"free\" trade: by reducing labor costs to practically nothing, it provides cheap consumer products to American consumers, and it funnels huge profits to already obscenely rich corporations. It also decimates blue-collar employment in the United States -- and it feeds human rights abuses around the world. Thank you, fiscal conservatism! *** This list is far from complete. But I think you get the idea. Now. There are conservatives who will insist that this isn't what \"fiscally conservative\" means. They're not inherently opposed to government spending, they say. They're just opposed to ineffective and wasteful government spending. Bullshit. Do they really think progressives are in favor of wasteful and ineffective government? Do they think we're saying, \"Thumbs up to ineffective government spending! Let's pour our government's resources down a rat hole! Let's spend our tax money giving every citizen a solid-gold tuba and a lifetime subscription to Cigar Aficionado!\" This is an idealized, self-serving definition of \"fiscally conservative,\" defined by conservatives to make their position seem reasonable. It does not describe fiscal conservatism as it actually plays out in the United States. The reality of fiscal conservatism in the United States is not cautious, evidence-based attention to which government programs do and don't work. If that were ever true in some misty nostalgic past, it hasn't been true for a long, long time. The reality of fiscal conservatism in the United States means slashing government programs, even when they've been shown to work. The reality means decimating government regulations, even when they've been shown to improve people's lives. The reality means cutting the safety net to ribbons, and letting big businesses do pretty much whatever they want. You can say all you want that modern conservatism in the United States isn't what you, personally, mean by conservatism. But hanging on to some ideal of \"conservatism\" as a model of sensible-but-compassionate frugality that's being betrayed by the Koch Brothers and the Tea Party -- it's like hanging onto some ideal of Republicanism as the party of abolition and Lincoln. And it lends credibility to the idea that conservatism is reasonable, if only people would do it right. If you care about marginalized people -- if you care about the oppression of women, LGBT people, disabled people, African Americans and Hispanics and other people of color -- you need to do more than go to same-sex weddings and listen to hip-hop. You need to support economic policies that make marginalized people's lives better. You need to oppose economic policies that perpetuate human rights abuses and make marginalized people's lives suck. And that means not being a fiscal conservative.

Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University, came forward as the author of the letter detailing an alleged encounter with Kavanaugh in the early 1980s. Ford told The Washington Post that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her at a high school party. This article was originally published at Salon Prominent conservatives and right-wing pundits have been up in arms over the revelation. They've mostly been enraged that this might impede his nomination to the Supreme Court.

Ford said that when she attempted to scream, Kavanaugh put his hands over her mouth to silence her.

        "articles": "Roanoke County Supervisor Al Bedrosian was interrupted by a breast cancer survivor as he was pushing to defund Planned Parenthood at a recent press conference in Virginia. According to The Roanoke Times, Bedrosian had been on a \"crusade\" to defund the United Way since a conservative group released deceptively edited videos of Planned Parenthood employees speaking about fetal tissue donations. Roanoke County's United Way helps fund non-abortive education provided by local Planned Parenthood chapters. The county does not provide funding to United Way or Planned Parenthood. But it does participate in a fundraising campaign, allowing government employees to give to United Way. “Let’s make everybody happy,” Bedrosian told a group of anti-abortion activists in front of the county administration building. “Those that want to support Planned Parenthood, go for it. Do it. We’ll continue to pray on our side that we get out of this business of killing babies, but you can do it if you want. That’s freedom in America. But to actually enhance, facilitate or enable it through county government is where I have a problem.” A woman who was identified as Leigh Anne Woods by WDBJ walked up the podium and took her shirt off as Bedrosian was speaking. \"You have a problem because they perform abortions, look at everything else they do, they save lives!\" Woods said. “It’s more than birth control,” she insisted. “It’s more than abortion. They save lives.” Woods told WDBJ that she wanted to show the county supervisor the scars from the mastectomy she had just weeks earlier, and she credited Planned Parenthood for saving her life. This week, Bedrosian's colleagues accused him of orchestrating a \"bullying\" campaign by asking anti-abortion supporters to send angry emails to government officials until his demands were met. Roanoke City Manager Chris Morrill said that some of the emails alleged that Planned Parenthood “is doing the work of Satan.” Watch the video below from WDBJ. video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player In a 2018 interview with Lisa Luckett, whose husband Teddy worked and died in the World Trade Center building on September 11, 2001, Luckett told Salon one memory she never wants to forget from that horrific day was the \"beauty,\" \"grace,\" \"compassion,\" and \"incredible strength of the human spirit\" that followed. \"I never expected people to show up for me,\" Luckett said.

Ohio Republican Senate candidate Josh Mandel flipped out on the Anti-Defamation League on Friday after the organization criticized him for equating vaccination mandates with the Nazi gestapo. The drama started when the ADL called on Mandel to apologize for his campaign video in which he urged followers to stand up to President Joe Biden's \"gestapo\" policy of pushing companies to either ensure their workers are vaccinated or to give them weekly tests.

        "articles": "Apple is only the latest big global American corporation to use foreign tax shelters to avoiding paying its fair share of U.S. taxes. It’s just another form of corporate desertion. Corporations are deserting America by hiding their profits abroad or even shifting their corporate headquarters to another nation because they want lower taxes abroad. And some politicians say the only way to stop these desertions is to reduce corporate tax rates in the U.S. so they won’t leave. Wrong. If we start trying to match lower corporate tax rates around the world, there’s no end to it. Instead, the President should use his executive power to end the financial incentives that encourage this type of corporate desertion. President Obama has already begun, but there is much left that could be done. In addition, corporation that desert America by sheltering a large portion of their profits abroad or moving their headquarters to another country should no longer be entitled to the advantages of being American. 1. They shouldn’t be allowed to influence the U.S. government. They shouldn’t be allowed to contribute to U.S. political campaigns, or lobby Congress, or participate in U.S. government agency rule-making proceedings. And they no longer have the right to sue foreign companies in U.S. courts for acts committed outside the United States. 2. They shouldn’t be entitled to generous government contracts. “Buy American” provisions of the law should be applied to them. 3. Their assets around the world shouldn’t any longer be protected by the U.S. government. If their factories and equipment are expropriated somewhere around the world, they shouldn’t expect the United States to negotiate or threaten sanctions, or use our armed forces to protect their investments. And if their intellectual property – patents, trademarks, trade names, copyrights – are disregarded, that’s their problem too. Don’t expect any help from us. In fact, their interests should be of no concern to the U.S. government – in trade negotiations, climate negotiations, international treaties reconciling American law with the laws of other countries, or international disputes over access to resources. They don’t get to be represented by the U.S. government because they’re no longer American. It’s simple logic. If corporations want to desert America in order to pay less in taxes, that’s their business. But they should no longer have the benefits that come with being American.

        "articles": "Former President Donald Trump is now retaining legal counsel to defend him in a lawsuit filed against him by Capitol police officers James Blassingame and Sidney Hemby. The Daily Beast reports that Trump is retaining attorney Jesse Binnall, who is also representing the former president against a civil suit filed by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), in the suit filed by the Capitol officers. The lawsuit filed by the two officers directly blames Trump for actions that \"inflamed, encouraged, incited, directed, and aided and abetted\" an angry mob that stormed the United States Capitol building and left five people dead. The two officers in the lawsuit allege that they \"suffered injuries to their heads, necks, and backs from assaults by the rioters and continue to struggle with the emotional toll of having been overwhelmed by the rioting mob that day,\" the Daily Beast reports. Although Binnall isn't as well known of a Trump attorney as Rudy Giuliani or Sidney Powell, he is a veteran of the multiple legal battles that took place during Trump's administration. As the Daily Beast reported earlier this year, Binnall \"previously represented former Trump national security advisor Mike Flynn, alongside attorney Sidney Powell, after prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI about his communications with Russia's ambassador to the U.S.,\" and more recently \"filed a lawsuit in Nevada on behalf of the Trump campaign which sought to overturn President Joe Biden's electoral victory there.\" Referring to it as a \"righteous strike,\" the U.S. Military carried out the last known drone strike in Afghanistan on Aug. 29, claiming they were targeting an ISIS suicide bomber who posed an imminent threat to U.S. troops. But a new report from The New York Times says that it was a case of mistaken identity that killed a U.S.-allied aid worker along with other innocent people. \"Military officials said they did not know the identity of the car's driver when the drone fired, but deemed him suspicious because of how they interpreted his activities that day, saying that he possibly visited an ISIS safe house and, at one point, loaded what they thought could be explosives into the car,\" the Times reports.

Appearing on The O'Reilly Factor, Trump spokesperson Katrina Pearson hammered at the other candidates while covering for her boss who, in a recent debate, was stumped when asked the country's nuclear strike capability known as the \"nuclear triad.\" “What good does it do to have a good nuclear triad if you’re afraid to use it?” Pierson asked. \"And that's where we are today and we need to fix these problems. Not just complaining and name-calling about who started this and who started that.\" Pierson's comments stunned conservative columnist and Desert Storm veteran Kurt Schlichter, who got into a contentious argument with Pierson over her boss's ignorance on nuclear matters. “The point of the nuclear triad is to be afraid to use the damn thing. You want to scare the hell out of the other side,” Schlichter excitedly yelled. “And frankly, my side will be more scared if Donald Trump gets his finger on the button.” In a previous television appearance, Pierson defended Trump's much-criticized proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country, telling a horrified S.E.

Appearing on CNN Wednesday, Haberman outlined how Trump has come to believe the delusional theories of both Powell and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, both of whom have falsely claimed to have definitively proof of the 2020 election being \"stolen\" from Trump. \"Is Trump regurgitating what he's hearing from Lindell and what he's hearing Sidney Powell say? I think that's what this is,\" she said. She also said that Trump has blown off warnings from allies to stop believing Powell. \"He's been told by a number of advisers that he has to stop focusing on this,\" she said. \"It is part of why he is so focused on these quote-unquote audits in Arizona -- and why he's been trying to get them in other states -- because he thinks they're going to overturn the election.\" Haberman also predicted that Trump's delusional claims about being reinstated will only grow louder if his legal peril increases. \"I expect it to get more intense the more he is under investigation by the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general in New York,\" she said.

        "articles": "Donald Trump is achieving two feats simultaneously that, based on conventional wisdom, should be impossible. His poll numbers are skyrocketing while his support among Hispanics - a group that makes up 6-8% of the GOP voting base - has bottomed out to unprecedented lows. Roughly 65% of Hispanics have an unfavorable view of Trump, a staggering 40 points higher than the second to least popular,Ted Cruz at 24%. While Hispanics are not historically a sizable bloc of GOP voters, this radically inverse correlation speaks to a broader, troubling trend that begs for explanation. The excess, previously untapped surge, as it turns out, appears to be coming largely from white nationalist and xenophobic elements. Despite the dozens of trend pieces over the past few years about shifting voting demographics, the harsh reality remains that the United States is still an exceedingly white place. And those white people, especially white men, still wield the overwhelming amount of power. White men comprise 31% of the population but make up 60% of the gun owners. White men make up 31% of the population but 65% of elected officials. There are 155 million voting age non-Hispanic whites in America. There were a total of 129 million votes cast in 2012, including 65 million for Obama. Put simply: there’s not only a lot of white voters in this country, there’s a lot of untapped white voters and they make up more than enough of the population to secure their own majority voting bloc for decades to come. By selling out the 6-8% of Hispanic voters entirely, Trump has picked up a comparable (and likely much more) number of fringe whites. Given that whites still make up about three-quarters of the voters in the nation and will likely be the clear majority for decades to come, there is every reason to believe that whites will have a real say in who governs. Indeed the white population’s growing allegiance to the Republican Party points to a very different short term future — one that might more likely be highlighted by Republican victory than by Democratic dominance. The grim reality is the GOP doesn’t need minority votes to win. Trump knows it. The Republican party knows it. And the media knows it but is too busy feigning outrage - and holding to the myth of “courting Hispanics” - to point out this political reality. Indeed, the GOP doesn’t need a “big tent”, it just needs a bigger tent - preferably one armed to the teeth with racists and subsidized by billionaires. More and more, this dynamic is on display among Trump’s white nationalists supporters, who, over the past couple of weeks have been coming out of the closet -- showing up at rallies and lending their passionate support. Alone, these incidents could be written-off as nut-picking, but when added up - and coupled with Trumps inability to speak out against these excesses (if not sometimes embracing them) - it's a serious trend that should frightened anyone concerned for the future of already teetering republic. Here are ten of recent highlights: 1. “[Trump’s critics are] living on the pieces of silver that they get from their Jewish paymasters so that they can preside over our extermination, our disposition, and our ultimate disappearance from the face of the earth.” Don Advo. Neo-nazi, host of Stormfront Radio 2. “Hopefully, he’s going to sit there and say, ‘When I become elected president, what we’re going to do is we’re going to make the border a vacation spot, it’s going to cost you $25 for a permit, and then you get $50 for every confirmed kill [of an undocumented worker]. That’d be one nice thing.” JimSherota, 53 Trump supporter in Alabama 3. “He’s refreshing...Trump, on a gut level, kind of senses that this is about demographics, ultimately. We’re moving into a new America.” Richard Spencer, National Policy Institute a White Nationalist think tank the SPLC calls a “suit and tie KKK”. 4. “Certainly [Trump is] the best of the lot… I praise the fact that he’s come out on the immigration issue. I’m beginning to get the idea that he’s a good salesman. That he’s an entrepreneur, and he has a good sense of what people want to hear, what they want to but understands the real sentiment of America.” Former Grand Wizard of the KKK David Duke 5. “Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,” Scott Leader, a Boston man who brutally attacked an undocumented homeless man on August 18th. 6. “There is no more California. It’s now international, lawless territory. Everything is up for grabs. Illegal aliens are murdering people there. People are being raped. Trump isn’t lying about anything — the rest of the country just hasn’t found out yet.” Cheryl Burns, 60 53 Trump supporter in Alabama 7. “Get out of my country!\" Donald Trump organizer to American-citizen and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos 8. “We are all Donald Trump now...Trump is important because he represents the first figure with the financial, cultural, and economic resources to openly defy elite consensus.” 9. “If Mr. Trump loses, this could be the last chance whites have to vote for a president who could actually do something useful for them and for their country.” Jared Taylor, publisher of American Renaissance, a popular white supremacist magazine 10. “Americans of ALL races are FED UP with this ILLEGAL ALIEN INVASION — so [Trump] says that he’ll BUILD a WALL to keep them out! CHEERS! He states that “Political Correctness” is disgusting and it’s time to STOP IT! More CHEERS! He DARES to turn his guns on the paid morons of the system controlled MEDIA! And regular folks LOVE it.” Rocky J. Suhayda, chair of the American Nazi party In Evan Osnos’ excellent New Yorker piece last week detailing Trump’s emerging support among white nationalists, he found many of his rallies were also populated by supporters casually selling white supremacist merchandise, from books such as “The True Selma Story,” “Authentic History of the Ku Klux Klan” to stickers reading “The Federal Empire Is Killing the American Dream”. Indeed, there is little evidence of Trump ever denouncing white nationalism outright, only vaguely belittling their value to him or acting like he doesn’t know who they are. He recently told Bloomberg News, for example, that he “doesn’t need” or “want” David Duke’s endorsement but when asked if he would repudiate the former KKK Grand Wizard, he glibly said, “sure, if it makes you feel better I will.” This answer was apparently good enough for Mark Halperin who quickly moved on but should outrage any thinking person. One should jump at the chance to distance themselves from the KKK, Trump did so reluctantly and only because it made Halperin “feel better”. It’s been said by many on the left that Trump’s policies are not that different from the mainstream GOP and that all he’s done is drop the dog whistle code language. This sentiment, while partially true, is looking more and more incomplete. White nationalists, for all their stupidity are a prickly bunch and if they’re coming out of the shadows to praise Trump it’s not just because he’s good with words. They’re doing so because his actual, concrete policy positions -- namely rounding up 11 million undocumented Americans - are, in effect, bringing ethnic cleansing into the mainstream. The media, who treat Trump's campaign more like a car accident than a real world, emerging proto-fascist threat, quietly go along, dismissing it as a \"quirk\" of a celebrity candidate than the actual policy of a top contender for the most powerful position in the world. In this sense, it’s Trump’s own supporters who are doing far more to discredit his campaign than the access-hungry political press who still, naively, see Trump as an amusing spectacle rather than the true threat to democracy he almost certainly is. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G. Newell, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:43 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced.

Maxine Waters (D-CA) at the end of his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday. Waters, the chair of the committee, expressed her displeasure with Mnuchin’s intention to leave the hearing early before all members had used their allotted time. \"Mr. Secretary, I want you to know, that no other secretary has ever told us the day before that they were going to limit their time in the way that you’re doing,” she said. “So if you want to use them as examples, you have acted differently than they have acted. And as I have said, if you wish to leave you may.” “If you’d wish to keep me here, so that I don’t have my important meeting, and continue to grill me, then we can do that, I will cancel my meeting and I will not be back here. I will be very clear,” Mnuchin said. “If that’s the way you’d like to have this relationship.” “Thank you!” said Waters. “The gentleman, the secretary has agreed to stay to hear all of the rest of the members. Please cancel your meeting and respect our time.” “You’re instructing me to stay here?” Mnuchin said. “No, you made me an offer! That I accepted,” she replied. “I did not make you an offer,” said Mnuchin. “You’re instructing me! You’re ordering me to stay here!” They continued to debate the matter, but Waters made clear that he was free to leave when he wanted. “Then please dismiss everybody,” Mnuchin said. “I believe you’re supposed to take the gravel and bang it, that’s the appropriate —” (Mnuchin mispronounced “gavel.”) “Please do not instruct me as to how I am to conduct this committee,” said Waters.

Lamberth's order was made public Friday,\" reported Robert Patrick. \"Chansley was required to show by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community, and Lamberth said he failed. Although Chansley's lawyer, Albert Watkins, had arranged for a place for Chansley to stay, with mental health treatment, Watkins failed to show how anyone would prevent Chansley from fleeing the area. Watkins' plan also does not mitigate the possibility that Chansley's supporters would provide him money to flee, the judge said.\" The 9/11 terrorist attacks did not just result in major changes to the U.S. government, but also the press corps. With President George W. Bush banging the drums of war, much of the national press rallied around the flag as Congress voted to invade Afghanistan, pass the Patriot Act, invade Iraq and create the Department of Homeland Security. Referring to it as a \"righteous strike,\" the U.S. Military carried out the last known drone strike in Afghanistan on Aug. 29, claiming they were targeting an ISIS suicide bomber who posed an imminent threat to U.S. troops. But a new report from The New York Times says that it was a case of mistaken identity that killed a U.S.-allied aid worker along with other innocent people. \"Military officials said they did not know the identity of the car's driver when the drone fired, but deemed him suspicious because of how they interpreted his activities that day, saying that he possibly visited an ISIS safe house and, at one point, loaded what they thought could be explosives into the car,\" the Times reports.

Following the news that President Donald Trump would likely pull out of the Paris agreement, Coburn told Fox Business host Stuart Varney that the accord was unfair to the United States. \"The studies right now would tell you that we're not warming right now,\" Coburn insisted. \"Really?\" Varney replied. \"What's this, 'Nine-nine percent of all the scientists [believe in man-made climate change]?'\" \"If you go and poll, what does the actual data say? I don't think you'll see 99 percent,\" Coburn said. \"You may see 75-25. You may see 25-75. You don't know that. Nobody knows because we have had this political mantra out there that say that if you doubt what we said, you're a flat Earther.\" \"You know, I went into the Congress in 1995 and they told me the same thing, the oceans are rising,\" he continued. \"Here we are some 22 years later, right? And what's the difference? One millimeter? Two millimeters?\" \"Is that it?\" Varney wondered. \"I don't know,\" Coburn admitted. \"But the fact is we have not seen a major encroachment. The ice storage in Antarctica is greater than it's ever been. They had more ice this year in the Arctic than we've seen in 30 years. So, tell me where this is.\" According to Coburn, the Paris agreement was an \"emotional and reactive\" response that did not take into account \"all the facts.\" \"I'm just a skeptic,\" he remarked. \"I've actually read all of it while I was a U.S. senator. I read all the science. I read everything that was out there.

        "articles": "Right Wing Watch posted about Christian conservative activist Wayne Allyn Root---the same one who posited that Obama must have blackmailed Justice Roberts on the Obamacare decision---going on a radio show and positing that gay people are just going to be getting all divorced all the time. From their coverage: I always found it facile to write off homobigots as all closeted gay people who are afraid to let their true desires out, as that is statistically impossible. But I do think you hear that theory a lot because there is a weird kind of resentment and jealousy that radiates off these people and it demands an explanation. I think these comments get to the root of it. They're not jealous that you get to have a bunch of gay sex. (Though I do think some do think that gay people have more and better sex, which creates some envy.) What I think is going on here is a little more complex, and Root's comments about what a miserable slog and hellpit of suffering marriage is gets at it. Look, I believe Root when he says that not only is his marriage miserable but that he believes marriage is inherently miserable. The religious right argument is that men and women are deeply, fundamentally different---opposites, really---who will never really understand each other. They often talk about marriage as a tense transaction, where women exchange sexual access and family service for financial support and a promise of fidelity. It's a worldview where marriage is seen as a grim duty, instead of something you do to be happy. This isn't even that hidden from the surface, as Ross Douthat's sour response to this decision shows. For a lot of homophobes, the logic appears to be something like this: I had to give up hope for happiness by saddling myself with a marriage to someone I don't really like much in order to fulfill my procreative duties. Who do you gays think you are, with all your talk of love and passion? You're starting to give other straight people the idea that they should marry for love? Piss on all of you. If I can't be happy, no one can. Indeed, if you think marriage should be about duty and not love, and that it's meant to be a slog from which only death provides sweet relief, then you probably don't see the problem with bullying gay people into marrying people of the opposite sex and committing to a life of pleasureless sex and resentment. That may, in fact, sound like your life. This kind of thinking was even in Justice Scalia's unhinged dissent in this case. In response to Justice Kennedy arguing that marriage allows people to \"find other freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality\", Scalia cracked a take-my-wife-please joke. \"Really? Who ever thought that intimacy and spirituality [whatever that means] were freedoms? And if intimacy is, one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage. Ask the nearest hippie.\" Hurk hurk, because people stop having sex when they get married, right? Thigh slap! Bitter laugh. Considering that these are the same folks who think you should not have sex before marriage, one does wonder when sex happens, in their worldview. It appears the answer is \"rarely, with the woman in particular being reluctant\". Needless to say, the impact of this decision on the divorce rate will be negligible. There's no reason to think that gay people think about marriage differently than straight people. The mentality Root is decrying---the belief that marriage should make you happy instead of being a miserable slog---is widespread amongst straight people. And it's actually associated with a lower divorce rate, because people hold out for partners that make them happy, making the commitment easier to stick with once it's made. Also, and this is a small but relevant point, the numbers don't add up. Even if every gay couple ever married got divorced, it would just be a minor bit of statistical noise compared to all the straight people getting married and divorced. As the New York Times notes, the number of married same-sex couples in this country is less than 400,000. That's out of 60 million married couples overall. Even if every single same-sex couple in this country got married, that would make them let than 2 percent of married couples in this country. I'm not saying this to minimize the issue of same-sex marriage. It's a critical issue and that is a lot of people! But it's worth noting that he's trying to scare people by making a claim---that gay couples will ratchet up the divorce rate---that wouldn't be possible even if his outrageous assumptions about how gay people live were true. More to the point, it tells you a lot about what's going on that Root blames a widespread phenomenon he disapproves of---marrying for love instead of duty---on a very small minority, a minority that is objectively too small to have that kind of impact on larger society. It really shows what's going on with the anti-gay movement. They have fairly broad objections about how we all live our lives, but they are afraid to level those accusations as straight people directly, because straight people are numerous and powerful and will laugh you out of the room if you deny us our right to marry for love. Gay people are the dumping ground for all these larger arguments these cowards are too afraid to lob at their fellow straight people. (As they should be, as these are bad arguments.) The 9/11 terrorist attacks did not just result in major changes to the U.S. government, but also the press corps. With President George W. Bush banging the drums of war, much of the national press rallied around the flag as Congress voted to invade Afghanistan, pass the Patriot Act, invade Iraq and create the Department of Homeland Security. Referring to it as a \"righteous strike,\" the U.S. Military carried out the last known drone strike in Afghanistan on Aug. 29, claiming they were targeting an ISIS suicide bomber who posed an imminent threat to U.S. troops. But a new report from The New York Times says that it was a case of mistaken identity that killed a U.S.-allied aid worker along with other innocent people. \"Military officials said they did not know the identity of the car's driver when the drone fired, but deemed him suspicious because of how they interpreted his activities that day, saying that he possibly visited an ISIS safe house and, at one point, loaded what they thought could be explosives into the car,\" the Times reports. In a 2018 interview with Lisa Luckett, whose husband Teddy worked and died in the World Trade Center building on September 11, 2001, Luckett told Salon one memory she never wants to forget from that horrific day was the \"beauty,\" \"grace,\" \"compassion,\" and \"incredible strength of the human spirit\" that followed. \"I never expected people to show up for me,\" Luckett said. Yet they did. ",

        "articles": "On March 21, Medium.com published an article by Silicon Valley resident Aaron Ginn claiming that the mainstream media’s reporting on the coronavirus pandemic is wildly exaggerated and that COVID-19 isn’t spreading to the degree that the media are reporting. Medium has since removed Ginn’s article, which was republished on Zero Hedge — and which biology professor Carl T. Bergstrom vigorously debunks in an in-depth Twitter thread. “This thread could be far longer than it is,” Bergstrom writes, “but I’m doing my best to only discuss the most glaring flaws.” In his article, Ginn wrote that “hysteria” was driving the discussion over coronavirus and went on to use so-called “data” to make his argument. But Bergstrom, in his thread, explains why Ginn’s arguments are both misleading and dangerous. Ginn claimed that “COVID-19 is spreading, but probably not accelerating.” According to Bergstrom, “The author discusses the apparent decline in daily growth rate irrespective of control measures. He begins with some truism about small numbers being easy to move; this is irrelevant in the face of the exponential growth that he stresses.” 1.

Bergstrom)1584836919.0 Bergstrom goes on to write that Ginn “fails to see that this drop in apparent growth rates is heavily driven by left censoring and shifts in testing strategy. Testing started at different times in different countries, was influenced by case density, and early-on, tests individuals in all stages of disease.” Ginn wrote, “Cases globally are increasing — it is a virus, after all — but beware of believing metrics designed to intentionally scare like ‘cases doubling.’ These are typically small numbers over small numbers and sliced on a per-country basis.” Bergstrom, in response, tweets, “That the virus can cross national boundaries does nothing to negate the importance of spatial structure and within-country analysis.” Bergstrom adds, “I hate to ascribe to malice what can be adequately explained by incompetence, but using this lie to sweep away the disaggregated data is such utter nonsense that I wonder how a Silicon Valley guy could make this claim by mistake.” 6.

If the bell-curve were a ‘law of nature,’ it shouldn’t necessarily apply to the vast range of human responses that people take to stop epidemics. Yet this assertion is supported with data from places where interventions slowed things down.” Ginn writes that “93% of people who (think) they are positive aren’t.” And Bergstrom responds, “This is just misleading. Being tested is not the same as thinking you are positive. Did your doctor ever order a rapid flu test or strep culture or a chest x-ray for pneumonia? When you did, did you think YOU were positive?

        "articles": "Russian state media -- and Kremlin-backed trolls -- are helping to push Brett Kavanaugh's nomination the U.S. Supreme Court as part of a broader effort to undermine American democracy. Julia Davis, a Russian media watchdog, published a column for The Daily Beast that tracked how the country's state-run media is amplifying President Donald Trump's defense of his embattled judicial nominee. “Guess what stands in Kavanaugh’s way?\" said Kremlin propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov. \"Certainly, the disease of malignant feminism … used to destroy promising careers and eliminate political opponents.\" Vitaly Milonov, a Russian lawmaker allied with president Vladimir Putin, called for the imprisonment of feminists -- who he called \"monkey\" and \"witches.\" Hamilton 68, a website that tracks Russian influence operations on social media, found a high level of activity by Twitter bots backing Kavanaugh and amplifying the GOP defense. The operation even seemed to influence Trump, who claimed in a Friday morning tweet that anti-Kavanaugh protesters had been paid by billionaire financier George Soros. That conspiracy theory was previously advanced by the state-run RT network, Davis said. The Kremlin's support for Kavanaugh is intended to highlight divisions in American politics, according to Davis and other experts. All this is part of a broader picture in which the Kremlin continues to differentiate between Trump and the American government. \"Russia is not 'Republican,'\" tweeted former FBI agent Asha Rangappa. \"It has the highest abortion rate in the world...do you think they give a damn about overturning Roe v. Wade??\" \"They are pro-Kavanaugh bc they know he will divide U.S. and undermine Americans' faith in the most revered legal institution in the country,\" she added. Kavanaugh is one of the most deeply unpopular Supreme Court nominees in history, and Democrats are furious at Republican efforts to ram his nomination through the Senate. \"Russian state media is supporting Trump’s Kavanaugh nomination both in its domestic publications, as well as those aimed at the English-speaking audiences,\" Davis said. \"All this is part of a broader picture in which the Kremlin continues to differentiate between Trump and the American government.\" Did the Cyber Ninjas botch another attempt to recount Maricopa County's 2020 presidential ballots—an attempt that, so far, has escaped wide media coverage? It appears, at the very least, that a contract signed on July 28 by the Cyber Ninjas—the lead contractor in the Arizona Senate Republicans' election review—and Dr. V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai, a Boston-based technologist and unsuccessful GOP U.S. Senate candidate, indicated that all 2020 election results would be tallied by August—and that deadline has now been missed. On Friday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a federal judge is refusing to release Jacob Chansley, an infamous January 6 Capitol rioter known as the \"QAnon Shaman,\" to St. Louis ahead of his sentencing. \"U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth's order was made public Friday,\" reported Robert Patrick. \"Chansley was required to show by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community, and Lamberth said he failed. Although Chansley's lawyer, Albert Watkins, had arranged for a place for Chansley to stay, with mental health treatment, Watkins failed to show how anyone would prevent Chansley from fleeing the area. Watkins' plan also does not mitigate the possibility that Chansley's supporters would provide him money to flee, the judge said.\" The 9/11 terrorist attacks did not just result in major changes to the U.S. government, but also the press corps.

The report adds that PAC money to Democrats and Republicans who voted to certify the results were only down about 30 percent and 35 percent respectively. The Journal goes on to add that some the GOP lawmakers who saw their business PAC money shrivel up did see a surge in dollars sent by small donors. \"PAC money isn't critical to some high-profile politicians who voted against certifying the election results such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.), whose campaigns are heavily funded by small online donations.

As Lewis notes, Powell's latest legal defense responding to the lawsuit that she wasn't to be taken seriously is 'literally nuts.\" Pointing out that words matter, the conservative pointed out that Powell isn't going to be allowed off the hook for her comments as Dominion comes after her, Rudy Giuliani and Fox News for defaming the company and damaging them economically. Writing, \"Many average Americans (reasonable or not) seriously believed the kinds of lies Powell was intent on spreading,\" Lewis added, \"It is true that Powell was merely one of the voices pushing bogus claims and conspiracy theories, but her voice was one of the most prominent. A quick refresher is in order. Prior to taking on this cause, Powell represented former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Prominent conservatives like past FEC chairman Trey Trainor personally vouched for her honesty. She was also considered to be part of an \"elite strike force\" of Trump lawyers (as Trump tweeted, a 'truly great team'). Newsmax also identified her as such.\" With all of that on her resume, the columnist asserted, Powell can hardly expect that she will get a pass for her claims that received national attention. \"This is all to say that, although you and I might have always seen Powell as a crank, she had (on paper) solid professional and mainstream conservative credentials—not to mention the imprimatur of the Republican National Committee, America's Mayor, and the President of the United States of America,\" He wrote. \"The reality is, you can't have it both ways. You can't claim to be a serious person engaging in the serious world of politics and ideas, spread toxic poison with a megaphone that reaches millions, and then cry 'just kidding' when your attempts to actually overthrow an election fail.\" \"Ideas have consequences, and the ideas we are dealing with now are deadly serious—including the notion that the election was stolen in a coup and that American democracy is in jeopardy,\" he continued before adding, \"It will likely take a lawsuit from a private company to discourage future demagogues and their accomplices from pursuing perverse incentives. Lawsuits may be the only effective mechanism left to hold irresponsible and dangerous actors accountable for their actions. I guess it's better than nothing.\" You can read more here. Former Vice President Mike Pence Friday made a rare TV appearance to rail against President Biden’s new push for COVID vaccine mandates as “unlike anything we’ve heard before.” In his first television interview since leaving office, Pence suggested Biden’s tougher approach on requiring COVID vaccinations amounts to violating personal freedom.

Washington Post reporter Philip Bump on Friday compared states that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020 with states that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020 and found it was \"impossible\" to separate politics from pandemic outcomes. In a chart posted on his Twitter account, Bump showed how much Biden-voting states have diverged from Trump-voting states ever since vaccines started rolling out late last year, and he found that blue states are now doing significantly better than they were a year ago at this time, while red states are doing significantly worse. MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and a group of his allies met with Donald Trump over dinner on Aug. 13 — the date Lindell had previously promised would bring Trump's \"reinstatement\" as president — sources have told Salon. The previously-unreported meeting occurred shortly after the bedding tycoon's \"cyber symposium\" in South Dakota, which failed to produce anything close to proof of election fraud. Josh Merritt, a former member of Lindell's \"red team\" at the South Dakota gathering, told Salon that the meeting occurred at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach on the evening of Aug. 13. According to Merritt, New Mexico State University law professor David K. Clements, a Lindell associate and \"election truther,\" talked about the potential Trump meeting ahead of time, during the cyber symposium. \"David said he was trying to get on as a lawyer for 45,\" Merritt said adding that Clements saw Lindell's relationship with Trump as a way to gain access to the inner circles of TrumpWorld.

        "articles": "A little over eight years ago, Naderite dead-enders were still refusing to admit that they had a hand in turning the keys to America over to undead thing Dick Cheney and his protege George W. Bush in 2000. After threatening to go third party once again because that turned out so awesome, I wrote this under \"Your Mumia sweatshirt won't get you into heaven anymore\": You don’t live there. Grow the fuck up. Well, we're right back where we started again, aren't we? Yes we are. This time a much more polite Robert Reich is attempting to make the same point. Last week Reich told fellow Bernie Sanders supporters that they should continue to \"fight like hell\" for their candidate to become the Democratic presidential nominee but, should he come up short, they should back Hillary Clinton. It wasn't received particularly well. Reich returned to Facebook again today to take another stab at it by curb-stomping (but once again politely) some of the dumbest arguments to either vote third party or throw up their hands and let Donald Trump become president because -- well, what's the worse that could happen? Reich began by pointing out the obvious, writing: \"Regardless of what you may think of Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump is a true menace to this nation and to the world. He’s a narcissistic, xenophobic, hatemonger who, if elected, would legitimize bigotry, appoint Supreme Court justices with terrible values, and have his finger on the nuclear bomb.\" Reich then dropped a little history on folks who believe that a Trump presidency would awaken a Great Progressive Uprising that would rise up from the smoking wreckage of the lives of others here and abroad. \"Some of you say a Trump presidency would be so horrible it would galvanize a forceful progressive movement in response. The problem with this argument is twofold. First, Trump could do huge and unalterable damage to America and the world in the meantime. Second, rarely if ever in history has a sharp swing to the right moved the political pendulum further back in the opposite direction. Instead, it tends to move the “center” rightward, as did Ronald Reagan’s presidency.\" And now here comes the part that is gonna \"bern\" their britches: \"Finally, some of you say that even if Hillary is better than Trump, you’re tired of choosing the 'lesser of two evils,' and you’re going to vote your conscience by either writing Bernie’s name in, or voting for the Green Party candidate, or not voting at all. I can’t criticize you for voting your conscience, of course. But your conscience should know that a decision not to vote for Hillary is a de facto decision to help Donald Trump.\" Whomp. So you could be excused for thinking that people might read the writing on Reich's Facebook wall and say to themselves,\"That is a reasonable argument and although I don't necessarily agree with it, I will take it into consideration when I enter the voting booth.\" And you would, of course, be wrong: And my favorite: 2106: Just like 2008 -- but even more illogical and why we still have to fight with our own side so we can have nice things. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G. Newell, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:43 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced. A judge since 2016 and before that Caroline County's top prosecutor for more than a decade, he was to be taken into custody on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child, prosecutors said,\" reported Justin Fenton. \"A boy that Newell took on a hunting trip on Hoopers Island discovered a hidden camera in the bathroom on July 23, and his parents reported it to police, which The Sun reported last week.\" Sen.

        "articles": "Former Minnesota governor and one-time professional wrestler Jesse Ventura has run afoul of the Huffington Post's no-conspiracy-theory policy, and he's not happy about it. \"I can't believe the Huffington Post today will practice censorship,\" Ventura says in astonishment. \"I've got news for them. ... I won't ever write for 'em again.\" Ventura had posted an item on Tuesday which took note of a recent conference at which \"more than one thousand architects and engineers signed a petition demanding that Congress begin a new investigation into the destruction of the World Trade Center skyscrapers on 9/11.\" He also quoted a few paragraphs from his new book, American Conspiracies, to explain why some of those experts see signs of controlled demolition. The item was featured on the front page of Huffington Post when it first went up, but after a few hours it vanished. All that appears now at its original location is an editor's note saying, \"The Huffington Post's editorial policy, laid out in our blogger guidelines, prohibits the promotion and promulgation of conspiracy theories -- including those about 9/11. As such, we have removed this post.\" The note is followed by three pages of comments, enthusiastically arguing the pros and cons of controlled demolition and other 9/11 theories, that were posted during the couple of hours before the entry was deleted and comments were closed. Huffington Post's own guidelines for its bloggers state, \"We must -- and do -- reserve the right to remove objectionable, inaccurate, or inflammatory material and, if necessary, suspend or revoke blogging privileges. This also includes propagating conspiracy theories and blogging about behind-the-scenes housekeeping issues that are not of interest to the general public.\" Anastasia Churkina, a correspondent for RT, interviewed Ventura about the controversy. \"He's a man who doesn't mince his words too much,\" she reported on Thursday. \"He was pretty blunt.\" \"I can't believe the Huffington Post today will practice censorship,\" Ventura told her angrily. \"They asked me to be a contributing editor and they said, 'Write about anything you want.' So it was the second time I did something -- and they removed it?\" \"Well, I've got news for them,\" he continued. \"I won't ever write for 'em again. ... I won't do a thing for the Huffington Post because I don't like it when people censor what I have to say.\" \"All I do is ask questions!\" he exploded. \"That's what bugs me about 9/11. 9/11 is an event you're not allowed to ask a question about. ... Clearly they don't want any questions on it.\" Ironically, Ventura had to go to RT, the English-language version of a Russian news channel, to tell his story. Although polls show that large numbers of Americans believe in a broad range of conspiracy theories, and a majority entertain doubts about the official story of 9/11, few of those questions ever appear in the mainstream media. As Raw Story recently reported , \"In November of 2007, an online article noted, 'Nearly two-thirds of Americans think it is possible that some federal officials had specific warnings of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, but chose to ignore those warnings, according to a Scripps Howard News Service/Ohio University poll.' A national survey of 811 adult residents of the United States conducted by Scripps and Ohio University found that more than a third believe in a broad smorgasbord of conspiracy theories including the attacks, international plots to rig oil prices, the plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy in 1963 and the government’s knowledge of intelligent life from other worlds. The high percentage is a manifestation, some say, of an American public that increasingly distrusts the federal government.\" Even liberal websites, however, discourage questions about 9/11, to the point where BooMan of the Booman Tribune had to preface a post at Daily Kos in 2005 by writing \"I know this touches on verboten conspiracy theories, but this is a front-page NYT article.\" \"It's kind of hard to tell whether or not a new investigation will be launched,\" Churkina concluded. \"Many people don't think this is going to be happening any time soon, even with such public figures, like Jesse Venture and other, calling for it.\" This video from RT was posted at YouTube on March 12, 2010. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

        "articles": "In an alternately biting and hilarious column for the Daily Beast, author Molly Jong-Fast observed that Rudy Giuliani's future looks bleak based upon the defense presented by himself, his son and other advisers after federal authorities raided his home this week with a warrant signed by a judge. As NBC reported, \"On Wednesday, federal agents raided the home and office of former President Donald Trump's personal attorney, collecting phones and computers as part of their probe into whether he broke U.S. lobbying laws by failing to register as a foreign agent related to his work.\" What followed, Jong-Fast wrote was a \"clown car\" defense of the former New York City mayor that was long on ranting and short on convincing anyone that Giuliani is the subject of a witchhunt. Exhibit number one: \"Failson\" Andrew Giuliani's defense of his father after the raid. Calling Andrew a \"poor man's Eric Trump,\" Jong-Fast wrote Giuliani's son, \"jabbed the air awkwardly while yelling furiously about how, 'If this can happen to the president's lawyer, this can happen to any one of us'—the idea being that if Rudy were subject to the rule of law perhaps the rest of us would be too.\" Jong-Fast added, \"For years, scandals have swirled around the former mayor's erratic behavior. Remember the one where he kept tampering with foreign governments and trying to get American officials fired and helped get his client, Donald Trump, impeached for a second time? So these warrants surprised no one except young Giuliani, whose hot take was: How dare they?\" Then there was Rudy himself who quickly ran to Fox News to try and explain away what was going on as the Justice Department appears to be closing in on him. As the columnist noted, \"On his first television appearance after the raid, Rudy told Tucker Carlson that, 'They also were completely content to rely on my word that these were Hunter Biden's hard drives… I mean, they could have been Donald Trump's, they could have been Vladimir Putin's. They could have been anybody's, but they relied on me, the man who had to be raided in the morning. Because, what, I'm going to destroy the evidence? I've known about this for two years, Tucker.' So I guess that's proof that he didn't? At one point he jerked his thumb up while talking about the great iCloud in the sky that supposedly rendered this raid unnecessary.\" The Daily Beast columnist noted that the former U.S. Attorney is now being advised by Alan Dershowitz --who has been inserting himself into lost causes during the past four years in the service of Donald Trump -- and that doesn't bode well for the man once known as \"America's Mayor.\" \"Maybe Rudy's worried now that the senior political appointees at Trump's Justice Department who sought to block the warrants after the election, 'as it was gaining momentum last year' are gone, and now that it's too late for him to get the sort of pardon or commutation that loyal soldiers like Roger Stone, Mike Flynn, and Paul Manafort were rewarded with,\" Jong-Fast wrote before sardonically adding, \"And maybe that's why Rudy's not taking legal advice from Andrew but from Alan, as in Dershowitz, who's now consulting with Giuliani's lawyers. The best people, folks.\" The columnist closed by taking another poke at Giuliani. \"As to Rudy, who was once a lawyer himself and has been talking about how far his beloved Southern District has fallen, as it closes in on him, he told Tucker, 'I could have destroyed evidence years ago. I've had it for two years, and I haven't destroyed it,' and since no one ever lies on Fox News, I guess that's case closed,\" she snarked. You can read the whole piece here -- subscription required.

        "articles": "Vice President Mike Pence next month will address Christians United for Israel, a group founded by megachurch Pastor John Hagee, who once said Hitler was a “hunter” sent by God to expedite the return of Jews to Israel. According to Right Wing Watch, Pence has signed on to speak at Christians United’s annual gathering in Washington D.C., after Hagee supported the president and vice president throughout the 2016 presidential election. Hagee made the remarks in a 1990s sermon uncovered during the 2008 presidential election—which prompted then-candidate John McCain to disavow the prominent evangelical. “‘And they the hunters should hunt them,’ that will be the Jews,” Hagee said in that sermon, which he later apologized for. “ ‘From every mountain and from every hill and from out of the holes of the rocks’—If that doesn’t describe what Hitler did in the holocaust you can’t see that.” “Theodore Herzl is the father of Zionism,” Hagee continued. “He was a Jew who at the turn of the 19th century said, this land is our land, God wants us to live there. So he went to the Jews of Europe and said ‘I want you to come and join me in the land of Israel.’ So few went that Hertzel went into depression.” “Those who came founded Israel; those who did not went through the hell of the Holocaust,” he added. “Then god sent a hunter. A hunter is someone with a gun and he forces you. Hitler was a hunter.” Pence’s boss, Donald Trump has pledged support for evangelical Christians. Last week, the president spoke at the Christian conservative nonprofit Faith and Freedom Coalition, arguing “It is time to put a stop to the attacks on religion.” “We will end the discrimination against people of faith. Our government will once again celebrate and protect religious freedom,” he said, later adding he and his evangelical audience are “under siege.” On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G.

The Trump campaign and RNC had to make 530,000 refunds worth more than $64 million. Again, I've never heard anything close to that in campaigns before. This shows you, this is an epic, you know, an epic systemic issue.\" \"John, it's a little late for anybody to be shocked at this kind of behavior from Donald Trump,\" said Harwood. \"Remember, during the 2016 campaign, when Marco Rubio was running against him for the Republican nomination, he said that Donald Trump was a con artist. But it is not too late to be appalled by this.\" \"On behalf of those people who loyally stood with Donald Trump, who backed him, believing he was their champion, and then to find that the for-profit company that worked with the Trump campaign set up this situation where they would extract money out of your bank account, they would even double the amount that you had said you wanted to contribute by having pre-checked the box that said you want to double your contribution?\" said Harwood. \"Yes, sure, the Trump campaign may have wanted you to double your donation.

        "articles": "Yesterday, there was a blitz of news about how Jeb Bush, in 1995, openly called for public shaming of single mothers in his book nauseatingly and incorrectly titled Profiles in Character. Even more entertainingly, he demonstrated how his reading comprehension rates well below that of a high school freshman's, by arguing that The Scarlet Letter was a celebration of puritanical abuses towards women. \"Infamous shotgun weddings and Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter are reminders that public condemnation of irresponsible sexual behavior has strong historical roots,\" he wrote. Indeed, it's also a reminder that theocracy, the abuse of women, the shunning of illegitimate children as \"bastards\", and treating adultery like a crime have strong historical roots, but that doesn't mean we should bring them back. I realize that the Bush family isn't big on reading, but for fuck's sake, that book isn't even about a woman being shunned for an \"out of wedlock\" birth, which was common enough in those times. For those who have read the book or know what a fucking Cliff Note is, you already know that Hester Pyrnne's crime is adultery, thus the letter \"A\". The birth was just one of those rare instances of having undeniable proof of the adultery, since Hester got pregnant while her husband was far away. Having one of those shotgun weddings that Bush longs for wasn't even an option for her. She was still married. Jesus Christ, read a book before you fucking write one. Also, say what you will, but the hypocritical Puritans that condemn Hester aren't exactly fucking heroes in that book. But what is really interesting about this story is how quickly things changed. Even though it's standard operating procedure for conservatives to hand-wring about single motherhood, openly calling for shaming them about having sex has fallen from right wing fashion since 1995. Even Jeb Bush changed his tune. As Laura Bassett writes, Bush was quite the panty-sniffer when he first started out as Florida's governor. Two short years later, he signed a repeal of the same law. Maybe it's because it was struck down by the court, but nah. It can't be that, or else you'd just let the court order stand and not tinker with it. As Adam Weinstein points out, part of what changed is that \"compassionate conservatism\"---where you pretend that your efforts to hurt and punish people are rooted in a desire to help them---became a thing after Jeb's war-mongering brother successfully deceived some people into thinking he was a well-meaning Christian. Now we're all awash in conservatives trying to bullshit us into thinking that they agree with liberal goals like equality and dignity for all, but just have a different way of approaching it. But I would add that, in this specific instance, it's all about the anti-choicers. In the past decade plus, anti-choicers have really started to realize that showing their true face---that they are a bunch of prudes who want to stomp out recreational sex and think that women, especially young women and poor women, who have sex for fun are dirty sluts---is political suicide in a society where nearly everyone has premarital sex and uses contraception, demonstrating conclusively that it's being done for the fun of it instead of as a grim march to baby-making. Instead, the gambit is to pretend that they oppose abortion (and, increasingly contraception), because they care about women, who they portray as asexual dupes who only use contraception and abortion because they are being exploited by caddish men and blood-thirsty abortion doctors. Instead of portraying sexual women as gross sluts who need to be shamed, they portray them as lost souls who need firm guidance to find their true destiny as mothers and wives who occasionally and reluctantly give it up to keep their men docile and faithful. That means the portrayal of the single mother has shifted. No longer is she the slattern who jumps around on every cock in town, oblivious to the consequences. Now she is the darling angel who only had sex because she's been confused by feminists and perverts into thinking that's how you catch a man. And now the poor dear is left alone and pregnant and has learned her lesson about men, which is they will never love you and therefore the only way to \"catch\" one is to use sex as bait instead of \"giving it up\" freely. And, of course, the single mother, in this framework, is a woman who chose to live with the \"consequences\" instead of someone who just had an abortion and made it all go away. If you're anti-choice, there is an inescapable conflict between your desire to shame someone for having sex and celebrate someone for \"choosing life\". Abortion, as every anti-choicer knows and obsesses over, is a neat way to make sure no one knows that you were pregnant. That's why they show up at clinics, to let women know that they still see them and will shame them for what they did. In order to dispel the notion that they're all about shaming sexuality, anti-choicers have to, however, reluctantly, pretend that single motherhood is better than having an abortion. Naomi Cahn and June Carbone had an interesting piece on this at Slate a couple years ago: It is worth noting that there is a lot of complexity hiding behind \"single\" vs. \"married\" motherhood. Because of these social forces, conservatives tend to conflate women giving birth without being married first with women raising children alone. In reality, a lot of \"unwed\" mothers are living with the fathers and many of them will eventually marry. In addition, a lot of single mothers were married but have divorced the fathers. High rates of single parenthood do not suggest that people are abandoning marriage or partnership as an ideal. And let's be clear: None of this means that the right has given up the idea that women should be punished for having sex. The anti-abortion and anti-contraception crackdown makes that abundantly clear. Bullying, guilt-tripping, or forcing women to become single mothers instead of choosing abortion is just a way to create \"consequences\" for sex. They've just learned to dress it up a little more to make it seem a little less hateful. But Bush's 1995 book is a nice reminder of the ugly thoughts lurking under the pretty, faux-compassionate smiles. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G. Newell, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:43 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced. A judge since 2016 and before that Caroline County's top prosecutor for more than a decade, he was to be taken into custody on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child, prosecutors said,\" reported Justin Fenton. \"A boy that Newell took on a hunting trip on Hoopers Island discovered a hidden camera in the bathroom on July 23, and his parents reported it to police, which The Sun reported last week.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Friday criticized President Joe Biden for ending the war in Afghanistan, which dragged on for two decades. Before taking over Strom Thurmond's seat in the U.S. Senate, Graham voted for the war in Afghanistan as a member of the House of Representatives. The United States may soon hit yet another major milestone in its efforts to vaccinate its citizens against the novel coronavirus. Reuters reports that American regulators could authorize Pfizer's vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 as soon as the end of October. ",

        "articles": "Welcome to another edition of What Fresh Hell?, Raw Story’s roundup of news items that might have become controversies under another regime, but got buried – or were at least under-appreciated – due to the daily firehose of political pratfalls, unhinged tweet storms and other sundry embarrassments coming out of the current White House. The Founders worried about a shrewd, popular Machiavellian leader consolidating power and turning their experiment in self-governance into a tyranny. They saw the separation of powers as a bulwark against such a scenario coming to pass. The legislature and the judiciary would be the executive branch's equals, and the three would keep each other in check. (Fans of School House Rock know this, even if the President* of the United States does not.) They also worried about a future president disregarding the laws when it suited him. So they wrote the Take Care Clause into the Constitution. Article II, Section 3 reads in part, that the president “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed....” In a 1792 letter to Alexander Hamilton, George Washington wrote, \"it is my duty to see the Laws executed: to permit them to be trampled upon with impunity would be repugnant to it; nor can the Government longer remain a passive spectator of the contempt with which they are treated.\" Some were concerned about the rise of \"factions,\" which we call parties today. But the Founders probably couldn't envision the members of a future Congress feeling a greater sense of loyalty to their faction than to the country and the Constitution they drafted. That's precisely where we have been for the past 26 months. For the first two years of his presidency, Donald Trump enjoyed impunity-by-Congressional majority. Now he sees that House Democrats won't impeach him as long as the Republican-controlled Senate wouldn't convict him, and that means that, regardless of what anyone says, he is effectively above the law. And he knows it. Last week, Trump ordered his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, to violate a 1924 anti-corruption law that says quite clearly that the IRS shall turn over any tax return upon request by one of the relevant Congressional committees. And this week, CNN reported that he told another cabinet member, acting DHS Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, to order Border Patrol agents to \"block asylum seekers from entering the US in defiance of US law,\" and promised to pardon him if he were ever held accountable for doing so. This comes after he's spent the past two years exuberantly violating the Emoluments Clause and making a small fortune off of his presidency, and as he promises to weaponize a law enforcement agency to wield against his political foes. Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as repor…  — Donald J. Trump (@Donald J. Trump)1555087082.0 It's possible, or even likely, that Trump thinks impeachment would be the ultimate tool for firing up his cultish base. If so, we can expect him to continue to disregard the law--and, as his mendacious and bigoted attack on Rep. Ilhan Omar just a week after one of his deranged supporters was arrested for threatening to put a bullet into her skull suggests, the bounds of decency--for the remainder of his presidency. In his eyes, it's a win-win situation. And it just confirms that impunity always breeds more lawlessness. And with that happy thought, here are some of the lesser outrages you may have missed this week. ***** Speaking of lawlessness, in its more severe forms, this is widely considered to be a form of torture… U.S. Border Patrol accused of forcing migrant families to wake up and stand every three hours  — Prof. Chris Zepeda-Millán (@Prof. Chris Zepeda-Millán)1554614871.0 Keep in mind that most of these people haven't violated the law, or are accused of committing a misdemeanor offense. ***** And The Houston Chronicle reported this week that a mother and her two daughters, who had fled El Salvador, applied for asylum in the US and \"since then have complied with court orders and appearance dates.\" They were then shocked to learn that a judge had ordered one of the children, an 11-year-old girl, top be deported without her family. That isn't policy. Or at least not yet. Immigration authorities said it was the family's fault for missing a court appearance, but an attorney representing the girl \"blamed the Executive Office for Immigration Review, a branch of the Justice Department overseeing immigration courts, for the error resulting in the 11-year-old’s deportation.\" ***** Meanwhile, The NYT reported that Trump \"wants to issue more visas for foreign workers to take temporary jobs in housekeeping, landscaping and other fields — even as [he] seeks to seal off the border with Mexico, where most of those workers come from.\" Last year, Vox reported that \"several of [Trump's] golf clubs hire workers on the H-2B visa program. Hiring records seem to show that Trump clubs don’t try too hard to find US workers in the high season, and the company’s recruiters usually say that no Americans even apply for them.\" It should go without saying that #MAGA Nation doesn't care. ***** Last week, we mentioned that Trump's pick to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, AccuWeather CEO Barry Myers, had such blatant conflicts of interest that he makes the rest of the regime look like they have some integrity by comparison. This week, The WaPo reported that he also ran the joint like a frat house that really needs to be suspended from campus. \"A federal workplace investigation found rampant sexual harassment and retaliation at AccuWeather, a federal contractor, including groping, touching and kissing of subordinates without consent.\" The investigation, which began in March 2017, also found that AccuWeather was “aware” of the sexual harassment but took no action to correct it, despite the company’s claims that it was not privy to any harassing activity. ***** This move is kind of inexplicable. Via Thompson-Reuters… Government lawyers said on Wednesday they would not appeal a decision by a Michigan federal judge who dismissed charges involving FGM as unconstitutional, ruling it was a state issue. Congress in 1996 outlawed FGM, a ritual that involves partial or total removal of external genitalia, which the World Health Organization has called \"a grave violation of the human rights of girls and women.\" Just learned Trump DOJ has now abandoned its defense of the statute criminalizing, of all things, female genital mu…  — Neal Katyal (@Neal Katyal)1554946638.0 ***** According to Pulitzer Prize-0winning tax journalist David Cay Johnston, only a handful of Americans would have to file tax returns if the government simply used the data it already collects to determine people's tax bill. The only reason that kind of system hasn't been set up is lobbying by tax preparation companies like H&R Block and Turbotax. Anyway… New: Congress is about to *make it illegal* for the government to offer free online tax filing. Thank TurboTax.  — Justin Elliott (@Justin Elliott)1554810606.0 ***** Speaking of perfectly legal corruption, Buzzfeed News reported this week that \"House Republicans are warning drug companies against complying with a House investigation into drug prices.\" ***** And we shouldn't forget that as the regime moves to cut off all disaster relief to Puerto Rico, the impact of Hurricane Maria continues to pain the US territory. The New York Times reported that the only delivery room on the \"ravaged island of Vieques\" remains shuttered 18 months after the storm made landfall there, \"forcing expectant mothers to travel, usually by sea, to the big island eight miles away to have their babies.\" ***** There wasn't much in the way of good news this week. But a federal judge in California agreed with the ACLU and \"blocked the Trump administration from requiring asylum-seekers to return to Mexico as they await court hearings in the U.S.\" NPR has more on that story. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G. Newell, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:43 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced.

According to McCarthy, the party \"Democrat\" was used by many racists during the Civil War. Today, the Republican Party is harbor to racists. According to the good people of Merriam-Webster, the word \"democrat\" is a 1790 word that means, adherent or advocate of democracy.\" From French démocrate (18c., opposed to aristocrate). It explains that it was \"formally revived in U.S. as a political party affiliation 1798, with a capital D.\" In the 1790s, the two main parties today were actually one main one, known as Democratic-Republicans, the party of then Vice President and future President Thomas Jefferson, who was opposed to the Federalist Party at the time. So, by McCarthy's logic, if Republicans are truly committed to opposing Democrats, they should change their name, because during the 1790s, they were known as Democratic-Republicans. See the video and the mockery of McCarthy below: Referring to it as a \"righteous strike,\" the U.S. Military carried out the last known drone strike in Afghanistan on Aug. 29, claiming they were targeting an ISIS suicide bomber who posed an imminent threat to U.S. troops. But a new report from The New York Times says that it was a case of mistaken identity that killed a U.S.-allied aid worker along with other innocent people. \"Military officials said they did not know the identity of the car's driver when the drone fired, but deemed him suspicious because of how they interpreted his activities that day, saying that he possibly visited an ISIS safe house and, at one point, loaded what they thought could be explosives into the car,\" the Times reports. In a 2018 interview with Lisa Luckett, whose husband Teddy worked and died in the World Trade Center building on September 11, 2001, Luckett told Salon one memory she never wants to forget from that horrific day was the \"beauty,\" \"grace,\" \"compassion,\" and \"incredible strength of the human spirit\" that followed. \"I never expected people to show up for me,\" Luckett said. Yet they did. CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale has debunked a viral video making false claims of mass walkouts by active duty service members who are refusing to get vaccinated. In the video, a bald man with sunglasses said that said he learned of mass walkouts by members of the military from his father. ",

A loss of just one seat in the 2020 elections would force them to share power with Democrats, and a loss of two seats would give Democrats control of the chamber outright for the first time since 1966. According to The Arizona Republic, the GOP may well be on their way to losing one of those seats — for an incredibly bizarre reason. \"Unless Rep. Shawnna Bolick really is living in a tiny box on Bell Road, she may be in a heap of trouble,\" wrote Laurie Roberts. \"A lawsuit was filed on Monday asking a judge to toss Bolick off the ballot. This, because she listed her residential address as 610 E. Bell Road, 2-142, both on her nominating petitions and on her circulator verification forms. Then she declared 'under penalty of perjury' that the information was true. That address is a UPS store.\" \"Bolick will have a chance to explain at a hearing before Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Scott McCoy on April 29 how she’s exempt from the state law that says a candidate 'shall sign and cause to be filed a nomination paper giving the person’s actual residence address or description of place of residence and post office address,'\" wrote Roberts. \"If the one-term Republican is tossed from the Aug. 4 ballot, that should clear the way for Democrats to pick up the seat.\" Incredibly, this isn't even the first time this election cycle that a Republican has falsely listed a UPS store as their place of residence.

During the segment, Smith noted that the Florida Republican Party, behind the scenes, is terrified that the investigation could sweep up more of their members. \"The web of corruption that Matt Gaetz, Joel Greenberg, and [Ron] DeSantis are all wrapped up in is really a web that appears to tie up the entire Republican Party of Florida,\" said Smith. \"It seems like everyone in the Capitol is nervous about what the next revelation is going to be and who else is implicated in this sweeping saga of corruption that they've been a part of for so long.\" \"This is what happens when any particular party is allowed to stay in power for as long as Florida Republicans have,\" he continued. \"It's not only about corruption, but they just get sloppy, they get lazy, and they get messy and arrogant. And I think that that's how Matt Gaetz got in trouble — he got arrogant.\" Gaetz faces allegations that he transported a 17-year-old girl over state lines for sex acts.

What do you expect to see in terms of accountability and having some sense that there is some closure to any of this?\" Lithwick asked. \"The one that we know about most directly and most prominently is the one you mentioned, the Manhattan district attorney's investigation into Trump's finances and business dealings,\" the attorney replied. \"I don't know because I've not been in the grand jury, I've not interviewed the witnesses.

        "articles": "A bevy of “right-to-work” laws has been introduced in state legislatures across the United States this year. The legislation has generated intense debate and contention, making headlines across the country. What was most alarming about the parade of bills introduced this year, however, was how their proponents manipulated facts in order to propel them through state legislatures. As a sociologist who studies unions and someone who relies on good quantitative data, I am bothered most by how the mathematics used to justify these arguments is so deeply flawed – mistakes that any student of statistics could easily spot. Lately I’ve been focusing on the battle over right-to-work legislation in New Mexico, where a bill was dealt a death blow in the state Senate at the final hour. But workers in other states such as Wisconsin have not fared as well. In March, the Midwestern state became the 25th in the US to prohibit unions from negotiating contracts that require union and nonunion employees to pay their share of costs for all the benefits the union provides. The results of this war on workers may vary from state to state, but the genesis of these salvos and the misleading arguments used to muscle them through legislatures are the same. A careful analysis reveals their scientific and intellectual flaws. The legislation that failed to pass in New Mexico was eerily similar to boiler-plate language that conservative organizations such as the National Right to Work Committee and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) have been circulating through regional lobbying organizations that are typically part of the conservative State Policy Network. In New Mexico, that organization is the Rio Grande Foundation. Its president, Paul Gessing, has argued in various news outlets and in testimony to legislators that right-to-work laws increase economic growth, jobs and personal income. The problem? As I’ve noted elsewhere when challenging Gessing’s arguments, he and others have based these assertions not on scientific evidence but on the faulty math of failing to control for the multitude of factors that contribute to economic growth. The problem with the misuse of math is illustrated plainly by the well-worn storks and babies example. Numerous studies have found a correlation between an increase in the stork population and a rise in human birth rates. Of course, we know storks don’t deliver babies, and once we control for other factors that create this seemingly causal relationship it disappears entirely – as is the case with the false relationship between right-to-work laws and economic and job growth. In fact, the scientific research actually shows the opposite of what right-to-work proponents have claimed. The most rigorous research study available – published in 2011 by the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute and conducted by Heidi Shierholz (now the chief economist of the US Department of Labor) and Elise Gould – controlled for 42 variables. It found that right-to-work laws result in lower wages and a lower likelihood of health care and pensions for union and non-union workers. It also shows right-to-work laws have no impact on economic growth. Right-to-work proponents, however, have used “research” reports that control for few if any variables, to suggest that right-to-work states have done better on a variety of growth measures, predicting that their state would similarly benefit by passing a bill. For example, the Wisconsin Public Research Institute, a member of the free-market-oriented State Policy Network, published such a report before the state passed its law that claimed that adopting right-to-work could increase per-capita income by 6 percentage points. But the study only controlled for eight variables, which isn’t nearly enough to control for all the different factors that affect changes in income. In other words, the conclusions are meaningless. In the world of medical research, this would be like testing a cancer drug without using a control group that was not given the drug, ensuring that its pure effect could be isolated. Another problem with right-to-work proponents' math is that making predictive arguments using simple averages of other states' growth rates makes no sense statistically. It’s comparable to the argument that on average people with larger shoe sizes are more likely to have heart attacks. Does this mean shoe size predicts heart attacks? No, there are other variables that are having effects such as age – since children are much less likely to have heart attacks. Only regression analysis allows us to isolate the effects of a key variable (storks, shoe size, right-to-work laws) on a given outcome and eliminate the effects of others. The problem with making predictions based on simple averages is easy to see when we examine right-to-work proponents' favorite case – Oklahoma. Gessing told New Mexico lawmakers that Oklahoma’s economic growth is the result of its 2001 right-to-work law. But he failed to mention that over the same period Oklahoma’s economy was benefiting from rising prices for oil and natural gas - and more recently from higher levels of production – factors that would make a significant contribution to growth. Gessing also argues that there are “reams of data” showing right-to-work states create more jobs, which is not true. He didn’t note, for example, that manufacturing employment in Oklahoma fell sharply in the first three years after the state passed its law in 2001 and is currently down about 22% since then. So in the case of Oklahoma, what was likely actually happening? Oil and natural gas made rich people richer through their investments, lifting per-capita personal income but not average worker wages. It is unlikely that right-to-work laws had any impact on Oklahoma’s economic growth. Nor is there convincing evidence that they had an impact on job growth in Michigan and Indiana, as proponents similarly have tried to argue using averages, falling into the shoe size-heart attack trap. Across the country proponents have also argued that right-to-work laws would put their states into consideration for more private sector jobs, a claim for which I cannot find any scientific evidence at all in any state. Instead, they rely on anecdotal examples to make their case. And ultimately, stories about what employers may or may not do in the future if a state were to pass a right-to-work law does not constitute scientific data; there are so many other factors that affect business decisions about where to open a factory or office. Scientific research on the location decisions of US and foreign corporations suggests that among the most important variables are: market size, local taxes, wage rates and transportation infrastructure – but not right-to-work laws. In the 2014 State New Economy Index, which compares states every year for their attractiveness to high-tech, high-wage manufacturers, none of the top five states were right-to-work states, and only two of the top 15 were. What were the companies surveyed looking for? Perhaps surprisingly, they were not looking for cheap labor but rather for states with good education systems, good research universities and skilled workers who would stay for a long time. The debate about right-to-work laws across the country this legislative session has misdirected our collective focus and energy away from what solid evidence suggests will improve states' economic futures: creating a solid infrastructure, equipping our schools and teachers with resources and seeking out emerging and innovative industries that offer better and more permanent jobs. Scientific research also suggests that improving wages and reducing inequality across the US depends on the existence of strong unions. Although right-to-work laws are proffered as part of a state’s economic development strategy, their real goal is to undermine workers' collective voice and power.

Dominion, we have machines now, I do. I have machines, we have ES&S [Election Systems & Software] machines, we got them all and we're going to being putting out so much information over the next couple of weeks,\" Lindell said. Dominion is suing Lindell for $1.3 billion for defaming the company with his conspiracy theories that Trump won the election.The company has reportedly been building a \"legal armada\" for the lawsuit. Lincoln Project senior advisor Jeff Timmer offered his analysis of where the case is headed. \"Lindell is doing his best to ensure Dominion's lawsuit against him will be the first civil case ever to result in the death penalty,\" he joked. Former Southern District of New York prosecutor Richard Signorelli offered his own analysis. \"Lindell may be the first civil defendant to be able to successfully assert an insanity defense,\" he said. Of course, an insanity defense is not allowed in a civil trial, which also can not result in a death penalty. But the jokes highlight the how some are viewing Lindell choosing to continue to push the \"Big Lie\" of election fraud that incited the January 6th insurrection and resulted in Trump's second impeachment.

        "articles": "By Dan Whitcomb (Reuters) - A pro-Democratic redistricting group headed by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder sued Wisconsin's Republican governor, Scott Walker, on Monday for declining to hold special elections for two vacant seats in the state legislature. The National Democratic Redistricting Committee alleged in the lawsuit filed in Dane County Circuit Court that Walker was violating the law and denying Wisconsin voters representation by leaving the elected offices unfilled until 2019. The seats, one in the state Assembly and the other in the state Senate, became vacant in December when two Republican lawmakers resigned to accept jobs in Walker's administration. Democrats quickly called for special elections, hoping to pick up seats, but Walker demurred. Last month, a Democrat won a special election for another Wisconsin state Senate seat that Republicans had held for 17 years. Republicans control both state legislative chambers. \"Governor Scott Walker’s refusal to hold special elections is an affront to representative democracy,\" Holder, who served as attorney general under former Democratic President Barack Obama, said in a statement issued with the lawsuit. \"Forcing citizens to go more than a year without representation in the state legislature is a plain violation of their rights and we’re hopeful the court will act quickly to order the governor to hold elections,\" Holder said. Representatives for Walker, a Republican first elected in 2010 who has been a leading antagonist of Democrats on labor law and other hot-button issues, could not be reached for comment on Monday afternoon. A spokeswoman for Walker, Amy Hasenberg, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his decision to wait to fill the seats was consistent with the law, more practical and a way to save money. \"This D.C.-based special interest group wants to force Wisconsin taxpayers to waste money,\" Hasenberg told the newspaper. \"The Legislature will be adjourned for 2018 before these seats could be filled in special elections, and staff in these offices are working for constituents until new leaders are elected.\" The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which bills itself as an anti-gerrymandering group, seeks to position Democrats favorably for the round of redistricting following the 2020 census, according to the election information website Ballotpedia.

Doug Ducey lifted his executive order on Monday that mandated masks to be worn on Arizona school campuses,\" KPNX-TV reported Monday. \"School districts still have the authority to have mask requirements in their area.\" The station's Brahm Resnik began tracking the response from school districts. Here is the thread he posted to Twitter: Georgia resident Cleveland Meredith Jr., an armed Capitol rioter who threatened to kill Nancy Pelosi, has now pleaded guilty to sending threatening communications and faces up to five years in jail. CNN reports that Meredith, who earlier this year told a judge that he was \"just having fun\" with his deadly threats, is due to be sentenced in December after his guilty plea. On Friday, writing for The New York Times, conservative National Review writer Kevin Williamson outlined how Republicans are still trying to execute former President Donald Trump's coup attempt — and how the Capitol attack on January 6 was only the beginning of the effort. \"As the Republican Party tries to make up its mind between wishing away the events of Jan. 6 or celebrating them, one thing should be clear to conservatives estranged from the party: We can't go home again,\" wrote Williamson. \"The attempted coup's foot soldiers have dug themselves in at state legislatures. For example, last week in Florida State Representative Anthony Sabatini introduced a draft of legislation that would require an audit of the 2020 general election in the state's largest (typically Democratic-heavy) counties, suggesting without basis that it may show that these areas cheated to inflate Joe Biden's vote count.\" As President Joe Biden and health professionals urge Americans to get vaccinated and wear masks, one chiropractor in Pennsylvania is signing exemption forms for anyone seeking to evade public health measures.

        "articles": "A man accidentally shot himself in the arm at a \"Muslim-free\" gun range in Oklahoma. A volunteer group of gun lovers and veterans has been standing guard outside Save Yourself Survival and Tactical Gear in Oktaha after the business owners sent out a Facebook alert claiming they received death threats over their ban on Muslim customers. The man, whose name was not released, dropped his gun -- which fired and struck him in the arm, reported Muskogee Now. The Muskogee County sheriff said he wasn't surprised someone had been hurt by the volunteer patrol after watching them work, comparing the patrols to the fictional clan from \"The Beverly Hillbillies.\" \"I saw several of those gentlemen out there yesterday,\" said Sheriff Charles Pearson. \"The way they were holding their weapons, with the fingers on the triggers, you can tell a couple of these gentlemen have no idea about weapons safety. It's like the Clampetts have come to town.\" One of those volunteers, who claimed to be a combat veteran and would identify himself only as \"Eagle One,\" disputed the sheriff's characterization of the volunteers. \"Don't paint us as ignorant hillbillies,\" he said. \"We just believe in people's constitutional rights, and we're here to make sure they get them.\" The man insisted he held no prejudice against Muslims -- despite volunteering to carry a gun to stop Muslims from attempting to do business inside the gun shop. \"I will fight to the death for someone's right to practice whatever religion they want to,\" the man said. \"I'm not here because of that. I'm here because when people start resorting to violence, we can't allow that.\" The gun shop's owner set up a sign declaring his business a \"Muslim-free establishment\" after an Islamic gunman killed five service members last month at military bases in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Another combat veteran who converted to Islam while serving in the U.S. Navy drove from California to protest the business owner's prohibition. \"I just wanted to come here and express my disapproval,\" said 49-year-old Chris Martin, who served in Operation Desert Storm. \"I'm a veteran, I fought for that right.\" Martin's arrival Tuesday stirred alarm among the armed volunteers, who started to chase the Muslim and his daughter off the property until Eagle One stepped in. \"He's cool,\" Eagle One said, and the other volunteers stood down. The business owner showed up a short time later and asked Martin and reporters to leave the property, which sits across a highway from a convenience store frequented by neighborhood schoolchildren. The store was closed Tuesday after the accidental shooting, which the store owner blamed on faulty equipment. \"The gentleman was a close and personal friend of ours, not a guard nor a customer,\" the store owner said. \"He is a very sweet and dear friend who we consider to be like family. He came over today to help fix a door in my office and as he bent over his weapon fell from a malfunctioning chest holster and went off when it hit the floor.\" The man is expected to recover from his wounds.

        "articles": "According to a report from the Washington Post, there are rumblings within the Republican Party over the fact that Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel is siding too much with Donald Trump over the party as the GOP attempts to regroup following the loss of both the White House and the Senate in the 2020 election. As the report notes, since Trump lost to now-President Joe Biden, the RNC head has gone to extraordinary lengths to remain in Trump's camp by making trips to Mar-a-Lago to consult with him despite the fact he holds no office. The Post's Josh Dawsey wrote, \"Since Trump left office, McDaniel has taken a hands-on approach to staying in Trump's good graces — meeting with him privately at Mar-a-Lago, having the RNC spend more than $100,000 to hold the donor event at his club and regularly conferring with him, even after the deadly Capitol riot on Jan. 6.\" However, as the report explains, her closeness to Trump has some conservatives upset that she is not looking out for the long-term interests of the party while the former president takes potshots at the GOP's leadership. According to the report, the RNC is set to meet next week in Dallas for its first since the election and McDaniel is \"under increasing pressure from some of the committee's members to show more independence from the former president\" after Trump called Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) a \"dumb son of a bitch\" in front of GOP donors in a Mar-a-Lago speech last week. \"While Trump maintains broad support throughout the party, some of the RNC's 168 committee members want to see the party create at least a modicum of distance from Trump — or at least grapple with the fact the GOP lost the White House, Senate and House during his administration and reflect on how to improve its fortunes in 2022 and 2024, according to multiple party officials and committee members,\" the report states with influential Henry Barbour, a national committeeman, bluntly stating: \"We've got to be clear-eyed about the last cycle. We lost.\" Addressing the fact that the RNC paid Trump $100,000 to hold the fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Barbour added, \"Could you imagine if the RNC held a similar event at Ted Cruz's home or Mitt Romney's home or any other potential candidate's home? Trump is a major force in the party, but the party must be bigger than any one candidate, including Donald Trump.\" His view was echoed by Bill Palatucci, a national committeeman from New Jersey, who lamented, \"some of us in purple states sit back and just roll our eyes\" at the goings-on like last week's event. Palatucci went on to add that McDaniel has installed Trump loyalists in key positions within the RNC which doesn't bode well for the future of the party. \"The challenge facing McDaniel and other party officials is that Trump is not retreating from the spotlight, as past presidents have, and has made it clear that he plans to continue to attack other Republicans,\" Dawsey reported. \"For her part, McDaniel has told others that she wants to make sure Trump does not start a third party. And she is conscious that the former president is the \"golden goose\" for fundraising, one person close to her said.\" Added Palatucci, \"Ronna is in a terribly difficult position. She's trying to maintain the donor base, which likes the president, but she's got to navigate a lot of primary fights.\" You can read more here.

        "articles": "There may be more drama afoot at the Bundy militia standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. In a moment of irony, a new group of armed miltiamen has arrived at the standoff in Harney County, Oregon, and the ones that have been there since last Saturday say their presence is unwanted. The Oregonian reports that the Pacific Patriot Network has sent armed \"security\" -- some of whom are carrying semi-automatic rifles -- to the standoff on Saturday. But an attorney mediating the dispute between Ammon Bundy and federal officials said Bundy wants them to leave. \"We don't need that. We don't want it and we're asking you to leave,\" Todd MacFarlane, an attorney mediating the dispute on behalf of the Bundys, told reporters Saturday. In a press conference Saturday morning, a representative from the Bundy group said they are looking to de-escalate the situation. Locals in the area of the standoff have, in turn, condemned the Bundy takeover. Residents have expressed fear at the presence of armed militia and asked the outsiders to leave. MacFarlane said members of the original occupation are \"alarmed\" by the new arrivals. \"This was the last thing in the world they wanted to see happen,\" MacFarlane told reporters. He stressed that Bundy didn't request that the group come, and stressed their presence is unwanted. Brandon Curtiss, leader of the Pacific Patriot Network, said the group will not be staying inside the refuge with the Bundy group, but will be \"patrolling the perimeter,\" according to the Oregonian. The occupation of the bird sanctuary started last week, when Ammon Bundy, son of rancher Cliven Bundy, led the group there after a protest over the imprisonment of ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond. The men have been sentenced to federal prison terms for setting fires on federal property. The Bundy group believes the ranchers' rights are being violated and wants locals to take control over the federal land they are occupying. Cliven Bundy's ranch in Nevada was the focus of a standoff with federal officers last year, after a disagreement over cattle grazing. UPDATE: The Pacific Patriot Network left several hours after arriving, upon request from the Bundy group, ABC news reported. Watch the groups discussing the new arrivals, via the Oregonian, here: Did the Cyber Ninjas botch another attempt to recount Maricopa County's 2020 presidential ballots—an attempt that, so far, has escaped wide media coverage? It appears, at the very least, that a contract signed on July 28 by the Cyber Ninjas—the lead contractor in the Arizona Senate Republicans' election review—and Dr. V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai, a Boston-based technologist and unsuccessful GOP U.S. Senate candidate, indicated that all 2020 election results would be tallied by August—and that deadline has now been missed. On Friday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a federal judge is refusing to release Jacob Chansley, an infamous January 6 Capitol rioter known as the \"QAnon Shaman,\" to St. Louis ahead of his sentencing. \"U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth's order was made public Friday,\" reported Robert Patrick. \"Chansley was required to show by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community, and Lamberth said he failed. Although Chansley's lawyer, Albert Watkins, had arranged for a place for Chansley to stay, with mental health treatment, Watkins failed to show how anyone would prevent Chansley from fleeing the area. Watkins' plan also does not mitigate the possibility that Chansley's supporters would provide him money to flee, the judge said.\" The 9/11 terrorist attacks did not just result in major changes to the U.S. government, but also the press corps. With President George W. Bush banging the drums of war, much of the national press rallied around the flag as Congress voted to invade Afghanistan, pass the Patriot Act, invade Iraq and create the Department of Homeland Security.

The 40-year-old truck mechanic is among 27 militants indicted on federal charges in connection with the armed takeover of Malhuer National Wildlife Refuge in January. His attorneys filed court documents Friday challenging federal jurisdiction because, they argued, the U.S. government cannot prove it owns the land and therefore cannot pay its employees to work there, reported Patch.com. Bundy and the other militants are charged with, among other crimes, interfering with the work of government scientists and others who manage the Oregon nature preserve. Attorney Mike Arnold told the website that Bundy and the other armed men who took over the wildlife refuge were simply \"patriots\" exercising their First Amendment rights. Bundy and his attorneys are asking for a hearing so they can argue that the the Enclave Clause of the Constitution prohibits the U.S. government from owning or managing public lands. That's the same claim made by Koch brothers-backed Republican lawmakers to argue that states or individuals, rather than the federal government, should take over control of public lands. However, experts say case law contradicts that claim. \"The unmistakable legal reality is that a series of solid, indisputable U.S. Supreme Court cases establishes that the federal government is constitutionally empowered to own land, control that land through federal statutes and regulations as it sees fit, and dispose of that land if it chooses to 'without limitation,'\" said Susan Smith, a law professor at Willamette University. She was asked in January, after the occupation began, by the Association of Oregon Counties to research and write about the militants' constitutional interpretations. Other legal experts agree that Bundy and his attorneys will have a difficult time proving their arguments. “We look forward to Ammon Bundy’s attempt to re-litigate 200 years of jurisprudence regarding the property clause, and United States v. Oregon, the 1935 Supreme Court case that specifically established the American people’s ownership of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge,\" said Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Western Priorities. On Friday, The Baltimore Sun reported that a Republican judge in Caroline County, Maryland, is dead in an apparent suicide — discovered when law enforcement officials came to arrest him for possession of illegal child sexual pictures. \"Judge Jonathan G. Newell, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:43 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced. A judge since 2016 and before that Caroline County's top prosecutor for more than a decade, he was to be taken into custody on federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child, prosecutors said,\" reported Justin Fenton. \"A boy that Newell took on a hunting trip on Hoopers Island discovered a hidden camera in the bathroom on July 23, and his parents reported it to police, which The Sun reported last week.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Friday criticized President Joe Biden for ending the war in Afghanistan, which dragged on for two decades. Before taking over Strom Thurmond's seat in the U.S. Senate, Graham voted for the war in Afghanistan as a member of the House of Representatives. The United States may soon hit yet another major milestone in its efforts to vaccinate its citizens against the novel coronavirus. Reuters reports that American regulators could authorize Pfizer's vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 as soon as the end of October. ",

        "articles": "Senior House Financial Services Committee member, Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO) told a conference of bankers Wednesday morning that they needed to \"find a way to neuter\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to Politico. Luetkemeyer was at an American Bankers Association conference in Washington when he made the remark, also calling Warren \"the Darth Vader of the financial services world.\" According to Allied Progress, Luetkemeyer is an old friend to the banking and predatory lending industry, receiving more than $1 million in campaign donations from the industry. He's also scored more than $63,000 from predatory payday lenders which Senator Warren sought to put out of business with a bill she proposed in 2014 that would replace them with the United States Post Office. Nearly one in ten service members end up taking out loans from these sketchy lenders with high interest rates and end up crushed under the weight of debt. \"When these financial predators come after them I feel ashamed for the rest of us,\" Warren said on an episode of \"Taking The Hill.\" Luetkemeyer sponsored HR 766 last year, a bill that would close a Department of Justice (DOJ) effort that targets unscrupulous lending practices. In 2012, he proposed another bill that would weaken oversight of payday lenders by enabling them to skirt the regulatory authority of Warren's previous project the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and state laws that have just as much oversight or stronger. “Rep. Luetkemeyer’s remarks on Senator Elizabeth Warren at the American Bar Association meeting earlier today were offensive, sexist and out-of-line,\" Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of UltraViolet, a women's rights advocacy group, said. \"Comments like these, which sound eerily similar to something that Donald Trump would say, have no place in American politics and speak to the impact that Donald Trump is having on the discourse coming out of the Republican party. Luetkemeyer should immediately apologize to Senator Warren for his offensive language. There is plenty of room for disagreement in Washington, but resorting to sexist name-calling should have no place in our political discourse.” Warren's life's work has been fighting for consumers and against powerful corporations and special interests. Banks have always hated Warren for highlighting weak consumer regulations, working to stop mortgage abuses from lenders and end junk bank fees. Warren crusades onward; her latest has been a collaborative effort to make college more affordable and accessible.

        "articles": "Melanie Tannenbaum at Scientific American has a two-part piece on Donald Trump's appeal (and a third coming) to conservative voters, which I recommend reading in full. But one piece of the first part really struck me as interesting, because it says a lot about the psychological issues behind the culture wars generally. Think back to a time in your life when you and a bunch of other people you knew were on the precipice of a big life change -- maybe your senior year of high school or college, when you and many of your peers were all waiting to find out what jobs you would be entering or what universities you would be attending after graduation. Specifically, think back on those few months when you knew your life would be changing soon, but you didn't quite know yet what that change would specifically entail -- you didn't know which colleges would grant you acceptance, which jobs would offer you an interview, or what opportunities would eventually present themselves. Did you have one friend who embraced that sense of uncertainty, viewing it with a sense of enthusiasm and thrill, excited about the prospect of embarking on an unknown adventure? Did you have another friend who hated every moment of not knowing what would come next, feeling anxious and uneasy until the minute that every single detail of his/her plan had fallen into a definite, guaranteed place? Those two friends likely fell on opposite ends of the spectrum for a personality trait known as ambiguity (or uncertainty) intolerance, and research happens to show that people high in ambiguity intolerance -- those who feel uneasy or anxious in the presence of uncertainty -- are significantly more likely to be politically conservative. As Tannenbaum notes, this explains a lot, particularly when it comes to gender. Her article is focused on positive feelings---how people like Trump because they perceive him as unambiguous---but I'd argue that this theory also explains a lot of negative behavior. A lot of culture war issues stem from what I'd call ambiguity panic, i.e. the hostile \"shut it down\" reaction that many conservatives get when faced with ambiguous situations. As Tannenbaum explains, \"the research showing that people high in ambiguity intolerance feel so profoundly uncomfortable with the idea of uncertainty, they will often prefer a slightly negative yet certain outcome to a potentially-more-positive, uncertain one.\" This, I think, helps explain a lot of disconnect in communication between the right and the left. For liberals, outcome matters more than resolving ambiguity. For conservatives, all too often, ambiguity panic sets in and they focus so much on resolving that discomfort that they can't be bothered to think about long-term outcomes. This helps explain the \"bathroom wars\" over transgender people, for instance. It makes sense that ambiguity intolerance clashes with understanding that some people are trans, though it is aggravating to those of us who have a more flexible understanding of gender. What is a little harder to understand is why it matters so much to conservatives. Denying someone access to the bathroom of their choice has so much potential for negative outcomes. Even putting it that way is a major understatement! I think that Brae Carnes, a trans man who did the #WeJustNeedToPee project where he took selfies in women's bathrooms: The potential negative outcomes for denying someone their rights should absolutely matter more than catering to an ambiguity intolerant person's need to put everyone in neat gender boxes. That's why I think the ugly and hateful reaction to trans people should be seen as a kind of ambiguity panic. It's not just that it's intolerant, but it's about such an over-the-top emotional reaction to not wanting to deal with ambiguity that it crowds out all other considerations, such as treating other people with respect. This story out of Texas also struck me as a perfect illustration of how ambiguity panic shapes so much conservative thinking: The Freedom From Religion Foundation said Friday it filed the complaint against Smith County Court-at-Law Judge Randall Rogers a day earlier with the Texas State Commission on Judicial Conduct in Austin. On July 2, Rogers gave 21-year-old Josten Bundy 30 days to marry 19-year-old Elizabeth James or face 15 days in jail for pleading guilty to misdemeanor assault. Bundy admitted punching Jaynes' ex-boyfriend twice in the jaw for \"saying disrespectful things\" about her. Rogers also ordered Bundy to scrawl a Bible verse 25 times daily. A lot of culture war politics are shaped by the conservative desire, to be blunt, to get everyone married off, especially if they are sexually active. For instance, you see a lot of conservatives pushing this line that getting married is some kind of magic formula that prevents poverty.This theory of ambiguity intolerance helps explain a lot of that. The sexual relationships of unmarried people are seen, by outsiders, as more ambiguous than those of married people. Some are moving towards marriage, some aren't, some may or may not be and the people inside them haven't decided. For the ambiguity intolerant, this can induce a sense of panic: What box do I put your relationship in if it's not \"marriage\"? How do I understand who you two are in relation to each other if you're not husband-and-wife? Argh! This story is just an extreme example of that kind of emotional overreaction. The judge was facing a relatively minor bit of interpersonal violence and instead of just dealing with the task at hand, he got hung up on the fact that there was this couple that said they were in love and yet, somehow, are not married. So he put his need to categorize their relationship over the wellbeing of the people involved. There's a good reason that 21-year-olds rarely marry 19-year-olds these days. That ambiguity of your youth serves you well, allowing you to explore who you are and what you want out of relationships before settling down. But Rogers, panicked at the idea that there are relationships out there he cannot classify easily, was more intent on resolving this situation than preventing negative outcomes that can come from rushing into marriage, like divorce and unhappiness. These are just two examples, but I can think of many other right wing obsessions that are driven by ambiguity panic: Birtherism, \"life begins at conception\", hostility to gay rights, even anti-immigration sentiment, which owes a lot to being uncomfortable with multiculturalism. Georgia resident Cleveland Meredith Jr., an armed Capitol rioter who threatened to kill Nancy Pelosi, has now pleaded guilty to sending threatening communications and faces up to five years in jail. CNN reports that Meredith, who earlier this year told a judge that he was \"just having fun\" with his deadly threats, is due to be sentenced in December after his guilty plea. On Friday, writing for The New York Times, conservative National Review writer Kevin Williamson outlined how Republicans are still trying to execute former President Donald Trump's coup attempt — and how the Capitol attack on January 6 was only the beginning of the effort. \"As the Republican Party tries to make up its mind between wishing away the events of Jan. 6 or celebrating them, one thing should be clear to conservatives estranged from the party: We can't go home again,\" wrote Williamson. \"The attempted coup's foot soldiers have dug themselves in at state legislatures. For example, last week in Florida State Representative Anthony Sabatini introduced a draft of legislation that would require an audit of the 2020 general election in the state's largest (typically Democratic-heavy) counties, suggesting without basis that it may show that these areas cheated to inflate Joe Biden's vote count.\" As President Joe Biden and health professionals urge Americans to get vaccinated and wear masks, one chiropractor in Pennsylvania is signing exemption forms for anyone seeking to evade public health measures. Chiropractor John Dorobish of Cherry Tree Chiropractic in Uniontown was interviewed by WTAE-TV about the state's new mask mandates for schools. ",

Renee Unterman has blocked a bill with bipartisan support that would require law enforcement in the state to account for untested evidence of sexual assaults. Democratic state Rep. Scott Holcomb said that he sponsored House Bill 827 -- or the Pursuing Justice for Rape Victims Act -- because audits had shown that, in some cases, thousands of rape kits had been ignored for years. But Unterman, who chairs the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, said that she would not allow the bill to move forward for a full vote on the Senate floor because it had been \"overly politicized\" by Holcomb, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"If there was a problem, I would be Johnny on the spot and I would have written the legislation,” Unterman insisted. “I think he really overly politicized it in an election year and I’ve got a problem with that.” \"There's no reason to write a law just because it makes you feel good,\" the lawmaker told CBS 46 on Monday. \"I've been asking that representative to show me where the back log is, show me where this rape kits are?\" The progressive group Better Georgia pointed out, however, that the purpose of the bill was to \"require police to account for the backlog of untested rape kits.\" \"Let’s be clear: this bill would not just address the shocking issue of abandoned and untested rape kits; it would guide the process for rape kit collection and testing moving forward,\" the group explained. \"Law enforcement groups, including the GBI and the Prosecuting Attorneys Council, support this bill.

        "articles": "A study published in the journal Neuropsychologia has shown that religious fundamentalism is, in part, the result of a functional impairment in a brain region known as the prefrontal cortex. The findings suggest that damage to particular areas of the prefrontal cortex indirectly promotes religious fundamentalism by diminishing cognitive flexibility and openness—a psychology term that describes a personality trait which involves dimensions like curiosity, creativity, and open-mindedness. Religious beliefs can be thought of as socially transmitted mental representations that consist of supernatural events and entities assumed to be real. Religious beliefs differ from empirical beliefs, which are based on how the world appears to be and are updated as new evidence accumulates or when new theories with better predictive power emerge. On the other hand, religious beliefs are not usually updated in response to new evidence or scientific explanations, and are therefore strongly associated with conservatism. They are fixed and rigid, which helps promote predictability and coherence to the rules of society among individuals within the group. Religious fundamentalism refers to an ideology that emphasizes traditional religious texts and rituals and discourages progressive thinking about religion and social issues. Fundamentalist groups generally oppose anything that questions or challenges their beliefs or way of life. For this reason, they are often aggressive towards anyone who does not share their specific set of supernatural beliefs, and towards science, as these things are seen as existential threats to their entire worldview. Since religious beliefs play a massive role in driving and influencing human behavior throughout the world, it is important to understand the phenomenon of religious fundamentalism from a psychological and neurological perspective. To investigate the cognitive and neural systems involved in religious fundamentalism, a team of researchers—led by Jordan Grafman of Northwestern University—conducted a study that utilized data from Vietnam War Veterans that had been gathered previously. The vets were specifically chosen because a large number of them had damage to brain areas suspected of playing a critical role in functions related to religious fundamentalism. CT scans were analyzed comparing 119 vets with brain trauma to 30 healthy vets with no damage, and a survey that assessed religious fundamentalism was administered. While the majority of participants were Christians of some kind, 32.5% did not specify a particular religion. Based on previous research, the experimenters predicted that the prefrontal cortex would play a role in religious fundamentalism, since this region is known to be associated with something called ‘cognitive flexibility’. This term refers to the brain’s ability to easily switch from thinking about one concept to another, and to think about multiple things simultaneously. Cognitive flexibility allows organisms to update beliefs in light of new evidence, and this trait likely emerged because of the obvious survival advantage such a skill provides. It is a crucial mental characteristic for adapting to new environments because it allows individuals to make more accurate predictions about the world under new and changing conditions. Brain imaging research has shown that a major neural region associated with cognitive flexibility is the prefrontal cortex—specifically two areas known as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Additionally, the vmPFC was of interest to the researchers because past studies have revealed its connection to fundamentalist-type beliefs. For example, one study showed individuals with vmPFC lesions rated radical political statements as more moderate than people with normal brains, while another showed a direct connection between vmPFC damage and religious fundamentalism. For these reasons, in the present study, researchers looked at patients with lesions in both the vmPFC and the dlPFC, and searched for correlations between damage in these areas and responses to religious fundamentalism questionnaires. According to Dr. Grafman and his team, since religious fundamentalism involves a strict adherence to a rigid set of beliefs, cognitive flexibility and open mindedness present a challenge for fundamentalists. As such, they predicted that participants with lesions to either the vmPFC or the dlPFC would score low on measures of cognitive flexibility and trait openness and high on measures of religious fundamentalism. The results showed that, as expected, damage to the vmPFC and dlPFC was associated with religious fundamentalism. Further tests revealed that this increase in religious fundamentalism was caused by a reduction in cognitive flexibility and openness resulting from the prefrontal cortex impairment. Cognitive flexibility was assessed using a standard psychological card sorting test that involved categorizing cards with words and images according to rules. Openness was measured using a widely-used personality survey known as the NEO Personality Inventory. The data suggests that damage to the vmPFC indirectly promotes religious fundamentalism by suppressing both cognitive flexibility and openness. These findings are important because they suggest that impaired functioning in the prefrontal cortex—whether from brain trauma, a psychological disorder, a drug or alcohol addiction, or simply a particular genetic profile—can make an individual susceptible to religious fundamentalism. And perhaps in other cases, extreme religious indoctrination harms the development or proper functioning of the prefrontal regions in a way that hinders cognitive flexibility and openness. The authors emphasize that cognitive flexibility and openness aren’t the only things that make brains vulnerable to religious fundamentalism. In fact, their analyses showed that these factors only accounted for a fifth of the variation in fundamentalism scores. Uncovering those additional causes, which could be anything from genetic predispositions to social influences, is a future research project that the researchers believe will occupy investigators for many decades to come, given how complex and widespread religious fundamentalism is and will likely continue to be for some time. By investigating the cognitive and neural underpinnings of religious fundamentalism, we can better understand how the phenomenon is represented in the connectivity of the brain, which could allow us to someday inoculate against rigid or radical belief systems through various kinds of mental and cognitive exercises.

But a new report from The New York Times says that it was a case of mistaken identity that killed a U.S.-allied aid worker along with other innocent people. \"Military officials said they did not know the identity of the car's driver when the drone fired, but deemed him suspicious because of how they interpreted his activities that day, saying that he possibly visited an ISIS safe house and, at one point, loaded what they thought could be explosives into the car,\" the Times reports. In a 2018 interview with Lisa Luckett, whose husband Teddy worked and died in the World Trade Center building on September 11, 2001, Luckett told Salon one memory she never wants to forget from that horrific day was the \"beauty,\" \"grace,\" \"compassion,\" and \"incredible strength of the human spirit\" that followed. \"I never expected people to show up for me,\" Luckett said. Yet they did. CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale has debunked a viral video making false claims of mass walkouts by active duty service members who are refusing to get vaccinated.

        "articles": "In an interview with Sandra Smith from Fox News, a Nebraska farmer swatted down her contention that a Keystone XL pipeline President Donald Trump wants to revive will put America on the road to energy independence. Nebraska farmer Art Tanderup farms outside of Neligh (population 1,599 recorded by the 2010 census) and would be affected by the pipeline. Tanderup explained to Fox News viewers that Keystone XL would only travel through America, allowing Canadian Tar Sands to be exported from North America. \"But it’s going across America to be refined and exported, which is not for America’s use,” Tanderup explained. “If they do not mix some high-quality crude with this, the best they get is poor-grade diesel fuel, which we can’t even burn in this country.” For years, Art Tanderup has been a burr in the saddle of TransCanada Corporation efforts to build the pipeline. In 2014, Tanderup traveled to Washington, DC as part of the Cowboy Indian Alliance against the KXL pipeline and his farm hosted a 10,000 attendee concert with artists Neil Young and Willie Nelson.
