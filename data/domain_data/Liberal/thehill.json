        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Today, thousands of people assembled in streets around the world to protest the presidency of Donald J. Trump for the fourth straight day in a row. While the vast majority of the protests have been peaceful, spurts of violence have drawn the attention of the media. Reports of protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police in Santa Ana, stories of property destruction in Oregon, and a video of a physical attack against a Trump supporter in Chicago are a few examples of the recorded violent reactions to Trump’s election. President-elect Trump responded to the demonstrations by tweeting: Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! Trump’s supporters also perceive these protests as “unfair” because they claim there were no riots following Obama’s election. However, these perceptions do not reflect what actually followed the election of our country’s first black president, much less the difference between why people are protesting Donald J. Trump’s presidency as compared to Barack ObamaBarack Hussein ObamaScott Brown's wife files to run for Congress Why a slower start can benefit a new president Biden to stump for Newsom on Monday during western swing MORE’s presidency. Obama’s election in 2008 was preceded and followed by violent attacks and property destruction targeted against minorities. Kaylon Johnson, an African American campaign worker for Obama, was physically assaulted for wearing an Obama T-shirt in Louisiana following the 2008 election. The three white male attackers shouted “Fuck Obama!” and “Nigger president!” as they broke Johnson’s nose and fractured his eye-socket, requiring surgery. More frequently, Obama’s presidency was marked by effigies of our first black president hanging from nooses across the country, for example in Kentucky, Washington State, and Maine, or being burned around the world. What Trump supporters fail to remember is that following Obama’s election, property was destroyed across the country, for example in Pennsylvania, Texas, and North Carolina, and a predominately black church was torched in Massachusetts. In 2008, anti-Obama protesters lashed out against minorities because of their discontentment with a black man being voted into the office of president for the first time in our nation’s history. Conversely, in 2016, anti-Trump protesters are holding mostly peaceful demonstrations because of their discontentment with a man, who has ostracized minorities, being voted into the office of president. And while anti-Trump protesters have engaged in mostly peaceful demonstrations against the president-elect, pro-Trump supporters have been responsible for a wave of attacks against Muslims, Latinos, blacks, and the LGBT community. According to Mark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center civil rights group, there haven’t been “such a rash of hate crimes in the United States since Barack Obama was elected America’s first black president in 2008.” Muslim women are reporting having their hijabs ripped from their heads, while immigrant children are being bullied. Trump’s name and slogan, “Make America Great Again,” are being found alongside swastikas and anti-minority messages in graffiti around the nation. Ultimately, demonstrators are not protesting Trump because he is Republican. They aren’t protesting him because he is a white male. These protests are because of the bigotry his campaign has emboldened and the fear of discrimination his presidency has the capacity to perpetuate.

The polling reportedly showed Trump behind Biden in a number of the states he needs to take to win reelection, though the Times report did not identify them. “No one has ever asked us to lie about anything,\" a Trump campaign official told The Hill in a statement on Tuesday. \"The poll in question shows President Trump beating a defined Democrat opponent.” Beyond Trump's internal polling, a series of recent surveys have shown the president trailing Biden in several important states. Last week, a Quinnipiac University poll found Biden 4 points ahead of Trump in Texas, a state Democrats haven't won in the presidential election since 1976. A different poll released last week found Trump trailing Biden and several other 2020 Democrats in Michigan, a state he narrowly won in 2016. Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to win Michigan and Pennsylvania since 1988. He also won Wisconsin, the first time a Republican had taken that state since 1984.

Trump has been focused on Biden, who has been the front-runner in the Democratic campaign so far. He and Biden will both be campaigning on Tuesday in Iowa, which will host the first caucuses early next year. --This report was updated at 11:25 a.m. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved While the radical right rejoices over the victory in the Alabama Republican Senate primary of Roy Moore, who advocates mass impeachment of federal judges who do not put his theological conservatism over the Constitution in their rulings, the eyes of Alabama and the nation now turn to Doug Jones, his Democratic opponent in the Dec. 12 election. Jones is an enormously qualified and appealing candidate who was born in Fairfield, Ala., and worked in the Senate for the widely respected former Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.). He was named U.S. attorney by President Bill ClintonWilliam (Bill) Jefferson ClintonDemocrats hit crunch time for passing Biden agenda Lewinsky says Bill Clinton 'should want to apologize' We need Biden's economic plan to rebuild the middle class MORE and confirmed by a Republican Senate. As U.S. attorney, Jones successfully prosecuted two members of the Ku Klux Klan for their role in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing decades earlier, in 1963. He also served as court-appointed special general master in a major environmental clean-up case in Alabama. Doug Jones has a chance of defeating Moore in the December election because his appeal and credibility are so strong, and Moore’s politics are so extreme, that there will be some moderate Republicans, centrist Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who will quietly vote for Jones or refuse to vote for Moore on Election Day. While Jones is an underdog in the race, he has a fighting chance to win because special elections are notorious for low turnout numbers. In the primary this week that nominated Moore, only 14 percent of voters turned out. If general election turnout by supporters of Jones is above average for a special election, and the number of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who refuse to support Moore is above average, which is likely, Jones could pull off a shocker in a squeaker. My hope is that the gigantic number of patriotic small donors who care deeply about the future of Alabama and America will now begin a massive surge of small donations to the Jones campaign. My message to patriotic small donors and socially enlightened larger donors is to move now, move fast and move decisively to give Jones a powerful lift beginning today. Every group that would be hurt by Moore’s election, and lifted if Jones is elected, will be communicating to their members and supporters in Alabama that they must vote on Election Day. Will black voters who have huge stakes in this election provide a surge of voter turnout? Will seniors and others who would be devastated by Moore’s reactionary views of health care, and lifted by the election of Jones, vote in larger than average numbers on Dec. 12? Will working people, who have much to gain because Jones supports the higher minimum wage and equal pay for women that Moore opposes, be inspired to vote for Jones? Many will, and if enough do, Jones can win. To paraphrase a famous saying, it’s the turnout, stupid. Those who oppose the dark vision of politics that Moore represents, and support the unifying vision that Jones stands for, have it within their power to elect Jones on Dec. 12 if they care enough to vote and fight hard enough to win. Doug Jones has spent a lifetime battling for the values of our Pledge of Allegiance, which reads: “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” For voters who want an indivisible nation, where we are united with each other rather than divided against each other, their candidate is Doug Jones, not Roy Moore. For voters who want the bells of liberty and justice to ring for every citizen regardless of race, religion or gender, their candidate is Doug Jones, not Roy Moore. For all who are appalled and disgusted by the repellant direction our politics has taken, they have the power to take a stand and change the world by confounding the experts, defeating Roy Moore and electing Doug Jones.

Story at a glance Allen Russel, a 38-year-old Black man, will still serve a life sentence for possession of marijuana after a Mississippi Appeals Court upheld his sentence. Under Mississippi state law, the possession of 1.05 to 8.8 ounces of marijuana can hold a sentence of up to three years, a $3,000 fine, or both, according to the Associated Press. America is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news. Russell was reportedly in possession of five bags of marijuana when he was arrested in 2017, and two of the five bags contained 1.5 ounces. Russell’s life sentence was upheld by the state appeals court because of his status as a “habitual offender.” Mississippi law permits a life sentence for habitual offenders if the offender served a year in prison for two individual felonies and if one of the felonies was a violent offense. Russell served more than eight years in prison for two home burglaries and an additional two years for the unlawful possession of a firearm, according to the Mississippi Court of Appeals ruling.

Nearly a quarter of the entities have not been previously reported. Sixty patrons who promoted specific interests to the Trump administration spent almost $12 million on expenses associated with the Trump Organization during the first two years of Trump’s presidency. The Times reported nearly all of these customers saw their interests move forward. In interviews with almost 250 business executives, club members, lobbyists, Trump property employees and current administration officials, sources detailed to the Times how Trump conducted business and interacted with customers who were seeking help from the administration. The newspaper also used Trump’s tax return data, lobbying disclosures, Freedom of Information Act requests and other public records to construct a database of groups, companies and governments that had business before the administration and spent money at Trump properties. The Trump Organization’s customers included foreign politicians, Florida barons, a Chinese billionaire, a Serbian prince, clean-energy advocates, petroleum industry leaders, small-government advocates and contractors. The newspaper noted that some of the president’s customers did not see their interests fully fulfilled but noted “whether they won or lost, Mr. Trump benefited financially.” More than 70 advocacy groups, businesses and foreign governments held events at Trump Organization properties that previously were at different locations or developed new events to be hosted at the properties. Religious organizations also participated by throwing prayer meetings, banquets and tours on Trump properties. At least two dozen patrons who reserved events for 2017 and 2018 at Trump properties had interests involving the administration. The analysis also found that more than 100 companies that sought action from the federal government spent money at Trump properties. Many of the patrons to Trump's businesses told the Times that any favorable outcome they received from the administration was incidental to their use of Trump's properties. The Times noted that the tax records do not include all payments to Trump properties, but additional data is tracked by the town of Palm Beach, Fla., where Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club is located. Organizations that had special interests reported spending $3.3 million on events at the club from 2017 to now. The records and membership rosters for Mar-a-Lago and Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N.J., also show how much money his business was making once he sat in the White House. Being a member of his clubs also allowed leaders to get time with the president and sometimes his support, as he offered ambassadorships to five members and chose others for advisory roles in his administration. White House spokesperson Judd Deere told The Hill in a statement that the Times report was “just more fake news.” “This is yet another politically-motivated hit piece inaccurately smearing a standard business deal,” he said. “During his years as a successful businessman, Donald Trump was long-time partners with Phil Ruffin and earned whatever payments he received. This is the same 2016 playbook that the American people rejected resoundingly.” Deere told the Times in a statement that the president “turned over the day-to-day responsibilities” of the Trump Organization to his two adult sons.

Surely those remarks couldn't have taken Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonHoward Stern rips vaccine opponents: 'F--- their freedom, I want my freedom to live' New Hampshire Democrat wins GOP-held state House seat Clinton thrilled to have Joan Allen recording her new book MORE by surprise. They were consistent with the central theme of the Sanders campaign. Clinton would no doubt like the electorate to believe that the tirade that followed was spontaneous. It is highly probable that what we saw and heard that night was nothing more than an adroit performance. Her indignation was transparently feigned. Her \"artful smear\" remark was a punchline: an application of the strategy that the best defense is a good offense. Clinton went into the New Hampshire debate still smarting from her surprisingly inept performance at the Nov. 14, 2015 CBS Democratic Debate. Previously, she had been caught flat-footed. Sanders and CBS moderator John Dickerson raised questions about her receipt of millions of dollars from Wall Street in campaign donations and \"speaking fees.\" Clinton responded with what Slate's Ben Mathis-Lilly described as \"a non-sequitur\" -- 9/11. Let's get real. Through the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, Congress erected an impenetrable firewall between commercial and investment banks. It was designed to shield commercial bank depositors from high-risks speculative ventures.

According to economist Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate, that repeal not only facilitated \"too big to fail\" but expanded the high-risk and all too often fraudulent behaviors that brought the world's financial system to the brink of collapse in 2008. Both Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth WarrenElizabeth WarrenScott Brown's wife files to run for Congress Schiff calls on Amazon, Facebook to address spread of vaccine misinformation Yellen triggers alarm bells over debt ceiling cliff MORE (D-Mass.) concur with Stiglitz assessment. Sanders's plan for Wall Street contains three major components: (1) Reinstate Glass-Steagall, (2) end \"too big to fail\" by breaking up the big banks, and (3) impose a tax on Wall Street speculation that would \"discourage short-term gambling.\" During the debates, Clinton, who opposes reinstatement of Glass-Steagall, made the bald claim that her \"reforms\" would be tougher on Wall Street than Sanders's -- a contention that has been refuted by 170 of this nation's top economists: Secretary Hillary Clinton’s more modest proposals do not go far enough. They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking. As a result, her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans. Given the size and political power of Wall Street, her proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. As Thomas Jefferson recognized when he penned the Declaration of Independence, the legitimacy of any government is contingent upon the \"consent of the governed.\" Consent is meaningless unless it is \"informed.\" An opposing candidate not only has the right but an obligation to educate the public as to matters that have a direct bearing on their ultimate decision as to who would best serve their interests. The public has a right to know that four of the top five firms that had furnished campaign contributions to Clinton over the course of her political career are the same Wall Street banks and investment firms whose exponential growth was facilitated by the repeal of Glass-Steagall. The public is also entitled to know that, after she resigned as secretary of state, Bill and Hillary Clinton received more than $25 million in speaking fees in just 14 months. When placed in this context, Clinton's claim that her proposals are tougher on Wall Street than those advanced by Sanders and Warren make no sense. Clinton would have the American electorate believe that Wall Street has donated millions of dollars to her campaign because they want a president who will crack down harder on their fraudulent schemes?

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Federal prosecutors appear to be zeroing in on the Oath Keepers following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, making the paramilitary group a priority among the more than 400 people facing criminal charges over the rampage. A dozen co-defendants reportedly affiliated with the right-wing militia organization are facing conspiracy and other charges over their alleged roles in the storming of the Capitol. Last week, another member of the Oath Keepers, Jon Ryan Schaffer, became the first defendant following Jan. 6 to plead guilty and agree to cooperate with law enforcement. Legal experts believe that cooperation will be essential for federal prosecutors to build upon their cases against other members who are facing charges or go after bigger fish who may have played a role in instigating the mayhem, which overran the Capitol and included at least five deaths. The conspiracy charges could indicate a focus on the organization as a whole — which could lead to charges against Oath Keeper members who never made it to the Capitol that day. “It means they’re not treating these people as individuals anymore. They’re trying to go after networks and organizations, which is a totally different strategy and also reflects the recognition that this is no longer a problem of random lone wolves being radicalized on the internet. We’re talking about groups engaging in violent activities that they are going to pursue, and that is fascinating,” said Katrina Mulligan, a national security expert with the Center for American Progress. “This allows you to go after not just individuals and leaders that weren't there but the entities themselves, so you can go after their money,” she added. Schaffer’s plea comes as the group, which includes Jessica Marie Watkins, Thomas Caldwell and Donovan Crowl, is facing some of the most serious charges that have been brought against any of the accused rioters, with prosecutors alleging that the 12 conspired to \"stop, delay and hinder Congress's certification of the Electoral College vote.\" The New York Times reported last month that the Justice Department is also considering adding sedition charges against the group. Christopher Macchiaroli, a former federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., and Florida, says that building those cases will require a similar approach to what the Department of Justice (DOJ) uses to take on organized crime. \"This organization isn't anywhere close to a kind of criminal organization like the Mafia, MS-13 or anything like that,\" Macchiaroli said. \"This is really an organization that, you know, has engaged allegedly in a criminal act. And they are therefore establishing the conspiracy for that criminal act, which makes it much more important to have a cooperator from the inside to kind of explain what was being done for this specific crime in the sense of planning or knowledge or intent or anything like that because you have an organization that is not criminal at its core but engaged in a criminal act,\" he added. Federal prosecutors say that the group of alleged conspirators coordinated an operation on Jan. 6 intended to disrupt the Electoral College certification. Court documents allege that they donned “paramilitary gear” and suggested in online communications that they had arranged an armed “quick reaction force” to be ready nearby. The Oath Keepers is a right-wing militia organization with chapters across the country that espouses anti-government beliefs. It claims to have about 30,000 members, though that number is disputed, and to be comprised primarily of current and former military, law enforcement and first responders. The group began garnering national attention over the past decade when its members showed up, often heavily armed, at right-wing demonstrations and to \"provide security\" in cities facing protests against police brutality. Its leaders and members have broadly expressed loyalty to former President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE and rallied in support of him following last year's election, helping spread baseless claims of widespread electoral fraud that delivered the White House to President BidenJoe BidenKentucky state lawmakers vote to scrap school mask mandate Arkansas governor pushes back against Biden's vaccine mandate RNC vows to sue over Biden vaccine, testing mandate MORE. Stewart Rhodes, the founder and leader of the Oath Keepers, urged people to flock to the Capitol for pro-Trump rallies in the days leading up to the riot, promising to \"help keep Trump supporters safe.\" \"It is CRITICAL that all patriots who can be in DC get to DC to stand tall in support of President Trump’s fight to defeat the enemies foreign and domestic who are attempting a coup, through the massive vote fraud and related attacks on our Republic,\" Rhodes wrote in Jan. 4 blog post on the group's website. \"We Oath Keepers are both honor-bound and eager to be there in strength to do our part.\" Freddy Cruz, a research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center, says Rhodes has a lot of influence in the right-wing anti-government movement. According to Cruz, Rhodes has helped imbue the Oath Keepers with conspiracy theories about the federal government and used them to motivate and recruit members. “What Stewart Rhodes tries to do is recruit former veterans with this idea that they're upholding their oath to the Constitution by challenging laws and policies that they consider unconstitutional,” Cruz told The Hill. “What Rhodes often says is that they are defenders of the Constitution and therefore they are able to challenge laws that are in his view unconstitutional,” he added. The New York Times reported last month that the DOJ is investigating Rhodes, though he has not been charged with anything. He apparently did not enter the Capitol during the riot, but according to court documents filed by federal prosecutors, he was in contact with Oath Keepers members, including at least two who have been charged with conspiracy, throughout the insurrection. Rhodes did not respond to a message seeking comment. Some of the group’s members are already trying to distance themselves from him. \"I want to congratulate Stewart Rhodes and his 10 militia buddies for winning first place in the ultimate dumbass contest because that's what it was,\" Jim Arroyo, the vice president of the Oath Keepers Arizona chapter, told \"60 Minutes\" last week. \"That goes against everything we've ever taught, everything we believe in. It was preplanned. It was prestaged. Ten guys go and do something stupid, and suddenly we're the devil.\" Schaffer’s cooperation carries other practical implications for the investigation, particularly as prosecutors have complained that encrypted messaging apps can make it difficult to follow internal communications. “From the outside, if you’re trying to get into a closed network — drug conspiracy, the mob, the Proud Boys — you can try to intercept communications, you can try to tap a phone and get text messages, but you might not be getting it, because you don't know what form of communication they’re using,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. “And that's something a cooperator will tell you, how and what form of communications they were using, which will allow you to go get those through warrants or subpoenas,” he added. Schaffer's flip could also spur other Oath Keepers members to cooperate with investigators, though Osler warned they may want to hurry. Deals are cut only with those who can provide “substantial assistance” to the government, a factor that tends to diminish with additional witnesses. Observers are also curious about whether the plea deal and any subsequent flips reveal further ties between the Oath Keepers and other far-right groups. “What will be truly illuminating as things progress forward, and as evidence gleaned from Mr. Schaffer no doubt results in some of his colleagues entering into similar cooperation plea deals to save their own skin, is whether sedition charges ultimately are pursued against the senior players in these groups,” Bradley Moss, a national security law expert, told The Hill by email. It remains unclear whether federal prosecutors intend to bring charges against any additional Oath Keepers members and how the scrutiny will impact the group. Cruz said that the group was very active throughout 2020, with members showing up to Trump rallies and counterdemonstrating against Black Lives Matter rallies, “but since January, since we haven't seen any sort of organized or coordinated Oath Keepers event calling on members to descend upon the city or try and put some kind of counterprotest together.” Macchiaroli, the former federal prosecutor, said that federal law enforcement investigations can have a damaging effect on organizations under scrutiny, and that effect could be amplified for a group that’s as conspiracy-minded as the Oath Keepers. “If I was a member, the first thing I would do is disappear,” he said. “I'd stop attending meetings. I'd stop communicating with people.” View the discussion thread.

Say goodbye to Jeb, George and family. The Eastern Establishment today, pressing them forward beyond their times, recalls the record industry in the early Sixties pushing Perry Como and Andy Williams when the Beatles had landed. Bernie and The Donald are icons of new beginnings going smash-mouth against the tradition. Bill MaherWilliam (Bill) MaherPsaki defends move to oust Trump appointees from military academy boards Maher: Afghanistan shows 'woke' Americans 'what real oppression looks like' Bill Maher on chaotic Afghan withdrawal: 'Could it be more Trumpian?' MORE correctly says that Trump is the anti-Romney; that he brushes things off. Former Republican nominee Mitt Romney might be seen as the more authentic standard of a conservative tradition, while the Clintons and Bushes are merely nostálgicos; agents of past irrelevant to the present and future, who won't let go. But with Trump, conservatives today might be seen as transcending the \"authentic standard\" of Romney's balance for a new beginning. The same should be said for Sanders and the Democrats: Picture the historic cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in which the old Beatles are pictured as Madame Tussauds wax dummies at their own funeral at the bottom, and the new Beatles rising in colorful creation for a new dance of awakening above. The Democrats might visualize their own Madame Tussauds wax figures today as Bill and Hillary, the Republicans with the three Bushes. But surely a great awakening is ahead for liberals and conservatives both, as it was back then for America, and Sanders and Trump are avatars of the rising awakenings. But it does not mean that Sanders and Trump will go to the finish line and although their rise will continue — Sanders should pull crowds of up to 100,000 by Thanksgiving — their roles in time may be seen as inspiring new political and cultural collectivities: Conservatism is entering a creative metamorphosis. It is impossible to see who will rise with it as it hasn't been created yet. But it is not that difficult to see who the rising agent will be in the lineup of 17 or so who want to be president. In my opinion, next to Trump, no one in that lineup can compete with Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard. She is the anti-politician who follows in Trump's wake once the comet passes. Similarly, Democrats face a great awakening ahead as the old water carriers are sent off to the wax museum of time past and forgotten. Sanders leads the way. But there is something missing from this picture. Where is the Democrats' own Fiorina? That surely is Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth WarrenElizabeth WarrenScott Brown's wife files to run for Congress Schiff calls on Amazon, Facebook to address spread of vaccine misinformation Yellen triggers alarm bells over debt ceiling cliff MORE. She is now and has been, since the first time she appeared in the public limelight, the new and sparkling visionary, bristling with animation, who will bring liberals forward. Trump and Fiorina bring forth a kind of yin and yang from which, in the Tao tradition, the 10,000 things that are brought forth can make the world again. Sanders by himself is not enough. He needs Warren. History at this moment, after eight years of a very popular and able president — thankfully a normal person, a gifted person and one to fulfill a specific destiny in America's unique racial history — would tend to favor Republicans. Democrats need more than Sanders. They need to build a new political culture post-Obama, post-Clinton, post-Kennedy. Warren, with Sanders, would be the creative basis for that new beginning. Consider the fall, then the spring with a new Democratic lineup starring Sanders, Warren, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. It forms a fully created quaternity in which the world, as we know it in this new millennium, can begin again for the Democrats. Conservatives, thanks to The Donald, have already left the Bush nostálgicos behind. They are ahead of the Democrats in this. The Democrats, as quickly as possible, need to put the past behind them and that past, fraught with discord, malfeasance and corruption, is the Clintons. Then start again with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Warren is the key. For the Democrats' future, she is the key to everything.

The Hill has reached out to the White House for comment. The New York Times report comes a day after The Wall Street Journal reported that an attorney for Cohen raised the idea of a possible pardon with Trump attorneys following the FBI's raid of his home and office. Stephen Ryan allegedly discussed the possibility of a pardon with Jay Sekulow, Giuliani and Joanna Hendon in the weeks following the FBI's raid of Cohen's home, hotel room and office while the group reviewed seized files that may have qualified for attorney-client privilege. Cohen is currently awaiting a three-year prison sentence over charges of bank and tax fraud and campaign finance violations related to payments he made to women alleging to have had affairs with Trump. During testimony to the House Oversight and Reform Committee last week, Cohen expressed that he \"never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from Mr. Trump.\" Cohen's lawyer and spokesperson, Lanny Davis, also has rejected the possibility of his client accepting a pardon from the president. The president initially defended his longtime attorney after an FBI raid of his home and office but in recent months has directed a wave of criticism aimed at Cohen's credibility.

Democrats are seen as heavy favorites to take back control of the House.

The reported filing with the East Hampton Police Department came after Cuomo shared a story on his SiriusXM radio show on Monday about a \"jackass, loser biker\" who got in his \"space\" because he was in the front yard with two women and three children at the home, which is still under construction. The bicyclist told the Post that Cuomo had purchased the property. The Cuomo family is currently living in nearby Southampton, where the anchor and host has been broadcasting from his basement while under quarantine. Cuomo announced on March 31 that he had tested positive for coronavirus, prompting an outpouring of support from media members and viewers of his CNN prime-time program. The 49-year-old said as recently as Tuesday night that he is still suffering from a low-grade fever. Two weeks after first testing positive for coronavirus, @chriscuomo shares an update on how his battle is progressing: “My body is not ready until it’s ready.” pic.twitter.com/9dP6q6vEbZ The Long Island bicyclist, a 65-year-old man who only identified himself as David, told the Post he decided to file a police report to document the alleged incident in case he feels \"that this guy’s a threat to me.\" The bicyclist told the Post he's lived in East Hampton for most of his life. David said the verbal confrontation occurred after he saw Cuomo outside on Sunday. \"I just looked and said, ‘Is that Chris Cuomo? Isn’t he supposed to be quarantined?'” David said after one of the two women there approached him. \"I said to him, ‘Your brother is the coronavirus czar, and you’re not even following his rules — unnecessary travel.'\" \"'Who the hell are you?! I can do what I want!' He just ranted, screaming, ‘I’ll find out who you are!’\" Cuomo responded, according to David. \"He said, ‘This is not the end of this. You’ll deal with this later. We will meet again.’ If that’s not a threat, I don’t know what is,\" David added. Cuomo talked about the back-and-forth on his SiriusXM program, \"Let's Get After It,\" on Monday while explaining that being a public figure prevents him from firing back at people talking \"bullshit\" to him. \"I want to be able to tell you to go to hell, to shut your mouth,\" Cuomo said. \"I don’t get that doing what I do for a living, me being able to tell you to shut your mouth or I will do you the way you guys do each other.\" “I don’t want some jackass, loser, fat-tire biker being able to pull over and get in my space and talk bullshit to me, I don’t want to hear it,” he added. The Hill has reached out to the East Hampton Police Department. SiriusXM referred The Hill to CNN for comment. Cuomo joined CNN in 2013 as a morning anchor before earning a prime-time show in 2018, with the program quickly becoming the top-rated show on the network in its 9 p.m. slot.

Daleiden told reporters after posting a $3,000 bond at the Harris County courthouse that he is grateful for the backing of his supporters. His attorneys maintained Daleiden's innocence, casting the actions of their client as no different from investigative journalists and describing the case as a \"miscarriage of justice.\" Daleiden and a group of abortion opponents were also slated to deliver more than 100,000 signatures to the district attorney calling for the charges against Daleiden and parter Sandra Merritt to be dropped. Daleiden and Merritt were indicted last month on charges of tampering with government records. Daleiden was also charged on a count relating to the purchase of human organs. Merritt turned herself in to authorities earlier this week and is also out on bond.

All Rights Reserved The Ku Klux Klan is holding a rally next month on the grounds of the South Carolina Statehouse in support of the Confederate flag, amid calls to remove the controversial symbol following a mass shooting at a black church. A local chapter, the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan from Pelham, N.C., will hold the rally on July 18, according to local media reports. That date is just one month and a day after nine were killed in a shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. Dylann Roof, the alleged shooter, reportedly confessed to killing the congregants after a Bible study, telling police he wanted to start a race war. In the wake of the tragedy, pictures have emerged of him posing with the Confederate flag and a gun. Roof’s association with the flag sparked a movement to remove it from the Statehouse grounds. Gov.

If the bill moves through the Legislature quickly, the flag could be gone by the time of the rally. The Confederate battle flag used to fly over the Capitol dome but now flies at a Confederate memorial on the grounds as part of a compromise that also created an African-American history monument. The Loyal White Knights’ website has a home page devoted to the Confederate flags, where it argues that efforts to remove it are “cultural genocide.” “If you can't tell they are trying to wipe us out of the history books. ... Tell this cultural Marxist government they better not dare to dishonor our ancestors [sic] graves,” the website says. Another section describing its activities says Klan rallies are “family events” and that all events are restricted to “whites only.” The First Amendment’s free assembly provision typically protects the right of groups to protest, and governments can only place simple, content-neutral restrictions on rallies.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Planned Parenthood on Thursday filed a long-awaited federal lawsuit against the anti-abortion activists who have targeted the group with undercover videos for the last year. The formal complaint marks the first time that Planned Parenthood has taken legal action against the group, the Center for Medical Progress. In response, Daleiden released a statement that said “game on.” “I look forward to deposing all the CEOs, Medical Directors, and their co-conspirators who participated in Planned Parenthood's illegal baby body parts racket,” he said. Daleiden, who has become a national figure in the abortion debate this year, has released 10 videos featuring secretly recorded footage of Planned Parenthood staff members discussing fetal tissue donated from abortions. The footage includes clips of at least one conversation in which a Planned Parenthood official discusses the amount of money that the group can receive in reimbursement for the fetal tissue. The jarring dialogue, while it does not indicate illegal activity, has sparked a national outcry and forced Planned Parenthood to defend its funding on the national and state level. Planned Parenthood has repeatedly defended the practice of allowing women to donate fetal tissue for medical research, though it announced last year that it would no longer accept reimbursement for the procedure. Planned Parenthood officials say they are still assessing how much money they will seek in damages in the case. In the complaint, the group announced it is seeking compensatory, statutory and punitive damages. The timing for the decision is unclear, though the group’s chief legal counsel, Beth Parker, made clear it could take as long as 18 months. The legal back-and-forth could intensify the political debate on abortion through the upcoming elections. Planned Parenthood’s executive vice president Dawn Laguens alleged that the Center for Medical Progress has “colluded with right-wing state legislators and members of Congress” in their attack. “The complaint we filed today, names for the first time, the key individuals behind this fraud. They are some of the nation’s most extreme anti-abortion activists,” Laguens said. This story was updated at 2:26 p.m. View the discussion thread.

The footage was released a day after members of the media and several Democratic lawmakers were taken on a tour of the processing facility near the U.S.-Mexico border. Reporters were not allowed to bring cameras into the facility or interview anyone. The video shows dozens of children standing or sitting in cages made from metal fencing inside the old 55,000-square foot warehouse, which has been converted into a holding facility.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The announcement that Harry Reid will be retiring from the Senate in 2016, and likely succeeded by Chuck Schumer of New York as Democratic leader, would break a long streak in which floor leaders of the Senate — both majority and minority leaders — have predominantly hailed from smaller states. It's a little-recognized pattern that for several decades has expanded the influence of small states that are already greatly overrepresented in the Senate by virtue of the equal-representation principle that allocates two senators to each state. The pattern is undeniable: No Senate floor leader since Republican Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania left the minority leadership in 1977 has been from one of the nine largest states, which cumulatively make up more than half of the U.S. population. Indeed, nearly all Senate leaders have been from the bottom half of the states when ranked by population, including some of the very smallest in the Union. To wit: Over the past three decades, the Republican leaders in the Senate have been Howard Baker of Tennessee (17th-largest state today), Bob Dole of Kansas (34th), Trent Lott of Mississippi (31st), Bill Frist of Tennessee (17th) and currently Mitch McConnell of Kentucky (26th). If anything, Democratic leaders have hailed from even smaller states, at least since Lyndon Johnson of Texas left the Senate to become vice president in 1961. These have been Robert Byrd of West Virginia (38th), George Mitchell of Maine (41st), Mike Mansfield of Montana (44th), Tom Daschle of South Dakota (46th) and now Harry ReidHarry Mason ReidHarry Reid renews call for filibuster to be abolished: 'We need to get the Senate working again' White House says ball is in Congress's court on voting rights, abortion Biden grapples with twin crises MORE of Nevada (35th). The conventional wisdom for this pattern has been twofold, and reflects decisions that individual senators must make about whether it's possible to secure their own seats while also seeking advancement within the institution of the Senate itself. The first issue is that being a senator from a larger state can place dramatically greater demands from a vastly larger and more diverse number of voters and constituencies. Consider that a senator from California (with a population of 38.8 million) has nearly 14 times the number of constituents as one from Nevada (2.8 million). Or that a senator from Texas (26.9 million) has about 31 times as many constituents as a senator from South Dakota (850,000). Inevitably, successfully securing statewide reelection in a large state entails many more events to attend, hands to shake and groups to placate, as well as far more state-level issues and controversies and personalities to keep track of. The second, and related, issue is that the cost of running for reelection also grows exponentially in the larger states which, logically enough, also include the biggest and costliest media markets. And while it's true that there's a lot more money available to be collected in, say, Florida than Nebraska, that money nonetheless still must be raised, with all of the attendant time and energy that such fundraising requires. Thus, the upshot of this pattern has been that big-state senators have had to focus so much on their own states that it has been harder for them to rise through the ranks of the Senate as an institution into a leadership role. (The same logic does not necessarily apply to the House, where every district is roughly the same size.) Now the indefatigable Schumer now seems poised to break this pattern. New York is the fourth most-populous state, after California, Texas and Florida, and is a place of extraordinary complexities and challenges — even just within the confines of its largest city. But Schumer is a master strategist and a veteran fundraiser who has won reelection twice — by margins of 33 percentage points in 2010 and a staggering 47 points in 2004 — while managing to be the Democrats' No. 3 in the Senate since 2006. By positioning himself now as the likely next Democratic leader — which also shores up his already extremely favorable bid to retain his own seat in New York — Schumer can focus on winning back control of the Senate for his party. After all, Schumer may want to succeed Reid — but as the majority, not the minority, leader of the U.S. Senate. This piece has been corrected to properly identify the respective states represented by Howard Baker and Mike Mansfield in the Senate and to include Hugh Scott as a Senate minority leader from a large-population state.

It is not clear who would benefit from releasing the questions, either to pressure Trump to sit down or to poison the well for such an interview. The fact is that either could be true. The questions are largely predictable but probative. It could be used to show that there is no ambush to pressure Trump or that the questions are too broad to justify a refusal by Trump. The most devious would be a leak from the Trump team that could be used to cut off an interview on the basis of the leak itself. Then there are the questions themselves. While most coverage is focusing on the questions dealing with collusion and obstruction questions, those questions, with a couple exceptions, are fairly predictable. Those are not generally the biggest threats for a suspect or a target. The real danger oftens comes from the seemingly innocuous housekeeping questions. One such question is buried in the middle of the list: “When did you become aware of the Trump Tower meeting?” That question could force a dangerous contradiction for Trump if he is the “blocked caller” left unidentified in the recent House Intelligence Committee report. That remains a big “if,” given Trump’s past self-inflicted wounds from off-the-cuff statements and tweets. Worse yet, Trump does not appear to appreciate or at least recognize the criminal allegations raised against him. In yet another ill-advised tweet, Trump said, “It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened!” Perhaps, but Trump seems intent on showing that it can be done. It is possible for the president to be accused of obstructing justice into an investigation of a crime that did not occur. Obstruction addresses your conduct with regard to the investigation, not the underlying crime. Trump’s refusal to heed universal legal advice not to discuss the investigation publicly, or to raise it with figures like James ComeyJames Brien ComeyGiuliani told investigators it was OK to 'throw a fake' during campaign DOJ watchdog unable to determine if FBI fed Giuliani information ahead of 2016 election Biden sister has book deal, set to publish in April MORE, is the very basis for this allegation. In other words, Trump is building a case against himself tweet by tweet. While I continue to question the basis for a criminal charge on this evidence, Trump’s continued failure to recognize the danger of a self-inflicted wound is disconcerting for any lawyer. It also is true that one question would seem to suggest Mueller has a particularized interest in the conduct of Paul ManafortPaul John ManafortDOJ investigating one-time Trump campaign adviser over alleged ties to Qatar: report Foreign lobbyists donated over M during 2020 election: report Former Mueller prosecutor representing Donoghue in congressional probes: report MORE. The question asks, “What knowledge did Trump have of any outreach by his presidential campaign, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, to Russia about possible assistance to the campaign?” The question is framed as if an attempt by Manafort to get Russian assistance is an established fact. The question clearly contradicts Trump’s tweet that there are “no questions on collusion.” However, there still remains an absence of a crime raised in that question for Trump and he could likely navigate that line of questions with the assistance of counsel. Moreover, while some questions do deal with Trump business dealings before the election, they notably do not deal with Stormy Daniels and the serious allegations raised by payments made by Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Now to the sleeper question. The recent House Intelligence Committee report was largely well-supported and even included pointed, if somewhat indirect, criticism of Trump’s past statements. However, one element of the minority rebuttal also struck me as equally credible. The Democrats objected that a critical call was never pursued by the majority: Donald Trump Jr.Don TrumpHow Trump uses fundraising emails to remain undisputed leader of the GOP Donald Trump Jr. joins Cameo Book claims Trump family members were 'inappropriately' close with Secret Service agents MORE’s phone records show that he received a call from a blocked number between two calls with Emin Agalarov, an Azerbaijani singer and businessman who features greatly in the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Manafort, Jared KushnerJared Corey KushnerHouse panel tees up Trump executive privilege fight in Jan. 6 probe The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - US prepares vaccine booster plan House panel probing Jan. 6 attack seeks Trump records MORE and Russians. Democrats argue that Trump was known to use a blocked number to communicate with his son. The timing of the call strikes me as raising a legitimate question and, absent countervailing facts from the majority, would seem to constitute a glaring omission. It is not clear why the majority did not try to determine the identity of the “blocked caller” with a subpoena. The president and the White House, as well as Trump Jr., have denied that Trump was aware of the meeting. Mueller likely did not have the same hesitation as the House Intelligence Committee in subpoenaing the identity of the blocked caller. If Trump is the blocked caller, he would have to assume that Mueller already knows the answer to the sleeper question. He would have to admit to the call and either change his position or claim, implausibly, that he and Trump Jr. discussed unrelated subjects. This is why the greatest danger for Trump lurks not in the sexy questions but in the sleeper questions. This could be a motivation for the leaking of the questions by someone who is unconvinced that Trump could navigate all of these questions without tripping a wire. In the end, “Whodunit?” is less important than “What is to be done?” The president can sit down or bunker down. The problem, however, with a bunker approach is that Mueller does not need much of an opening to pursue Trump. All the special counsel needs is enough to slip a subpoena through.

The Commission on Unalienable Rights is meant to provide advice on human rights based on the nation’s founding principles and the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Pompeo said, arguing that there is confusion over what constitutes a human right. “As human rights claims have proliferated, some claims have come into tension with one another, provoking questions and clashes about which rights are entitled to gain respect,” Pompeo said while delivering remarks to reporters but without taking any questions. “Nation-states and international institutions remain confused about their respective responsibilities concerning human rights.” The commission drew swift scrutiny from critics who worry the panel will undermine protections for abortion rights and marginalized groups such as LGBT people. Critics were first concerned in May when a notice for the commission, published in the Federal Register, said the group would provide “fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights.” The term “natural law” has been used by opponents of same-sex marriage. “If this administration truly wanted to support people’s rights, it would use the global framework that’s already in place. Instead, it wants to undermine rights for individuals, as well as the responsibilities of governments,” Joanne Lin, national director of advocacy and government affairs at Amnesty International USA, said in a statement Monday. “This politicization of human rights in order to, what appears to be an attempt to further hateful policies aimed at women and LGBTQ people, is shameful.” The commission will be headed by Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard Law School professor and former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican during the George W. Bush administration. In brief remarks alongside Pompeo, Glendon said the commission will “do our very best to carry out your marching orders and to do so in a way that will assist you in your difficult task of transmuting principle into policy.” “I wanted to thank you especially for giving a priority to human rights at this moment when basic human rights are being misunderstood by many, manipulated by many and ignored by the world’s worst human rights violators,” Glendon told Pompeo. “You’ve asked us to work at the level of principle, not policy, and you’ve asked us to take our bearings from the distinctive rights tradition of the United States of America, a tradition that is grounded in the institutions without which rights would not be possible: constitutional government and the rule of law.” View the discussion thread.

You have to get them all moving in the right direction.” Asked what advice he would offer Ocasio-Cortez, Biden responded, “I would not presume to give her advice,” adding, “AOC is brilliant, the other three women are really smart.” Pelosi dismissed \"the squad,” as they are often referred to, after they were the only representatives to vote against a Trump-backed border aid bill, telling Maureen Dowd, “All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn’t have any following.” Ocasio-Cortez fired back, accusing Pelosi of singling out women of color, which in turn prompted a rebuke from members of the Congressional Black Caucus aligned with the Speaker. However, the divisions among the caucus have largely been dropped since Trump’s Sunday tweets telling the four congresswomen, all of whom are American citizens and three of whom were born in the U.S., to “go back” to other countries. Pelosi has announced she will introduce a resolution in the House condemning the remarks. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The House Republican tax bill released Thursday would allow churches to endorse political candidates, rolling back a 1950s-era law that bars such activities. The proposed change is listed at the end of the 429-page legislation. It states that churches should not lose their tax-exempt status based on statements about political candidates made during the course of religious services. The change to what is known as the Johnson Amendment has long been a priority of leaders on the religious right. They say the policy violates the First Amendment. The Johnson Amendment prohibits 501(c)(3) nonprofits from engaging in certain political activities. President Trump vowed to repeal the amendment during the campaign, saying it would \"give our churches their voice back.\" Shortly after taking office, Trump said he would “totally destroy” the amendment, which allows the IRS to revoke a church’s tax exempt status if it’s deemed to be participating in a political campaign. A group of more than 4,000 religious leaders from around the country wrote a letter in August opposing efforts to repeal the Johnson Amendment, saying it “would harm houses or worship, which are not identified or divided by partisan lines.” View the discussion thread.

Voting is a fundamental right in our country, and it is up to our elected officials to protect it,” the letter said. “The For the People Act would override many of the abusive state laws that make it harder for millions to cast their ballots, and set national standards for free and fair elections,” the letter added. Some of the companies that have signed the letter include Ben & Jerry’s, Lime, National Hockey League, Patagonia, and Youth To The People. In addition to promoting the For the People Act, the signatories of the letter also said similar bills, including the John LewisJohn LewisTexas abortion law roils businesses White House says ball is in Congress's court on voting rights, abortion H.R. 4 carries forward the legacy of Congressman John Lewis MORE Voting Rights Advancement Act, should also be passed. The For the People Act, otherwise known as H.R. 1 and S.1 in the House and Senate respectively, would require all states to provide mail-in ballots and automatic voter registration, would create new rules around redistricting, and would make Election Day a public holiday among other initiatives. The House has already passed its version, but it appears unlikely that the Senate will get 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. “We applaud the House for passing the For the People Act, and urge the Senate to follow suit and do its part to protect our democracy.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The Trump administration on Tuesday will reportedly rescind guidance to schools that bars discrimination against transgender students. The Washington Blade reported that President Trump has approved a plan for the Justice and Education departments to send a letter to schools rescinding guidance that transgender students be allowed to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity. The story quoted Mary Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, in reporting that the guidance would be changed on Tuesday. She cited \"reliable sources\" in saying that President Trump had \"green-lighted\" the plan. “This is the first day of the president’s second month in office and he is now fully coming after LGBT people,” she told the Blade. “I’m angry; I’m outraged. This is about kids who just want to go to school who just want to be themselves, and to hear the president a week or two ago talk about how supportive he is of LGBT people, it’s just outrageous that he go after trans kids this way.” A White House spokesperson did not confirm Keisling's allegations in the story. “We have nothing to add to this report right now, but will keep you posted if anything changes,” White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said. The Obama administration last year issued a guidance to all public school districts in the U.S. instructing them to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Ian Fleming famously lamented that history often moves so quickly that “heroes and villains keep on changing parts.” Our media and politicians are now struggling with the same problem today, following the killing of George Floyd. As rioting and looting continue across the country, the question is who to blame for the mayhem. Ultimately, the response was strikingly familiar and telling. Maybe white supremacists were behind it. Maybe the Russians were. It could be anyone except people in the rioting communities or, worse yet, groups lionized or tolerated by the left. While most protesters remained peaceful, the narrative quickly spiraled glaringly out of sync with images of burning buildings in the background. Although “Today” show host Craig Melvin tweeted out a guide not to refer to them as rioters but rather as protesters, that narrative has since broken down. Indeed, news outlets have been reporting that “outsiders” have been fueling the rioting and that the destruction might be the work of nefarious groups of white supremacists or Russians. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and other officials there claimed a majority of those arrested were outsiders. Walz estimated the figure at 80 percent. National Urban League President Marc Morial ratcheted up the outrage in a cable news interview. He demanded an investigation to confirm “if it is white supremacists, if it is Russians, if it is other foreign actors who have tried to exploit the pain and exploit legitimate protests.” It was manifestly implausible to suggest the rioting was the work of white supremacists or Russians. Arrest data showed a majority of those arrested in Minneapolis were from the city. The four people arrested in New York in fire bombing attacks were all state residents. The problem is that the most obvious culprits are all too familiar. A movement of anarchist, antifascist, and extreme left wing groups has been building for years, with violence from Washington to Berkeley. The most prominent is antifa, but there are also groups like By All Means Necessary with similar histories. This is a broad movement, not one group, which makes the suggested designation by President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE of antifa as a terrorist organization both constitutionally and practically dubious. However, the growing antifascist movement has attacked conservative speakers and events for years, with far less media attention than their right wing counterparts receive. Just as many critics have accused Trump of not doing enough to denounce extreme right wing groups, many Democratic leaders have been conspicuously silent in denouncing these antifascist groups. Indeed, when Attorney General William BarrBill BarrHouse panel, Commerce Department reach agreement on census documents House panel tees up Trump executive privilege fight in Jan. 6 probe Arizona elections officials launch bipartisan assault on GOP audit MORE correctly observed that the rioting shows “antifa like tactics,” politicians and media figures both balked at the suggestion, as opposed to accepting the white supremacist or Russian option. Despite reports of antifa followers and anarchists being arrested, White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor objected that there was “no evidence” of any activity sparked by anarchists. Antifa, By All Means Necessary, and other militant or anarchist groups have disrupted universities across the country, including my own, for years. They have found many political and academic allies. Dartmouth Professor Mark Bray wrote a book on antifa, defining the movement as committed to the silencing of opponents and the rejection of classic concepts of free speech. The movement has since found open or passive acceptance with many on the academic left. In fairness, however, many Democratic politicians have denounced past violent attacks. Yet despite its violent history, some Democratic leaders have been enablers or outright supporters of the antifa movement, insisting that such groups cannot be compared to extreme right wing groups. While criticizing antifa members three years ago, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted the group has “been there forever” and that “some people may have infiltrated” it. This was not viewed as her Charlottesville moment of claiming there are “very fine people” in antifa. It was a commonly held view that antifascists are by definition better than fascists. Other Democratic leaders have been much more direct in their support, including the former deputy chair of the Democratic Party, Representative Keith Ellison. Although Germany has banned an antifa website, Ellison posed with the antifa handbook to show support at a Minneapolis bookshop and said it would “strike fear in the heart” of Trump. Ellison, now the Minnesota state attorney general, was under fire this week for telling protesters they should not attack the National Guard on the streets or “react to them the way you might react to the Minneapolis Police Department. Their job is to try to bring peace and calm back again.” His son Jeremiah Ellison, a Minneapolis city council member, declared support for antifa even as the city endured rioting and looting. Meanwhile, some media coverage has the uncomfortable feel of a new type of Russia collusion theory. Susan Rice, former national security adviser to President Obama, said that she suspects Russia is behind the effort “to hijack those protests and turn them into something very different” and that “this is right out of the Russian playbook.” It is likely that racist or foreign actors will try to exploit the unrest on the internet. The same was true, on a larger scale, with Russian interference in the 2016 election. While most of us denounced that Russian interference, it was never plausible that the work of a dozen internet trolls in Saint Petersburg or a dozen military hackers in Moscow had a measurable, let alone meaningful, impact on the outcome of the election. The same is true with these protests. The rioting began due to deep seated and legitimate anger over police brutality and the tragic death of Floyd. Young people and others did not rush to the streets because they read a posting from some skinhead on the Stormfront website. Yet the references to white supremacists or Russians continued even as reports filtered in of antifa and anarchists being arrested in various cities. Some politicians in the past sought to tap into the antifascist movement. Others completely avoided denouncing the group. After all, for years, the movement threatened or attacked conservatives. They were not treated as an outside element but rather as this grassroots movement outraged by Trump and his policies. However, the same tactics and likely some of the same people are now burning buildings and cars, attacking police officers and business owners, and destroying property across the country. This is why, during the French Revolution, the journalist Jacques Mallet Pan warned, “Like Saturn, the revolution devours its children.” Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.

Other declared Democrats include former Obama official Lindsey Davis Stover and Kimberly Adams, former president of a local teachers union. And Dorothy McAuliffe, the wife of outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), is considering a bid. LuAnn Bennett, the 2016 Democratic nominee who lost to Comstock, told the Loudoun Tribune she doesn’t plan to run. But perhaps the biggest name to enter the race is state Sen. Jennifer Wexton, who was courted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). She’s a former county prosecutor who has experience winning competitive races. Wexton’s entry prompted election handicapper Cook Political Report to move the race from lean Republican to a toss-up. California’s 45th District Rep. Mimi Walters Walters hasn’t always been a Democratic target, but she has weathered attacks for voting to advance the House GOP’s unpopular bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare out of committee. Now she’s been singled out as a top California target in a district Clinton won by more than 5 points. Consumer advocate and former Wall Street watchdog Katie Porter entered the race with high-profile endorsements from Sens. Elizabeth WarrenElizabeth WarrenScott Brown's wife files to run for Congress Schiff calls on Amazon, Facebook to address spread of vaccine misinformation Yellen triggers alarm bells over debt ceiling cliff MORE (D-Mass.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). She was a former law student of Warren’s, and the two have worked together. Porter isn’t the only professor from the University of California, Irvine looking to unseat Walters. Dave Min is a law professor who served as a former economic policy adviser to Senate Minority Leader Charles SchumerChuck SchumerRetail group backs minimum corporate tax, increased IRS enforcement House Democrats outline plan for transition to clean electricity Capitol Police warning of potential for violence during rally backing rioters: report MORE (D-N.Y.) and at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.

Sherrod BrownSherrod Campbell BrownDOJ giving more than 0,000 to help survivors of Dayton shooting Progressive Democratic lawmakers urge Biden to replace Powell as Fed chair Eviction ruling puts new pressure on Congress MORE (D-Ohio), said he raised $100,000 in two weeks. Hamadanchy, who is Iranian-American, said Trump’s travel ban on citizens of Iran and other Muslim-majority countries motivated him to run. California’s 48th District Rep. Dana Rohrabacher Rohrabacher has served in Congress for nearly three decades, but his well-known pro-Russia stance is now in the spotlight as Congress and the FBI investigate Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. Rohrabacher has already drawn a few Democratic challengers. Democratic margins are closer here than in other targeted districts — Clinton won the district by less than 2 points. A Democratic attempt to unseat Rohrabacher could be hindered by the Republican pasts of some challengers. Business owner Laura Oatman was a Republican until 2008 and registered independent to vote for former President Barack ObamaBarack Hussein ObamaScott Brown's wife files to run for Congress Why a slower start can benefit a new president Biden to stump for Newsom on Monday during western swing MORE, according to the Orange County Register. She changed her party affiliation to become a Democrat after Trump’s win. Businessman Henry Rouda is also a former Republican. He said he’s voted for Democratic presidential nominees since 2004 but donated to Republicans until 2007, according to the Register. The race has also drawn two other Democratic candidates, real estate broker Boyd Roberts and airline pilot Tony Zarkades. California’s 50th District Rep. Duncan Hunter Hunter represents a safe red seat that Trump won by 15 points. But the embattled congressman is being investigated by the Justice Department over an alleged campaign finance violation. And he raised eyebrows after using campaign funds to fly a pet rabbit. That has prompted a long line of Democrats looking to run in the San Diego-area seat. The DCCC recruited retired Navy SEAL Josh Butner, who currently serves as a local school board member. In his announcement, Butner brought up the allegations that Hunter used campaign dollars on personal expenses. Ammar Campa-Najjar, a former Department of Labor public information officer, said he was urged to run by people he met while working on Obama’s 2012 campaign, according to the San Diego Union Tribune. Other Democratic contenders include Grossmont Healthcare District Trustee Gloria Chadwick, Pierre “Pete” Beauregard, a veteran and organic beef rancher, and businessman Patrick Malloy, who lost to Hunter in 2016 by nearly 28 points. Pennsylvania’s 7th District Rep. Patrick Meehan Meehan passed on a 2018 Senate bid against Sen. Bob CaseyRobert (Bob) Patrick CaseyAbortion rights groups want Biden to use bully pulpit after Texas law Overnight Health Care: Democrats plot response to Texas abortion law House to vote on bill guaranteeing abortion access in response to Texas law MORE Jr. (D-Pa.). But if he wants to maintain his powerful role on the House Ways and Means Committee, he’ll need to defend a district that Clinton won by more than 2 points. Three Democrats have announced challenges to Meehan, though they all live outside his suburban Philadelphia district. Dan Muroff is an attorney and ward leader in Philadelphia, where he currently lives. He was the former president of a gun violence prevention group and worked as an aide to Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and former Rep. Joe Hoeffel (D-Pa.). Muroff unsuccessfully ran in the 2016 Democratic primary for then-Rep. Chaka Fattah’s seat. He said earlier this month he’ll move to the district in a few weeks, according to PoliticsPA. Molly Sheehan is a biomedical researcher and plans to move back to the district by the end of the year, when she completes her fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania. Andrew McGinty, an IT consultant who lives in Philadelphia, is also running. Illinois’ 6th District Rep. Peter Roskam Democrats are also targeting Roskam’s suburban seat outside of Chicago. Roskam has represented the district since 2007 and easily outperformed Trump, who lost the district by 7 points. Amanda Howland, a lawyer and psychologist, is looking for a comeback after losing to Roskam by nearly 20 points last year. Former district school board member Suzyn Price also announced a bid. Local planning commission member Kelly Mazeski, a former state Senate candidate, is looking at a run and met with the DCCC and EMILY’s List about a potential campaign. Other Democrats considering running include Maura Sullivan, a U.S. Marine veteran who’s reportedly a DCCC favorite, according to Crain’s Chicago Business. Carole Cheney, a district chief of staff to Rep. Bill FosterGeorge (Bill) William FosterOvernight Defense: Senators reach billion deal on emergency Capitol security bill | House panel looks to help military sexual assault survivors | US increases airstrikes to help Afghan forces fight Taliban We must address the declining rate of startup business launches Republicans seek vindication amid reemergence of Wuhan lab theory MORE (D-Ill.), is “likely” running. California’s 25th District Rep. Steve Knight Knight has also been on Democrats’ target list since he was elected to Congress in 2014. In 2015, Knight caught flak for his confrontation with a protester at an immigration rally, and his campaign initially had lackluster fundraising ahead of his competitive race. But he was reelected to a second term and outperformed Trump, with Clinton winning the district by nearly 7 points. Katie Hill, executive director of a group that provides homeless services and housing, declared a run for the northern Los Angeles County seat. At a recent town hall, Hill asked how Knight would have voted on the GOP’s ObamaCare replacement bill if it had reached the House floor. Knight said he wouldn’t discuss a “hypothetical,” earning loud boos from the crowd. Jess Phoenix, a volcanologist, is “90-plus percent sure” she’ll run, according to the Los Angeles Times. She’s receiving help from 314 Action, a group that recruits people with science backgrounds to run for office. Lawyer Bryan Caforio, who lost to Knight in 2016, is considering another run.

All Rights Reserved House Democrats on Tuesday will launch their long-sought investigation into the Capitol attack of Jan. 6, kicking off a contentious probe just as GOP infighting over the insurrection — and former President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE’s role in it — is reaching a fever pitch. The first hearing of the select committee will feature testimony from police officers who defended the Capitol complex from the violent mob that day.

Heading into Tuesday’s hearing, the internal GOP sparring has now evolved into a bare-knuckle brawl. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthyKevin McCarthyGOP leader taking proxy voting fight to Supreme Court Capitol Police warning of potential for violence during rally backing rioters: report Capitol Police to brief congressional leaders on rally backing Jan. 6 rioters MORE (R-Calif.) ripped the two defectors on Monday, characterizing them as “Pelosi Republicans” — a disparaging reference, in the eyes of conservatives, given the GOP’s historic disdain for the long-serving Democratic leader. Both Cheney and Kinzinger, who huddled with Democratic members of the Jan. 6 panel on Monday, shot back at McCarthy, calling his remarks “childish,” if not unexpected. “We’re doing big things right now. We’re getting to the answers of the worst attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812. He can call me any names he wants,” Kinzinger, a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, told reporters as he emerged from the strategy session. “I’m a Republican. Kevin McCarthy is technically my Republican leader. And to call … members of Congress by childish names like Donald Trump used to do, I guess it’s just kind of par for the course,” Kinzinger added. The internal clash is highlighting the explosive controversy surrounding Trump’s actions following his election defeat in November, when he spread false claims that the results were fraudulent and encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol to block the certification of President BidenJoe BidenKentucky state lawmakers vote to scrap school mask mandate Arkansas governor pushes back against Biden's vaccine mandate RNC vows to sue over Biden vaccine, testing mandate MORE’s victory. Five people died in events related to the Jan. 6 insurrection, and about 140 police officers were injured. Four of those officers — two representing the U.S. Capitol Police corps and two from the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department — are scheduled to testify Tuesday on their experiences defending Congress that day. All four have been critical of both Trump’s actions and those of the Republicans now downplaying the violence of Jan. 6. McCarthy had initially nominated five Republicans to the select committee. But Pelosi rejected two of them — Reps. Jim Banks (Ind.) and Jim JordanJames (Jim) Daniel JordanRepublican leaders misjudged Jan. 6 committee Watchdog group seeks ethics probe over McCarthy's Jan. 6 comments Congress should fire back on McCarthy's obstruction tactics MORE (Ohio), staunch Trump supporters whom the Speaker deemed to be a threat to the “integrity” of the investigation. In response, McCarthy yanked all of his GOP picks from the panel, calling it a Pelosi-orchestrated “sham” designed only to attack Trump and Republicans ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. The boycott was hailed by many in the GOP conference, but it was also a gamble, leaving Trump without any defenders on the dais as the select committee plows ahead with its work. Democrats are hardly sympathetic to the GOP’s plight, noting that Republican leaders had initially endorsed — but ultimately blocked — the formation of an independent, 9/11-style commission to investigate the attack. “Kevin McCarthy has made his bed and he has to sleep in it,” Rep. Jamie RaskinJamin (Jamie) Ben RaskinGOP seeks to keep spotlight on Afghanistan as Dems advance Biden's .5T spending plan Raskin writing memoir about Jan. 6, son's suicide House Democrats demand details after Border Patrol agents accused of profiling Latinos in Michigan MORE (D-Md.), one of Pelosi’s picks on the committee, told The Hill on Monday. The arrival of the investigation — and intraparty warfare that’s accompanied it — has put McCarthy in a difficult spot at a moment he is trying to unify his 211-member conference against the Biden administration in a bid to take back the majority next year. McCarthy is facing calls from the Freedom Caucus, the bloc of conservative rabble-rousers close to Trump, to force a symbolic floor vote by the end of the week to oust Pelosi from the Speakership. Other rank-and-file Republicans are pushing McCarthy to seek retribution against Cheney and Kinzinger for agreeing to serve on Pelosi’s Jan. 6 panel. On Monday, Rep. Matt GaetzMatthew (Matt) GaetzPolice brace for Capitol rally defending Jan. 6 mob Watchdog group seeks ethics probe over McCarthy's Jan. 6 comments Cawthorn to introduce resolution condemning political violence after warning of 'bloodshed' if elections are 'rigged' MORE (R-Fla.) called on McCarthy to strip them of their other House committee assignments. “They're no longer a member of our team,” Gaetz, a key Trump ally, said on Newsmax TV. Appearing at a White House event Monday, McCarthy took aim at Cheney and Kinzinger but was noncommittal when asked if he wanted to see them booted from their other congressional committees, as he did in 2019 with then-Rep. Steve KingSteven (Steve) Arnold KingGOP brawls over Trump on eve of first Jan. 6 hearing Pence to visit Iowa to headline event for congressman Former Steve King challenger on rural voters in GOP states: 'They hate Democrats' MORE (R-Iowa) over his defense of white supremacy. \"We’ll see,” McCarthy told reporters in the Rose Garden. Some McCarthy allies said they don’t see him backing the effort to punish Cheney and Kinzinger. It would further highlight GOP divisions, and it’s unlikely McCarthy could even successfully oust the pair given that Pelosi and the Democrats, who hold the majority, would have the option to vote down the GOP effort on the floor, Democratic sources said. “I think it’s a stretch at this point” that McCarthy would take action, said one GOP lawmaker close to the leader. The internal jousting has highlighted Trump’s continued grip on the party — and the disagreeable choice facing Republican lawmakers as a result. Either they endorse his lie about the “stolen” election and downplay the violence of Jan. 6, or they risk his ire — and perhaps a career-ending primary challenge. Indeed, nine of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in January are already facing promises of such a challenge, and the former president is offering to endorse any GOP candidate who might emerge to take on the 10th, Rep. John KatkoJohn Michael KatkoBipartisan House group introduces legislation to set term limit for key cyber leader Hillicon Valley — Industry groups want more time to report cybersecurity incidents Hillicon Valley — Industry groups want more time to report cybersecurity incidents MORE (R-N.Y.). Cheney, a defense hawk and scion of a conservative political dynasty despised by Democrats for decades, has suddenly found herself being hailed by liberals as a patriot. “The country increasingly is going to be appreciating the integrity and constitutional patriotism of Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and other Republicans who are willing to investigate for the truth, rather than for a narrow partisan agenda,” Raskin said. In February, Raskin led the Democrats’ prosecution during Trump’s second impeachment trial, which included graphic video of a pro-Trump mob attacking police officers as they defended the Capitol. A mix of new and old video of Jan. 6 will play a role in Tuesday’s hearing as well, Democrats said. Cheney, who was ousted from GOP leadership in May for continuing to blame Trump for Jan. 6, will get a prime speaking slot during the hearing immediately after Chairman Bennie ThompsonBennie Gordon ThompsonRepublican leaders misjudged Jan. 6 committee Bipartisan House group introduces legislation to set term limit for key cyber leader Spotlight turns to GOP's McCarthy in Jan. 6 probe MORE (D-Miss.) gives his opening remarks. With so much media attention on the Jan. 6 panel’s opening hearing, Trump’s loyalists made clear they’ll try to distract and run counterprogramming. McCarthy and his five picks for the panel will hold a news conference Tuesday morning, before the hearing, likely trying to shift blame on Pelosi for the security breakdown at the Capitol that day.

And later, Greene, Gaetz and others will head to the Justice Department to demand information about the “treatment” of Jan. 6 insurrectionists who remain in jail. Trump’s critics in both parties are ignoring the distractions, saying the Jan. 6 attack was a threat to the nation’s underlying democratic traditions — and one that deserves a thorough examination. \"It's going to be ... a really important opportunity to remind everybody about the necessity of accountability for what happened, [and] for making sure that it never happens again,\" Cheney said.

Trump sued in Wisconsin more than a month after Biden won the state by just over 20,000 votes. His lawsuit claimed that policies put in place by the Wisconsin Election Commission to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus — like establishing absentee ballot drop boxes — illegally usurped the state legislature’s sole power over election rules. When he filed the suit in late December, Trump had asked the court to fast-track a review of his case ahead of the Jan. 6 meeting of Congress to certify the results, a request the justices denied. That joint congressional session was later interrupted when a violent pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol. Trump's comments to the mob just prior to the riot fueled his second impeachment in the House. He was later acquitted in the Senate. The court’s denial of Trump’s appeal on Monday means that fewer than four justices agreed to hear his case. Several of the court’s more conservative justices had previously indicated an interest in addressing questions over what the Constitution says about how election authority is allocated within states. As is typical practice, however, the justices did not provide the public on Monday with a full view of how they voted on the petition or their reasoning. Some legal scholars believe that the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol dissuaded the court from taking up disputes related to the 2020 election over concerns that it could fuel false claims promoted by Trump and his allies that the election results were illegitimate.

Flake added: “No, this is not the plot of a movie set in an asylum” but rather “your contemporary Republican Party, where today there is no greater offense than honesty.” House Republicans are expected to meet behind closed doors on Wednesday morning and vote to remove Cheney from her role as the GOP conference chair, the third-ranking position in their leadership. “Every one of us who has sworn the oath must act to prevent the unraveling of our democracy. This is not about policy. This is not about partisanship. This is about our duty as Americans,\" Cheney told her colleagues in a floor speech late Tuesday. Flake, who represented Arizona in the upper chamber from 2013 to 2019, criticized some Republicans in the op-ed for “a celebration of the unwise and the untrue,” citing conspiracy theories that former President Obama was not born in the U.S. and more. “I had hoped that, over time, my Republican constituents would feel differently about the former president, or at least value a Republican who pushed back, and that I could stand for reelection in 2018 with a reasonable chance of surviving a Republican primary,” Flake wrote. “It soon became apparent that Republican voters wanted someone who was all in with a president that I increasingly saw as a danger to the republic.

The libertarian brothers, who have built a network of organizations to support and develop public policy in line with their political views, have been criticized by liberals as emblematic of the post-Citizens United era of campaign finance. Their network reportedly plans to spend $889 million on the 2016 elections. Their fortune comes from Koch Industries, the Kansas-based company that they lead. They, like Paul, have been vocal about their support for criminal justice reform — based largely on a libertarian belief that the justice system has become an example of government abuse that disproportionately affects poor people and minorities.

Former President Obama, who a recent CNN poll showed is viewed as a better president than Trump by a margin of 56 to 37 percent, should now step forward, clearly, thoughtfully and forcefully. He should speak with the fierce urgency of now on behalf of Democrats facing the most important midterm elections in modern history. The problem facing Democrats is not lack of a message, it is lack of a messenger. Democrats in Congress and across America are offering worthy and compelling policies, but the most vivid pictures voters see of Democrats on television are sound bite snippets of talk that is dominated by Trump. Obama is the only national Democrat who would galvanize an explosion of attention from the media and voters about what Democrats stand for, who Democrats fight for and how Democrats will make life better in a nation that hungers for not just attacks against Trump, but a compelling alternative to Trump. Obama and every Democrat should watch “Bobby Kennedy for President,” the stirring new documentary from Netflix that I mentioned last week, because the story of RFK demonstrates by living history the heart, soul and fighting spirit that Democrats should offer to lead the nation in 2018 and 2020. Many Americans feel left behind, alienated and worried because they do not share in the prosperity of the nation and do not feel that anyone in Washington cares about them. Many would vote for a politician who speaks thousands of falsehoods and is embroiled in dozens of scandals if they believe he is the only politician speaking to them, no matter how untrue his words. Democrats in 2018 should remember Bobby Kennedy in 1968. RFK fought with passion and conviction for underprivileged blacks, exploited Hispanic workers, hard-hit white voters in Appalachia and young people whose dreams he offered the promise of coming true. If Obama comes out swinging in 2018 as RFK came out swinging in 1968 he would light up the television screens and social media platforms with saturation coverage of the political battle of our century between two competing parties and visions, pitting the good things Obama did as president, which make him still so popular today, against the vile things Trump does to destroy them, which makes him so widely disliked by comparison. Obama should fight like a lion for ObamaCare and against massive insurance premiums caused by the disastrous policies of Trump and Republicans, which would have been even more catastrophic except for the courageous single vote of a timeless American hero, Sen. John McCainJohn Sidney McCainWhat the chaos in Afghanistan can remind us about the importance of protecting democracy at home 'The View' plans series of conservative women as temporary McCain replacements In Afghanistan, we've opened the gates of hell MORE (R-Ariz.), whom Obama and so many Americans honor with high praise. Obama should fight like a lion for the Dreamers against the cruel, vicious and sometimes race-baiting attacks by Trump who broke his word to Democratic leaders and seeks to kill the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Obama should proclaim, as John KennedyJohn Neely KennedyMORE said, that a rising tide should lift all boats, while Republicans offer tax cuts that enhance big fortunes of the wealthiest and provide small change to everyone else. He should remind voters, as Robert Kennedy said the night Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, that America does not need more hatred and division but more love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another as fellow members of the American family.

All Rights Reserved On Nov. 6, American women will rise up at the polls, in such large numbers and with such determined resolve, that Democrats will regain control of the House and make a strong run to win control of the Senate. 2018 will be the year when American women say no to President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE and the brand of politics he represents. They are fearful of his anger and rage, appalled by his politics of destruction and alarmed by his attacks against their rights, including his intensely repeated vow to achieve the reversal of Roe v. Wade. 2018 will be the year when American women say no to the perpetual politics of division and humiliation that Trump has brought to our daily national life. 2018 will be the year that American women say no to a politics based on fear and anger by a president who views America not as a great and diverse national family, but as a battleground of warring tribes fighting bitter feuds against our neighbors. 2018 will be the year that American women say no to a president who has insulted a long list of women he disapproves of, most recently the chancellor of Germany and the prime minister of Great Britain, while his fixer arranged payoffs to keep secret the dark side of his private affairs. 2018 will be the year that American women say no to an immigration policy so hostile to family values that boys and girls were placed in cages and ripped apart from their mothers and fathers. 2018 will be the year that American women revolt against GOP health-care policies that attack Planned Parenthood, which has always received strong bipartisan support, while Trump seeks to overturn Roe v. Wade and strip insurance coverage from patients with preexisting conditions. Of course when I refer to “American women” I mean the majority of American women who disapprove of Trump and are so fearful, offended and appalled that they are hypermotivated to vote in much larger than expected numbers. Midterm elections are decided by voter turnout. While polls show Democrats with a solid advantage in generic midterm polling, they also show Democrats with a solid advantage in voter enthusiasm. While there is a surge of enthusiasm among the vast Democratic and liberal base, a surge of anti-Trump sentiment among a growing number of moderate and suburban Republican voters, and increased voter registration appealing to black and Hispanic voters, the two groups whose turnout will skyrocket above historical levels in the coming midterms are women and young voters. When I marched with the Women’s March in Washington, and later with the students who marched on Washington, I was struck by how both marches brought surges of voter registration. The women and student marchers have grown into a national movement and cause of registering and turning out voters. Opposition to Trump has fueled a powerful surge of high-quality female Democratic candidates for office at all levels, in all states. Fear of Trump mobilizes women to action, making donations large and small to good candidates and causes. Anger about Trump and the desire to bring change against Trump inspires a generation of female voters, young voters, black voters, Hispanic voters and others to register a wave of new voters who will turn out in droves in November. 2016 was the year when Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonHoward Stern rips vaccine opponents: 'F--- their freedom, I want my freedom to live' New Hampshire Democrat wins GOP-held state House seat Clinton thrilled to have Joan Allen recording her new book MORE defeated Donald Trump for president by almost 3 million popular votes, leaving Trump with an obsession so abnormal he compulsively attacks her almost two years after the election! 2017 was the year when women rose up with a fury, supported by the men who love them, against those who abuse them. 2018 will be the year when women say no to Donald Trump. They will demand our country be governed like the great American family we are. They will make their stand and stake their claim to take back America from Trump. These women will vote. These women will win. Budowsky was an aide to former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and former Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.), who was chief deputy majority whip of the House of Representatives.

Kelly has been tainted by Trump lying in the face of facts. Hasn't he seen the same video of Rep. Wilson that everyone else has seen?” Waters tweeted Saturday. “If the wife and family of Sgt. Johnson feel they were disrespected by Trump, then they were disrespected. Period!” Waters continued. “Gen. Kelly, you earned 4 stars & had a successful career. Now you've fallen prey to a 'moron' in an effort to protect his career. Apologize.” Gen. Kelly has been tainted by Trump lying in the face of facts. Hasn't he seen the same video of Rep. Wilson that everyone else has seen? If the wife and family of Sgt. Johnson feel they were disrespected by Trump, then they were disrespected. Period! Gen. Kelly, you earned 4 stars & had a successful career. Now you've fallen prey to a \"moron\" in an effort to protect his career. Apologize. Earlier Saturday, Waters ripped members of the Trump administration, saying Trump’s White House “transforms everyone into liars.” Trump’s White House has continued to feud with Wilson after the congresswoman criticized Trump earlier this week for his call to the widow of a fallen U.S. service member. Wilson was in a car with the fallen soldier’s family when Trump called, and the family confirmed her description of the call, which took place on speakerphone. Wilson said the president told the widow her late husband \"knew what he signed up for ... but when it happens it hurts anyway.\" The mother of the slain soldier, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, told The Washington Post that the president disrespected the family with his call. Kelly defended Trump's handling of the call to the family and others during a rare appearance at the White House press briefing on Thursday. Kelly also ripped into Wilson, calling her an \"empty barrel\" and criticizing her for her conduct at a 2015 event. But video released Friday appears to show that Kelly was incorrect in his accusation that she took credit for the funding of an FBI building in Miami in 2015. Wilson slammed the White House, saying it was trying to “assassinate [her] character.” “They are assassinating their own because everything they say is coming out and shown to be a lie,” she told The New York Times. The White House defended Kelly on Friday, with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling it “highly inappropriate” to debate Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general. \"If you want to go after Gen. Kelly, that's up to you, but I think if you want to get into a debate with a four-star Marine general, I think that's something highly inappropriate,” Sanders said in a White House press briefing.

All Rights Reserved New York Times opinion columnist Paul Krugman said Monday that Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States represent a new axis of evil. \"There's a new axis of evil: Russia, Saudi Arabia — and the United States,\" Krugman tweeted, linking to a story about how the three countries all declined to endorse the United Nation's latest climate study. There's a new axis of evil: Russia, Saudi Arabia -- and the United States  The phrase \"axis of evil\" was coined by former President George W. Bush to refer to Iraq, Iran and North Korea in 2002, three countries accused of supporting terrorism or of nuclear proliferation. The United States, along with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, at a climate summit in Poland objected to language welcoming a report produced by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The U.N. report predicted that nations had only until 2030 to prevent the global temperatures from rising to the point where there would be great risk for drought, wildfires and other disasters that could lead to global food shortages. It said that unless nations take \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society,\" there would be disastrous levels of global warming. The State Department, according to a report by CNN, said it voted against welcoming the report because it did not want to be seen as endorsing it. \"The United States was willing to note the report and express appreciation to the scientists who developed it, but not to welcome it, as that would denote endorsement of the report,\" it said in a statement. \"As we have made clear in the IPCC and other bodies, the United States has not endorsed the findings of the report.\" The State Department said its decision was discussed with the other nations that voted against welcoming the report.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved At a time when too many hard-working American families are still recovering from the devastating impact of the 2008 financial crash, deregulating Wall Street’s biggest firms again makes no sense. Yet the Financial CHOICE Act threatens to do exactly that. It would allow the biggest Wall Street banks to opt-out of significant financial protection rules, while those banks that remain in the regulatory system would be blessed with watered down versions of once-tough protections, like living wills and stress tests. Perhaps most worryingly, the CHOICE Act would cripple two of the most important post-crash reforms: the Financial Stability and Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In exchange for maintaining a 10-percent leverage ratio, only modestly higher than what many banks today maintain, the CHOICE Act would allow Wall Street banks to opt-out of some of the most important post-crash financial protection rules. This is far too cheap a toll to allow banks onto this deregulatory off-ramp. Remember that the capital shortfall of the biggest banks in 2008-2009 was about 20 percent, and that was after the government and taxpayers de facto nationalized the financial system with massive bailouts. Thus, even if banks were required to maintain 10-percent capital, they would still be 100-percent short of what they would need to survive a crash similar to 2008. The CHOICE Act would also slash in half the number of stress tests for most banks and require regulators to publicly disclose exactly how the tests would be evaluated, effectively giving the banks a road map to passing the test. Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve to conduct annual “stress tests” to gauge the health of large U.S. banks. The Fed's stress tests are one of the most effective tools regulators have to prevent a future financial crisis. Even Gary Cohn, chair of the National Economic Council, acknowledged this when he was the president of Goldman Sachs: “We’re subject to enormously robust stress tests here in the United States, and I give the Fed enormous credit for what they’ve done in stress testing the major banks here in the United States.” Resolution plans, called “living wills,” are an essential early defense to protect us from the catastrophic failure of a large banks, but after years of effort, regulators still find that too many banks continue to pose too great a threat to our financial stability. The CHOICE Act significantly weakens the “living will” process, cutting the number of submissions in half and requiring regulators to tell the banks how the wills will be graded so they can game the system and ensure they pass. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created to be an early warning system to help detect and prevent future financial, economic and human calamities like those of 2008-2009. Congress created the FSOC with widespread bipartisan support, as well as support from the banking industry, in response to the catastrophic failure of unregulated nonbank systemic threats like American Insurance Group (AIG). AIG’s failure happened because no one regulator was responsible for overseeing the systemic risk posed by the firm. To stop future crises, we need a strong and effective FSOC. But the CHOICE Act would cripple the FSOC’s operations and make its effective oversight of nonbanks impossible. It would retroactively repeal the FSOC’s designations of certain nonbank financial firms as systemically important and prohibit the FSOC from making any such designations in the future. It would strip the FSOC of its ability to prohibit or otherwise limit Wall Street gigantic firms from engaging in certain risky activities, and tie up the council’s budget and operations with congressional interference. The CHOICE Act’s micromanagement of the FSOC even dictates how the council should hold its internal votes. The FSOC needs flexibility, discretion and independence to identify new and emerging risks and keep current with market developments and financial innovations. The CHOICE Act would add unnecessary layers of bureaucracy for the FSOC and undermine its mission, putting taxpayers at risk again of having to bailout Wall Street. The CFPB has proven to be the most effective consumer protection agency ever created. It has returned almost $12 billion to more than 29 million Americans who have been ripped off by financial firms. No one knows where the next crash will be incubated, but it will almost certainly have a predatory and fraudulent basis where financial consumers are systematically ripped off, which will spread risk through the financial system. The best way to stop this is with a strong CFPB, possessing broad authority to stop predatory and fraudulent conduct. Eliminating it, or crippling it by making it a commission (a euphemism for partisan paralysis) or subjecting it to the annual congressional appropriations process (where it can be underfunded by Wall Street’s allies to render it ineffective) would take the consumer cops off the Wall Street beat. The most recent job numbers were notable for several reasons, not the least of which is that unemployment is at a 10-year low. Or, put another way, employment levels have returned to where they were before the 2008 crisis. Similarly, bank lending and profits have rebounded as well. As the country continues to recover from the 2008 crash, one has to wonder why we would risk the progress we have made by taking a major step backward and undoing the financial protection rules that have enabled us to get this far.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved After President Trump’s tweet today attacking the current leadership of the FBI and the release of the infamous “Nunes memo” that is another aggressive attack against the FBI from Trump allies in Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray should make it clear to the president that he will resign if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod RosensteinRod RosensteinWashington still needs more transparency House Judiciary to probe DOJ's seizure of data from lawmakers, journalists The Hill's Morning Report - Biden-Putin meeting to dominate the week MORE or special counsel Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerSenate Democrats urge Garland not to fight court order to release Trump obstruction memo Why a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel MORE. Some have suggested, with legitimate reason, that Wray should resign in protest because the Nunes memo was released today. I understand and respect their point, but I respectfully disagree with this suggestion. There is a better way. FBI Director Wray should ask for a personal meeting with President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE with no other individuals present, including White House chief of staff John KellyJohn Francis KellyMORE, in the hope of avoiding a constitutional crisis that would morally and patriotically require him to resign in protest. In the scenario proposed here, Wray would tell Trump that he wants to make it unequivocally clear that he will resign in protest if and when Trump fires Mueller or Rosenstein and that his decision is not subject to discussion. Wray could then consider whether he should issue a one sentence public statement about his position or have his message to Trump conveyed on background to major media. If Wray takes the “nuclear option” action I suggest here, it would be the equivalent of the Cold War nuclear strategy of mutually assured destruction, which deterred and prevented nuclear war because it guaranteed the virtual end of the world had nuclear war occurred. I have warned in recent weeks that the Nunes memo was designed to become a pretext for Trump to first fire Rosenstein and then Mueller. If Wray makes it unequivocally clear to Trump that he will resign in protest if Trump attempts a version of Nixon’s Saturday Night Massacre, that would hopefully deter Trump from taking actions that force a constitutional crisis, bitterly divide our country and destroy his presidency. The Nunes memo was fundamentally a desperate fraud, committed for partisan purposes, radically deceptive and dishonest in its attacks against the FBI and its misrepresentation of the FISA warrant process. As I wrote recently, Mueller should question Rep. Devin NunesDevin Gerald NunesBiden faces unfinished mission of evacuating Americans Nunes sues MSNBC, alleging Rachel Maddow defamed him Sunday shows preview: Bipartisan infrastructure talks drag on; Democrats plow ahead with Jan. 6 probe MORE (R-Calif.) and his staff about whether there was any collusion between those who issued the Nunes memo and Trump or any Trump associates involved with matters under investigation for potential crimes. There is desperation in the air around Trump, Nunes and their defenders. There is a profound fear of potential coming indictments or plea bargains achieved by Mueller that might already have happened and remain under seal, or will happen in the near future. There is desperation and fear in Trump circles about the prospect of Trump being questioned by Mueller and his special counsel team, which I predict Trump will never agree to, which would lead Mueller to issue subpoenas for Trump to testify before the grand jury, which, based on judicial precedents, will be approved by the courts. The Nunes memo will have zero practical effect because it has been so widely discredited, unless Trump uses it as a pretext to fire Rosenstein and Mueller, which would either lead to impeachment in the Republican House or Republicans losing a massive number of seats in the midterm elections. FBI Director Christopher Wray is a good and honorable leader of the FBI, which is a noble and professional organization that protects our citizens from terrorists and criminals and defends our nation from hostile powers, including Russia, that seek to destroy our democracy. What Trump and Nunes have done is shameless and wrong and greatly damages our country. What Wray can do by employing the nuclear option of guaranteeing he will resign if Trump fires Rosenstein or Mueller will either prevent the grave constitutional danger that is fast approaching or make it clear to Republicans in Congress that the consequences to them will be disastrous if they do not act now.

The report's message: Climate change is real, it is intensifying, and it will devastate the way human beings live day-to-day if U.S. leaders at all levels don't take drastic action. The latest congressionally mandated report, dubbed the Fourth National Climate Assessment, finds that the effects of climate change are rippling out across the globe, negatively affecting people's health and well-being. More than 300 federal and nonfederal scientists worked on the report, the first of its kind under the Trump administration, with its final draft reviewed by 13 federal agencies. Here are five things to know about the report's findings. The report directly contradicts statements made by Trump President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE in recent months has doubled down on his skepticism surrounding climate change, accusing scientists of harboring political agendas. Climate scientist Phil Duffy in an interview with The Hill said the report is \"remarkable\" because it presents a \"parallel universe\" within the administration — on the one hand, there are the \"federal agencies ... who are with the mainstream scientific consensus,\" and on the other, Trump says he isn't sure if climate change is \"man-made.\" The report estimates that about 92 percent of climate change can be attributed to the harmful effects of human actions. \"Earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities,\" the report reads. Confronted by Axios reporters earlier this month on the issue, Trump acknowledged there is climate change. \"Will it change back? Probably, that’s what I think,\" he told reporters. But Gary Yohe, an economics professor and environmental studies professor who served on a National Academy of Sciences panel that reviewed the report, told The Hill that the climate will not \"change back.\" \"The president is wrong,\" he told The Hill. The report concludes that the effects of climate change cannot be reversed, but says that its worst effects can be mitigated through aggressive action at all levels. Its recommendations are at odds with Trump's deregulatory agenda The Trump administration has pursued a largely deregulatory agenda, reversing and rolling back standards that put limits on vehicle and power plant emissions, dismantling the application of the clean water standards in some places, and often giving preference to oil and coal over alternative energy sources. Meanwhile, the report warns that climate change will result in worsening water quality conditions and the highest temperatures ever recorded, emphasizing the need to reduce carbon emissions drastically. \"While the fourth national climate assessment doesn’t offer policy recommendations by design, the findings certainly make a convincing case that the White House should stop rolling back climate policies and recognize that a much larger-scale response is required to essentially keep people safe,\" Brenda Ekwurzel, the director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, told The Hill. Derek Walker, vice president for U.S. Climate at Environmental Defense Fund, slammed the administration's agenda as \"malpractice.\" \"It’s kind of like a doctor who diagnoses a patient with a very serious disease where the cure is known and the doctor refuses to provide treatment,\" Walker told The Hill. \"It’s just malpractice.\" Dozens of environmental groups released similar statements following the report's release, with many dubbing it a \"call to action.\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement that the report is \"largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends.\" Katherine Hayhoe, one of the authors of the report, pushed back on that statement, calling it \"demonstrably false.\" \"I wrote the climate scenarios chapter myself so I can confirm it considers ALL scenarios, from those where we go carbon negative before end of century to those where carbon emissions continue to rise,\" she tweeted. Some claim the report's Black Friday release was intended to bury its findings The Trump administration came under fire on Friday for releasing the climate change report one day after Thanksgiving, when fewer Americans are likely to read the news. The report was originally slated for a December release, but it was ultimately moved up with little explanation. Yohe said representatives from the National Academy of Sciences told him on Wednesday that the report would be released this week. He alleged that the Trump administration decided on the release date as part of a political strategy aimed at burying the report's findings. \"This report gets submitted to the administration and they get to decide what to do with it,\" Yohe pointed out. \"This is truly a Black Friday, but for all the wrong reasons,\" said Aimee Delach, senior policy analyst for climate adaptation with the Defenders of Wildlife. The White House did not respond to The Hill's questions about the timing of the report's release. In a statement, Walters touted the United States's efforts to reduce carbon emissions and pointed out the report was assembled in part during the Obama administration. The assessment has been in the works for three years. Sen. Sheldon WhitehouseSheldon WhitehouseClimate hawks pressure Biden to replace Fed chair Democrats face big decision on agriculture in climate change fight The 'infrastructure deal' America must make with itself MORE (D-R.I.) said in a statement that the report's findings could not be buried \"no matter how hard they try.\" \"Serious consequences like collapsing coastal housing prices and trillions of dollars in stranded fossil fuel assets await us if we don’t act,\" he said. Climate change could slash up to 1/10th of America's GDP by 2100 The report assigns specific expenses to the monumental effects of a warming planet, finding that climate change could slash up to a 10th of America's gross domestic product by 2100. Damaging weather alone, it says, has cost the U.S. nearly $400 billion since 2015, and those costs are only expected to increase. “Annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century — more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states,” the report says. Rising sea levels and damaging storms will lower property values. Floods, hurricanes and wildfires will cost record amounts to recover from. Extreme heat could result in the loss over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 just in the southeast. \"If we went a lower [carbon] emissions pathway in the labor sector, we could cut those costs by nearly a half,\" Ekwurzel said. The report predicts that heat-related deaths could cost up to $141 billion, sea level rises could cost $118 billion and infrastructure damage could cost $32 billion by the end of the century. \"The report concludes that these climate-related impacts will only get worse and their costs could mount dramatically if carbon emissions continue unabated,\" Ekwurzel said. Climate change will have devastating impact on marginalized communities Climate scientists have said for decades that marginalized populations, particularly those in low-income communities and often people of color, will be the first and hardest hit by climate change's effects. Communities with little money and few resources are the most vulnerable to the risks associated with increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, worsening air and water quality, and infrastructure damage. Climate change does not affect everyone equally, the report says. \"Risks are often highest for those that are already vulnerable, including low-income communities, some communities of color, children, and the elderly,\" the report reads. \"Climate change threatens to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities that result in higher exposure and sensitivity to extreme weather and climate-related events and other changes.\" \"Climate change is really bad if you’re young, old, elderly and sick, or very poor,\" Yohe said. \"Because you’re more sensitive to the manifestations of climate change and you have much smaller ability to protect yourself.\" He added that human beings who are able to, will often attempt to adapt to dramatic weather conditions. \"Those investments are sometimes expensive, sometimes require a degree of sophistication and knowledge, and an ability to take some time off to figure out what you’re going to do to protect yourself,\" Yohe said. But, when they cannot adapt, people may be displaced by extreme weather scenarios, leaving them acting as \"refugees in their own country,\" Walker said. Though it does not lay out policy recommendations, the report says the worst-case scenarios don't have to transpire. According to the report, such possibilities can be mitigated or even prevented if leaders work to direct their attention toward the existential threat. \"People should take away that what we have now is not the new normal but it is a snapshot of a pathway to what will ultimately become the new normal,\" Yohe said. \"And there’s still plenty of time to pick which new normal we want.\" View the discussion thread.

Ron WydenRonald (Ron) Lee WydenConservation group says it will only endorse Democrats who support .5T spending plan Five big questions after millions lose federal unemployment aid Labor Day: No justice for whistleblowers MORE (Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, on Thursday introduced legislation to end tax breaks for private prison companies. Wyden described the bill as a response to President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE's immigration policies. “The private prison industry is booming, particularly with the Trump administration holding more immigrants in detention than any time over nearly the past 20 years. Companies that profit off of putting children in cages shouldn’t get tax breaks,” Wyden said in a statement. “My proposal is simple. Companies that make money from the Trump administration’s inhumane immigration policy and a criminal justice system that disproportionately imprisons people of color are going to pay taxes like any other corporation.” Private prison companies are often organized as real estate investment trusts (REITs) — whose gains from real estate holdings are not taxed at the corporate level and are only taxed at the individual level when the REITs' shareholders receive dividends. Under Wyden's bill, companies that run private prisons and immigration detention centers would not be able to receive status as REITs and would have to pay taxes at both the corporate and shareholder levels. Wyden has also introduced a version of this bill in the last Congress, along with Rep. Gregory MeeksGregory Weldon MeeksDefense & National Security: The post-airlift evacuation struggle Overnight Defense & National Security — Blinken heads to the hot seat Blinken to appear at House hearing on Afghanistan next week MORE (D-N.Y.). Democrats in recent years have expressed interest in closing private prisons as part of an overhaul of the criminal justice system, with the 2016 Democratic Party platform calling for the closure of private detention centers. Since Trump has taken office, liberals have particularly scrutinized private-prison companies because of their role in immigration detention. A spokesperson for The GEO Group, a private prison company, criticized Wyden's bill and said that the company doesn't advocate for any specific immigration policies. “Contract services providers are not the problem,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our company does not manage facilities that house unaccompanied minors, and we play absolutely no role in passing immigration or criminal justice laws and have never advocated for or against any immigration enforcement or criminal justice policies.\" \"Our company has operated legally as a Real Estate Investment Trust under a private letter ruling issued by the Internal Revenue Service in 2013 under the Obama Administration, and the services our company provides to the federal government today are in no way different than the high-quality services we provided for eight years under the Obama Administration,\" the spokesperson added. \"This legislation is an old, tired attack based on false narratives and myths and represents an attempt to enact immigration and criminal justice policies through the federal tax code.” Wyden has been offering a series of tax bills in recent weeks, including those to curb tax breaks for donations designed to influence the college admissions process, end the carried interest tax breaks benefiting investment-fund managers and make it easier for those with student loan debt to save for retirement. -- Updated on June 14 at 9:42 a.m. View the discussion thread.

Moscow Mitch says that he is the Grim Reaper,\" Pelosi said at an event in Illinois while decrying McConnell's moves to block House Democrats' legislation. \"Imagine describing yourself as the Grim Reaper, that he’s going to bury all this legislation.\" McConnell in April vowed to be the \"Grim Reaper\" for progressive policy proposals. Meanwhile, he has fiercely pushed back against the criticism he received for his moves to block the election security legislation. He said in a Senate floor speech in July that his detractors were engaging in \"modern-day McCarthyism.\" He also argued that the bills were partisan in nature and that the Trump administration has made a concerted effort to secure the nation's elections. \"These pundits are lying, lying when they dismiss the work that has been done. They’re lying when they insist I have personally blocked actions which, in fact, I have championed and the Senate has passed. They are lying when they suggest that either party is against defending our democracy,\" he said during the Senate floor speech.

The tweet comes amid calls to boycott fitness chains SoulCycle and Equinox because the company's chairman, Stephen Ross, is hosting a fundraiser for Trump on Friday. \"Hey, while everyone seems to be on this Equinox thing, it might be a good time to mention that one of Trump’s largest financial contributors is the chairman of Marvel Entertainment (Isaac Perlmutter)..... jussayin,\" Hammer tweeted. Hey, while everyone seems to be on this Equinox thing, it might be a good time to mention that one of Trump’s largest financial contributors is the chairman of Marvel Entertainment (Isaac Perlmutter)..... jussayin. Perlmutter and his wife have donated almost $600,000 to Trump's presidential campaign in 2019, according to Federal Election Commission records. The Perlmutters also regularly donate to conservative causes. Several celebrities, such as Chrissy Teigen and Billy Eichner, have also led calls to boycott SoulCycle and Equinox. SoulCycle has distanced itself from Ross's politics, saying in a statement that \"no company profits are used to fund politicians.\" Hammer, who has not appeared in a Marvel movie, also often posts commentary about policy issues like gun reform on his Twitter feed. He voiced the character The Lone Ranger in the video game \"Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes\" in 2014, prior to Perlmutter's tenure.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Beneath the surface of Republican politics, there is an ominous and growing trepidation that the investigation of President Trump and his associates by special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI will result in indictments or plea bargains involving one or more Trump associates during the coming year. My view is that the odds are 90 percent that between now and November 2018, there will be at least one major plea bargain agreement reached between the special counsel and a high-level associate of Trump and at least one major indictment and probably more resulting from the investigation that has relentlessly advanced in recent weeks. President Trump has charged that former President Obama “tapped” him at Trump Towers, a charge that has been repeated by various critics of the investigation. The charge that Obama spied on Trump is false. The truth is that, going back to 1917, Russia spied on America, and America spied on Russia. In recent decades President Reagan spied on Russia. President George H.W. Bush spied on Russia. President Clinton spied on Russia. President George W. Bush spied on Russia. Then, President Obama spied on Russia. Every leader of American democracy spied against every leader of the Russian dictatorship who attacked our democracy, as Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has attacked and continues to attack American and Western democracy today. American intelligence and law enforcement officials agree that Russian dictator Putin launched an aggressive attack against American democracy, most recently designed to elect Trump and defeat Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonHoward Stern rips vaccine opponents: 'F--- their freedom, I want my freedom to live' New Hampshire Democrat wins GOP-held state House seat Clinton thrilled to have Joan Allen recording her new book MORE. In response, American intelligence and law enforcement officials have launched an equally aggressive counterattack to defend American democracy, and, if any Americans colluded or conspired with this Russian attack, to prosecute them before a court of law. President Obama did not tap or spy against President Trump. Obama spied on Putin, not Trump, but if Trump’s voice is heard on any recording of any Russian attacking our democracy, he would have nothing to fear unless he did something legally wrong, which I am NOT suggesting. The same is true of any Trump associate who ever talked to any Russian in any of the unusually large number of meetings and discussions that Trump associates had with Russians who were attacking American democracy. I believe completely there are conversations involving Trump associates and Russians who were being closely monitored by American intelligence and law enforcement long before Trump ran for president. The odds are very high that those conversations led to warrants being issued leading to eavesdropping on one or more Trump associates that resulted from the legal and essential American counterespionage against Russians who were attacking our democracy. Whether any Trump associates were ultimately targets of warrants and whether they are ultimately indicted or accept plea bargains with the special counsel depends on what they said or did in their meetings with the Russians. If warrants were granted by independent courts and during the period when those warrants were in effect, Trump associates talked to Trump, those conversations would have been legally and appropriately swept in. Neither Trump nor the Trump associates who may have been legally and appropriately overheard have anything to fear unless they said or did anything legally wrong. It is obvious that special counsel Robert Mueller and his team have moved into a very aggressive phase of their investigation. The almost daily revelations surrounding the Russia scandal have begun again. There has been news of a no-knock warrant executed against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and news that Manafort has been under surveillance for some time. A treasure trove of new evidence surrounding the Russian attack against America through social media may or may not provide evidence of collusion and conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian attack against America. Obama did not spy against Trump. He did exactly the same thing that was done by a long succession of Republican and Democratic presidents. The enemy of the American people is not the free press. It is the Russian attacks against us. We will soon learn more about what Trump and his associates knew and when they knew it. Whether anyone is charged or convicted will depend on the evidence and the law, which is how things are done in America, unlike Russia. Brent Budowsky was an aide to former Sen.

All Rights Reserved House Democrats are pushing for an investigation into a contract signed by a small Montana-based energy company to help restore Puerto Rico’s electrical grid. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the ranking member on the House Natural Resources Committee, said Democrats have “pushed for a full investigation of some sort” into Whitefish Energy’s agreement to repair Puerto Rico’s hurricane-damaged energy infrastructure. “I think there’s more digging to be done,” Grijalva said Tuesday. “We’re looking at it; we pushed for a full investigation of some sort.” The Washington Post reported Monday on the $300 million contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which Whitefish Energy signed last week to help the island recover from Hurricane Maria. Whitefish is a two-year-old company that had only two employees when Maria struck Puerto Rico last month. As of Monday, it said it had 280 employees in Puerto Rico, mostly contractors.

Zinke met with committee members on Capitol Hill Tuesday, but the topic of the discussion was classified and lawmakers coming out of the meeting wouldn’t say what it was about. Grijalva said that “85 percent of the meeting ended up being dominated by this topic,” though he suggested the “classified hearing could have been in front of the full committee.” He said his staff is working to bring Zinke back to the Hill for a meeting to discuss “substantive issues” involving the Interior Department, including Whitefish Energy, the agency’s Antiquities Act review, staffing and other topics.

He also said he would take the blame for that shutdown if it occurs. “I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,” Trump told Schumer. “I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it.” Stokols also said Tuesday on \"Hardball\" that Trump was frustrated with Schumer following the meeting. \"His old New York sparring buddy, he felt, got the better of him,\" Stokols said.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved It’s official: The Trump campaign colluded with Russia. In an explosive development, the Biden administration confirmed that a Russian government agent with close connections to Donald Trump’s top 2016 campaign official “provided the Russian Intelligence Services with sensitive information on polling and [Trump] campaign strategy.” This revelation demolishes, once and for all, Trump’s ceaseless claims that he was the victim of the “greatest witch hunt in the history of our country.” (Recall that a Trump appointee directed Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerSenate Democrats urge Garland not to fight court order to release Trump obstruction memo Why a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel MORE to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE.”) But just how valuable was the polling and campaign strategy data that Paul ManafortPaul John ManafortDOJ investigating one-time Trump campaign adviser over alleged ties to Qatar: report Foreign lobbyists donated over M during 2020 election: report Former Mueller prosecutor representing Donoghue in congressional probes: report MORE, Trump’s campaign chairman, gave to a Russian agent? According to Brad ParscaleBrad ParscaleAides tried to get Trump to stop attacking McCain in hopes of clinching Arizona: report MORE, Trump’s election data guru, the information that Manafort handed directly to Russian intelligence was of critical importance, determining “98 percent” of the campaign’s resource allocations (such as spending on TV, radio and social media ads, rallies, field operations, and so on). Indeed, the data was so important that Parscale kept a visualization of the information on his iPad at all times, allowing him to tell then-candidate Trump where to conduct his next rally at a moment’s notice. According to the then-Republican-led Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the ultrasensitive campaign information that Manafort passed to a Russian spy “identified voter bases in blue-collar, democratic-leaning states which Trump could swing,” including in “Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota.” Moreover, the Russian intelligence officer who received the information “was capable of comprehending the complex polling data.” That leaves a lot of unanswered questions as to what Russia’s spies did with the information. Perhaps worse, Trump ultimately pardoned Manafort. Trump’s potential political rivals would be wise to remember that he handed the ultimate political favor to the man who colluded with Russia amid Moscow’s campaign to undermine American democracy. But Manafort’s malfeasance fits a broader pattern. As former Trump adviser Steve BannonStephen (Steve) Kevin BannonHouse panel probing Jan. 6 attack seeks Trump records Has Trump beaten the system?

At the time, Flynn’s previous links to Russia made him the target of a counterintelligence probe, thoroughly justifying the FBI’s investigation into his collusive calls with a senior Russian government official. Perhaps worst of all, Trump’s political allies released sensitive document after sensitive document in a desperate — and ill-fated — bid to score cheap political points for their boss. Among other damaging revelations, these selective, politically driven leaks of once highly classified information gave America’s adversaries an intimate look into how America’s secretive spy catchers conduct their work. The long-term damage to national security and to America’s counterintelligence efforts will be debated for years to come. Ultimately, it took five years to finally learn that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. While the Republicans and conservative media outlets that peddled falsehood after falsehood are dealt a decisive blow, one must wonder what other revelations will come to light in the months and years to come.

All Rights Reserved Three members of a white supremacist group were sentenced on Friday to prison time over violence at a 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., as well as other rallies in California. Benjamin Daley, Michael Miselis and Thomas Gillen each received a sentence between two and three years, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia said in a statement Friday. Daley was sentenced to 37 months in prison, while Gillen received 33 months and Miselis received 27 months. Each man is between the ages of 25 and 30. A fourth defendant, Cole Evan White, will be sentenced at a later date, the statement said. “These defendants, motivated by hateful ideology, incited and committed acts of violence in Charlottesville, as well at other purported political rallies in California,” U.S. Attorney Thomas Cullen said in the statement. “They were not interested in peaceful protest or lawful First Amendment expression; instead, they intended to provoke and engage in street battles with those that they perceived as their enemies.” The men were members of the Rise Above Movement, a white supremacist group that no longer exists, according to officials. The men attended two rallies in California as well as the August 2017 Charlottesville rally, where Daley and Miselis were found to have assaulted protesters and other individuals, the Justice Department said. “Violence erupted among the crowd, with some punching, kicking, spraying chemical irritants and swinging torches,” the attorney’s office said. They “collectively pushed, punched, kicked, chocked, head-butted, and otherwise assaulted several individuals, resulting in a riot.” Special Agent in Charge David Archey of the FBI said the sentences “demonstrate the U.S. Government’s intolerance of the use of violence, by anyone, to infringe upon the right of others to assemble peacefully.” Earlier this month, the man already sentenced to life in prison on federal hate crime charges for killing one person and injuring dozens more during the Charlottesville rally was further sentenced to life plus 419 years on state murder and wounding charges.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved A growing number of Republican lawmakers are refusing to say that the Jan. 6 insurrection was actually an insurrection. Nearly two dozen GOP House members voted against legislation this week that would award Congressional Gold Medals to police officers who defended the Capitol that day, in part because it describes the mob of then-President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE’s supporters who were trying to stop Congress from ratifying the 2020 election results as “insurrectionists.” “They were protesting.

Greene, Roy fined for not wearing masks on House floor Sixth House GOP lawmaker issued K metal detector fine Kentucky GOP lawmaker deletes tweet comparing vaccine mandates to Holocaust MORE (R-Ky.). “My goodness. Can you imagine what a real insurrection would look like?” he asked. The lack of consensus among members of Congress about how to describe the Jan. 6 attack underscores how difficult it is for lawmakers to take actions such as establishing a bipartisan commission to investigate the day’s events, as well as the pervasiveness of GOP attempts to whitewash the severity of the violent attack on the Capitol. Multiple news organizations, including The Hill, began referring to the events of Jan. 6 as an insurrection, broadly defined as an act of revolt against an established government, while they were still unfolding. Following a \"Stop the Steal\" rally in Washington headlined by Trump and scheduled to coincide with Congress's certification of November's Electoral College results, hundreds of supporters of the former president stormed the Capitol to prevent the formal count and transfer of power. Seven people died in connection with the ensuing violence, including two suicides in the following days, and more than 520 have since been charged with offenses ranging from assault to unlawful entry — though none have been charged with sedition thus far. The article of impeachment against Trump that the House passed after the riot, which fell short of conviction in the Senate, specifically referred to his actions as “incitement of insurrection” and “willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States.” While the House passed legislation to award medals to the Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police overwhelmingly with broad support from both parties on Tuesday, a group of 21 Republicans voted against it in part because they believed its use of the term “insurrectionists” and description of the Capitol as the “temple of our American democracy” went overboard. “You know what, police officers deserve to be awarded without having language in there that is offensive.

Rep.

Metropolitan Police that conspicuously makes no specific mention of the Jan. 6 riot. Gohmert's bill states that Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood of the Capitol Police, as well as Jeffrey Smith of the Metropolitan Police, “all passed in January 2021” without noting what event led to their deaths. By contrast, Gohmert’s bill then goes on to specify that Capitol Police Officer William “Billy” Evans was killed on April 2 “while protecting the north barricade of the Capitol\" from a vehicle-based attack. Gohmert said that his version “serves as a tribute to our officers rather than using them as political pawns.” During a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing last month, Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) declared that “it was not an insurrection.” “There was an undisciplined mob; there were some rioters and some who committed acts of vandalism,” Clyde said, going on to add, in remarks sharply criticized by Democrats, that one scene of rioters walking between stanchions in Statuary Hall looked like a “normal tourist visit.” Days later, Sen. Ron JohnsonRonald (Ron) Harold JohnsonInternal poll shows Barnes with 29-point lead in Wisconsin Democratic Senate primary Wisconsin Democratic Senate candidate facing 4 felony charges Why can't we mandate anything? MORE (R-Wis.) similarly denied that the Jan. 6 riot should be called an insurrection and said it was largely a “peaceful protest.” “Even calling it an insurrection, it wasn't,” Johnson said during an interview with Fox’s “Ingraham Angle.” “You know, I condemned the breach. I condemned the violence, but to say there were thousands of armed insurrectionists breaching the Capitol intent on overthrowing the government is just simply false narrative.” “By and large, it was peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said. Law enforcement found a variety of weapons on the rioters, including knives, bear spray, stun guns and a spear. At least four people have been charged with firearms offenses.

When the Senate came back into session to finish the Electoral College count on the night of Jan. 6, McConnell called the attack a “failed insurrection.” And in a “Fox News Sunday” interview on April 25, McCarthy said, “you had an insurrection at the Capitol.” But when a reporter asked McConnell at a press conference last week if he defined the events of Jan. 6 as an insurrection, he was less direct. “Look, I've said a lot about that already. I said it on January 6th, I said it again February 13th. I've covered that comprehensively and I really don't think there's anything I could add,” McConnell said. Trump’s own lawyers during his impeachment trial in February offered conflicting opinions about whether the attack on the Capitol amounted to an insurrection. One of his attorneys, Bruce Castor, argued on Feb. 12 that “clearly, there was no insurrection.” “‘Insurrection’ is a term of art defined in the law, and it involves taking over a country, a shadow government, taking the TV stations over, and having some plan on what you are going to do when you finally take power. Clearly, this is not that,” Castor said. But a day later, another member of Trump’s defense team, Michael van der Veen, stated: “The question before us is not whether there was a violent insurrection of the Capitol. On that point, everyone agrees.” View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved In the print edition of this week’s Hollywood Reporter, I took out a full-page ad titled “Hollywood rises for hope against fear.” Across America, from campuses to churches, from union halls to town meetings, from Hollywood to Main Street, Americans are rising and will soon be voting against the hate, fear and lies that President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE pedals in his closing argument of his bitterly divisive midterm election campaign. The point of my Hollywood Reporter ad is to applaud those throughout the creative community who have risen to the occasion during our national crisis with a generosity of spirit and the courage of their convictions, reviving the spirit that inspired Frank Sinatra and countless others who supported President Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Last April, as America was remembering and honoring Dr. King, I wrote a column applauding a moving interview by Victor Blackwell with Martin Luther King III on CNN's New Day Saturday. Dr. King’s son lifted CNN viewers by discussing how the noble dream of his father remains alive today. Several weeks earlier, Dr. King’s 9-year-old granddaughter, Yolanda Renee King, electrified hundreds of thousands of citizens marching in Washington for the right of students to be free from being mass murdered in their classrooms, with these words: \"Spread the word. Have you heard? All across the nation. We are going to be a great generation.\" Next week, voters will determine who we are as a people and what we stand for as a nation. In recent days, bombs were sent to: The man who sent these bombs wore the \"Make America Great Again\" hat the president favors, cheered at rallies where Trump tells supporters whom to hate, and he aimed his bombs at those Trump tells supporters are evil. Even after the alleged bomb-mailer was arrested, instead of calling the targets of the bombs to express the decency and solidarity of the nation, Trump continues to vilify the bombs' targets and call the free press the enemy of the people. Now, the closing argument of Trump Republicans in the midterm campaign is to rouse supporters via hatred for the free press and fear of a migrant caravan that the man who committed mass murder in a synagogue claims, like the president, is invading America. Trump, who spent years spreading the birther lie against President Obama, now escalates his insults of Hispanics by escalating his attacks against birthright citizenship guaranteed under law by the Constitution. Voters will soon have the opportunity to vote for hope over hate by supporting one of the most talented and compelling groups of Democrats in memory running in the midterm elections. Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams (D), who is receiving a powerful boost as Oprah Winfrey campaigns with her, is running with dignity and honor to make history as governor of Georgia against one of the massive and heinous attacks against voting rights since the dark days of the segregated South. Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), who, according to one recent poll, may be the closing the gap against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the closing days of the campaign while early voting in Texas has surged to historic numbers, is running a profile-in-courage campaign to serve as senator from Texas. Gavin Newsom, current lieutenant governor of California, honors the legacy of his hero, Robert Kennedy, in his campaign for governor of California, while Democrats running for Congress in California and elsewhere have a strong chance of regaining control of the House. Andrew Gillum, current mayor of Tallahassee, Fla., is running a noble, brilliant campaign to make history and serve as the next governor of Florida. Democratic men and women who have been heroes defending freedom in uniform are running for Congress with high ideals and great aspirations in districts across America. Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.), who is a living embodiment of the values and visions I tried to describe in my Hollywood Reporter ad, is campaigning for Democrats throughout the land. The midterm elections offer voters a referendum. They can purge the poison that infects politics in Washington and support Democrats who offer a unifying, healing and uplifting vision for America. Or, they can give one-party power to Republicans who practice a politics of attack and derision that appeals to the lesser instincts of our nature and would make our nation a house bitterly divided against itself.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The United States Capitol Police has suspended six officers and is investigating a total of nearly 30 others in connection with their actions responding to the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The department said in a statement shared with The Hill on Friday that the Capitol Police’s Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating a total of 35 officers, and that “Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman has directed that any member of her department whose behavior is not in keeping with the Department’s Rules of Conduct will face appropriate discipline.\" Fox’s Washington, D.C., affiliate, WTTG, first reported the investigations Thursday and CNN also reported that additional probes may take place as investigators look through social media posts and allegations that officers may have been involved in the riot itself. The suspensions and investigations come amid increased scrutiny over the Capitol Police’s response to the mob attack, in which multiple people died amid the chaos, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. Two additional officers who responded to the rioting have since died by suicide. Capitol Police last month, in the days following the siege, confirmed it was investigating the actions of some of its officers, with Pittman saying in a statement at the time that the department was “actively reviewing video and other open source materials of some USCP officers and officials that appear to be in violation of Department regulations and policies.” “Our Office of Professional Responsibility will investigate these behaviors for disciplinary action, up to, and including, termination,” Pittman added. “Several USCP officers have already been suspended pending the outcome of their investigations.” Pittman took over as acting head of the department after former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund announced he would resign amid lawmaker pressure the day following the breach of the Capitol.

Members of the Capitol Police last week issued an anticipated vote of no confidence in its top leaders over the Jan. 6 riot, including Pittman, two assistant chiefs, three deputy chiefs and a captain of the division that staffs the Capitol.

Amash, who recently switched his party affiliation to Libertarian, tweeted Sunday that the bill would \"correct\" what he claims to be an error made by the Supreme Court when it established the doctrine of qualified immunity. Qualified immunity protects government officials, including police officers, from lawsuits alleging they violated a plaintiff's rights unless a “clearly established” right has been violated. In practice, the doctrine blocks most lawsuits against individual police officers. \"This week, I am introducing the Ending Qualified Immunity Act to eliminate qualified immunity and restore Americans’ ability to obtain relief when police officers violate their constitutionally secured rights,\" he wrote.

Police conduct has been roundly criticized in recent days following bystander video that surfaced of Floyd's death. The footage showed a former officer, Derek Chauvin, placing his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes despite Floyd's constant plea for air. Chauvin has since been charged with third-degree murder for his actions, while activists and some lawmakers have called for three other officers fired over the incident to be charged as well. Elsewhere in the U.S., police response to protests over Floyd's death in major cities has also been criticized, including video of officers appearing to ram a crowd of protesters with a police cruiser in New York City.

Something is happening in America that has never happened before. A president of the United States is campaigning for his claim that he is above the law of the United States. He campaigns against political opponents and leading law enforcement agencies by claiming they should be investigated and prosecuted by agencies he seeks to command at will. Trump and his attorneys have made assertions of presidential power that are akin to the powers of foreign monarchs and dictators. He makes Richard Nixon look like a civil libertarian by comparison. They have asserted that the investigation of special counsel Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerSenate Democrats urge Garland not to fight court order to release Trump obstruction memo Why a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel MORE is unconstitutional.

Listen to Donald Trump MORE, Deputy Attorney General Rod RosensteinRod RosensteinWashington still needs more transparency House Judiciary to probe DOJ's seizure of data from lawmakers, journalists The Hill's Morning Report - Biden-Putin meeting to dominate the week MORE and FBI Director Christopher Wray at will. They claim Trump has the power to unilaterally close down all investigations of Russian attacks against America and fire every official and agent conducting the investigation. Trump claims the power to pardon all suspects and defendants in the investigation and cases brought under the investigation. He claims the power to pardon himself of all crimes he might someday be charged with. He issues pardons with the obvious intent of inducing suspects and defendants to not cooperate with the special counsel. Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, in one of the most nauseating and legally ignorant assertions ever offered by any attorney for any president, stated that Trump could murder former FBI Director James Comey without fear of indictment. Trump has pressured the Justice Department to wield the power of the state to initiate investigations of political opponents, including Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonHoward Stern rips vaccine opponents: 'F--- their freedom, I want my freedom to live' New Hampshire Democrat wins GOP-held state House seat Clinton thrilled to have Joan Allen recording her new book MORE. The criminalization of political opposition is one of the time-honored tactics of monarchs and dictators through the ages. Trump has accused federal agencies investigating the Russian attack against America of being criminals working for what he called a “Criminal Deep State.\" This criminalization of American counterintelligence agencies investigating the Russian attack on American elections is not only an assertion of monarchical and dictatorial power. It is also an assertion that actively helps a foreign dictator while he continues to attack our country, by attacking those who investigate his crimes. Think about this: While intelligence agencies warn that the Russian attack against America is now aimed at our midterm elections, Trump attacks the investigators of this crime while he campaigns for Republicans in the midterms. I recently wrote that the Justice Department inspector general should condemn these attacks against the rule of law. I also recently wrote that if Trump continues his war against Mueller, he will cause a humongous surge in Democratic turnout in the midterms. Day after day, step by step, Trump claims powers never before claimed by any president. This is alien to American and democratic traditions, values and laws. Trump is claiming that he is above the law and that as president he can commit any crime without any legal or judicial review. This is how kings rule. This is how dictators act. Republican leaders in Congress and law professors commenting in the media should unequivocally denounce these radical assertions of presidential power. Leaders of both parties and legal authorities of all persuasions should speak out, loudly, as one, against this. In American democracy, our system of justice has the final say on the rule of law. Voters have the final say about who governs the nation. The midterm elections in 2018 are the most important midterms in American history. Midterm voters can end a one-party state in Washington ruled by someone who often praises foreign monarchs and dictators and increasingly acts as they do in their nations. Midterm voters can assert the truth that no president is above the law. Midterm voters can demand that their president respects the rule of law. Midterm voters can take America back from a president who claims powers that no president should ever claim. Brent Budowsky was an aide to former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and former Rep.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Having signed a flurry of executive orders, President Trump will soon shift his attention to Congress as he tries to push through an ambitious agenda, including an overhaul of ObamaCare, a border wall and a massive infrastructure package. The White House won't only be working back channels with congressional leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers. Allies say Trump will likely bring his bully pulpit on the road, holding campaign-style events that specifically target vulnerable Democrats in red states like Montana and West Virginia. Then there's his Twitter account: Hill Republicans say Trump will have no problem singling out through social media lawmakers he feels are standing in the way of his agenda. \"He's going to take names. He’s going to look at the people who are supportive and who aren’t,\" Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), one of the few Republicans who has at times criticized Trump, told The Hill. \"I suspect he will be rigorous in calling attention to those he believes are hampering his legislative efforts.\" Since taking office two weeks ago, Trump has turned to the same no-holds-barred approach that won him legions of fans on the campaign trail, picking fights with the media, Democratic protesters, foreign leaders and corporations sending jobs overseas. So far, the new president has been much more reserved when it comes to going after lawmakers. But several Republicans said it’s only a matter of time before Trump cracks the whip on Capitol Hill. He’s already given rank-and-file lawmakers a taste of what could be coming if they don’t fall in line. Last month, a series of tweets from Trump derailed House Republicans’ plans to gut an independent congressional ethics office. And just last week, Trump launched a blistering attack on Sens. John McCainJohn Sidney McCainWhat the chaos in Afghanistan can remind us about the importance of protecting democracy at home 'The View' plans series of conservative women as temporary McCain replacements In Afghanistan, we've opened the gates of hell MORE (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey GrahamLindsey Olin GrahamFlorida Democrat becomes latest breakthrough COVID-19 case in House Graham says US 'will be going back' to Afghanistan McConnell: Biden 'is not going to be removed from office' MORE (R-S.C.), tweeting that they’re “weak on immigration” and “always looking to start World War III” after the senators slammed his executive order on refugees. Those types of personal attacks from Trump are certain to fire up his loyalists and could inspire primary challenges to his GOP targets. “He could whip votes from Twitter,” said Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio), who saw Trump personally get involved in his state’s GOP chairmanship race to defeat the handpicked candidate of rival Gov. John Kasich (R), a onetime presidential rival. “He’s definitely got an agenda and he wants to push it through. He’s going to use every arrow in his quiver to get those things accomplished.\" “When he gets focused on something and he wants to get it done, he gets after it. That’s definitely a lesson I learned,” Joyce continued. “An enraged Twitter finger could really hurt somebody.” But Trump allies predicted his interactions with the Hill wouldn’t be “all stick, no carrot.” Trump speaks regularly by phone to GOP congressional leaders, including Speaker Paul RyanPaul Davis RyanPaul Ryan says it's 'really clear' Biden won election: 'It was not rigged. It was not stolen' Democrats fret over Trump-district retirements ahead of midterms To cut poverty and solve the labor shortage, enhance the Earned Income Tax Credit MORE (R-Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). And in recent weeks, Trump and Vice President Pence have personally phoned senior and rank-and-file lawmakers as well, sources said. The president also is expected to regularly host lawmakers at White House dinners, meetings and other events following his recent kick-off reception with Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellCapitol Police warning of potential for violence during rally backing rioters: report The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Democrats face headwinds on .5 trillion plan, debt ceiling Yellen triggers alarm bells over debt ceiling cliff MORE (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Charles SchumerChuck SchumerRetail group backs minimum corporate tax, increased IRS enforcement House Democrats outline plan for transition to clean electricity Capitol Police warning of potential for violence during rally backing rioters: report MORE (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Hill leaders. “That’s more than the Obama people did,” said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a co-chairman of the centrist Tuesday Group. Trump’s legislative affairs team — which includes former top Hill aides Rick Dearborn, Marc Short and Paul Teller — has also begun reaching out to individual members and caucuses. They’re in the process of setting up meetings with groups, including the far-right House Freedom Caucus, conservative Republican Study Committee and Tuesday Group. “We’ve already been in discussions about having that meeting to understand where they are going,” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who campaigned with Trump last year, told The Hill. Still, GOP fissures are forming that could complicate or delay several top Trump priorities. Freedom Caucus leaders are aggressively calling for the repeal and wholesale replacement of ObamaCare, while GOP chairmen have argued a more measured “repair” of the healthcare law is the right approach. Meanwhile, top congressional Republicans have begun griping about the price tag of the wall Trump has pledged to build on the U.S.-Mexico border, estimated to cost between $12 billion to $15 billion. Many in his party are skeptical of Trump’s plan to have U.S. taxpayers foot the bill first, and then have Mexico reimburse the U.S. later. By spring, the White House is expected to send Congress a request for a supplemental funding bill to pay for the wall, but the details still are being worked out. Lawmakers are hoping to get more clarity from Trump on Feb. 28, when he addresses a joint session of Congress. One thing Trump — a billionaire business magnate, “Art of the Deal” author and reality-TV star — has going for him is he knows how to attract crowds. His often-unpredictable campaign events drew tens of thousands of people and cable-news viewers, giving him a potent platform. Trump could hop in Air Force One and stage campaign-style rallies in the backyards of red-state Democrats up for reelection in 2018, like Sens.

That way, he could pressure those Democrats to confirm his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, and pass his agenda. “That’s one of the things he can do to overcome the Senate filibuster. I think Trump can do more good there with his Twitter and his airplane,” conservative Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said in an interview. “Ronald Reagan did that over television very effectively, and Trump is at least that effective. “He can drop into Billings and Helena and you’ve got Montana covered. They are free thinking people out there.” Dent, however, warned that Trump should not get “too punitive” with lawmakers, whether they are Democrats or Republicans. Because the political outsider is not very ideological, he will be able to build different coalitions, depending on the issue. “Yesterday’s adversary is tomorrow’s ally and vice versa, depending on what the issue is,” Dent said. “The coalition could change from vote to vote and week to week. “It would not be productive to be overly punitive.” View the discussion thread.

All Rights Reserved Pope FrancisPope FrancisFormer cardinal charged following sexual assault allegations, pleads not guilty Pope, citing Putin, criticizes two-decade war in Afghanistan Pope says he's leading 'totally normal life' after surgery MORE is increasingly driving a wedge between conservatives and the Catholic Church. The magnetic pope has sparked new enthusiasm around the world for the church and has flexed his political muscles internationally, most recently by helping to engineer a new relationship between the United States and Cuba. But Francis’s agenda, which also includes calls to address income inequality and limit climate change, is putting him at odds with Republicans, including GOP Catholics in the United States. Hours after President Obama announced moves to ease trade and travel restrictions to Cuba, Sen. Marco RubioMarco Antonio RubioOvernight Hillicon Valley — Hacking goes global Rubio knocks CIA over consideration of TikTok presence Overnight Hillicon Valley — Pro-Chinese group tries to mobilize US protests MORE (R-Fla.), a practicing Catholic and potential 2016 presidential candidate, criticized the deal and Francis's role in it. “I would also ask His Holiness to take up the cause of freedom and democracy, which is critical for a free people, for a people to truly be free,” Rubio told reporters. Rubio said that Cubans “deserve the same chances to have democracy as the people of Argentina have had, where he comes from, as the people of Italy have, where he now lives.” His office declined additional comment for this story. Fellow Catholic Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) said he wished Francis would stand up for the Cuban people \"rather than their oppressors.\" “Sadly, in the case of Cuba, the Catholic Church has not always applied its basic principles of human dignity and reverence for the God-given freedoms that belong to every soul. I was supremely disappointed by press reports that the Pope had a hand in urging President Obama to cede crucial leverage that could have been used to help the Cuban people become free,” Diaz-Balart said. It's not the first time Francis has clashed with conservatives. Since his papal inauguration in March 2013, the pontiff has publicly made policy remarks about income inequality and the environment that many American Catholics weren't used to hearing coming from the Vatican, and not just from the pulpit. “Inequality is the root of social evil,” Francis tweeted in March, after months earlier slamming “trickle-down” economics as a “crude and naïve” theory. Next year, as part of a speech he’ll give to the United Nations General Assembly, Francis will issue an edict urging the world's 1.2 billion Catholics to do what they can to fight climate change. “He's modeling the church as a place for open disagreement,” said Vincent J. Miller, who chairs the University of Dayton's Catholic theology program. “In that sense, one of the most important changes he's making is that conservative politicians are now openly disagreeing with him,” Miller said. Catholics have long been considered an important voting block in American politics and have turned out for the winning presidential candidate in the last three cycles. A closer look at the Catholic vote reveals that white Catholics have supported the Republican candidate in each of those elections, while Hispanic Catholics have supported the Democratic candidate, according to Pew Research polling. According to Pew, Catholics made up 24 percent of the electorate in the 2014 cycle, voting for GOP House candidates over Democratic ones 54 percent to 45 percent. Francis himself enjoys a high favorability rating of 78 percent among all Americans, with only 11 percent disapproving of him and the remaining having no opinion, according to a Dec. 11 poll from Pew. Among Catholics, his favorability spikes to 93 percent. Miller said Republicans are no longer able to use issues like abortion and gay marriage as the defining issues for American Catholics. But Mauricio Claver-Carone, director of the conservative U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC, said that by injecting his beliefs, Francis has alienated Cuban-Americans who are deeply opposed to the communist Castro regime in Cuba. “I don't want the pope running the foreign policy of the United States, just as I don't think the president wants the pope running the social policy of the United States,” said Claver-Carone, referencing the pope’s anti-abortion rights views. Progressive Catholics, however, such as Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of NETWORK, a Catholic social justice organization, are cheering Francis on as he calls for the world's elite to do more to help the poor. “Oh my gloria, this is a definite change in tone from being a 'scolder-in-chief' to being the one who identifies with the pain in our world,” said Simone, who organized the “Nuns on a Bus” cross-country tours. “Pope Francis's message and tone are making Catholic Republicans a little uncomfortable,” Simone said. “He's stirring the concern on issues like poverty and the economy.” View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved It turns out, according to a shocking new book by former Democratic National Committee interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile, that the fix was in all along. The DNC had a secret deal with the Clinton campaign that made a mockery of the notion that the national party organization should be neutral in presidential primaries. It also turns out that from the day that Donald Trump was elected until now, the DNC has been guilty of gross negligence and incompetence that has shortchanged Democrats in every state and left the DNC lagging pathetically behind the Republican National Committee at one of the most important political moments in decades. The DNC owes Bernie SandersBernie SandersDavid Sirota: Pharmaceuticals will try to make Medicare proposal as limited as possible Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Democrats face headwinds on .5 trillion plan, debt ceiling MORE and his supporters an apology if it signed a secret deal in 2015 that sought to fix the 2016 nominating process. The DNC owes every Democrat and party candidates in every state an apology for failing to mobilize Democrats and better support Democratic candidates during an epic political struggle that will have gigantic impact on the nation after the 2018 midterm elections. Whatever the DNC does in the coming months, a wave of small progressive donors and large donors from Hollywood who support enlightened candidates and causes should engage in massive fundraising and organizing to elect Democrats — especially the highly regarded Democratic nominee to win the open Senate seat in Alabama, Doug Jones, against the horrifically far-right extremist, GOP nominee Roy Moore. The DNC should bring in a major new player with a proven record of party building, such as former DNC Chairman Howard Dean, to lead a powerful march to the 2018 midterms. It is immaterial whether anyone currently at the DNC stays or leaves. What matters is that someone like Dean, who was a superb chair of the DNC committed to party building in all 50 states, essentially becomes the DNC czar and is tasked with winning control of the House and Senate in the 2018 midterms. According to the new book by Brazile, excerpted in Politico, President Obama and his campaign had left the DNC with massive debt after the 2012 campaign, and in August 2015, almost a year before the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the DNC signed a secret deal with the Clinton campaign that gave Clinton virtual ownership over the DNC in return for raising money to pay off the debt. --- RELATED STORIES FROM THE HILL --- In other words, regarding the Democratic National Committee that should represent all Democrats equally and treat all candidates equally throughout presidential primaries, the fix was in before the 2016 primaries had even begun. Two points are key: First, the DNC has for some time been so incompetent and ineffective that any DNC-Clinton deal probably did not make much difference in the 2016 primaries. Second, and more importantly, this DNC-Clinton deal, if it happened as Brazile suggests, was a disgraceful and unethical venture that violated a core principle of the DNC: that it should be neutral in presidential primaries between competing candidates. The fiasco surrounding the inept DNC continues today. After Trump was elected, there has been a national wave of opposition and resistance that should have yielded a bonanza of fundraising by the DNC, helping Democratic initiatives across the land. It did not. Instead, throughout 2017, the DNC has lagged light years behind the Republican National Committee in fundraising, in cash on hand and in impact on national politics. By contrast, the Sanders-affiliated group, Our Revolution, has been mobilizing grass-roots workers and small-donor fundraising behind progressive causes and candidates. Our Revolution is focused, principled and fighting trim, while the DNC is backward, incompetent and largely irrelevant in the great battle unfolding in the U.S. between the dark politics of President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE and Americans working to bring about a post-Trump nation. For this, the DNC owes every Democrat across the nation a sweeping, comprehensive and humble apology. Democrats must no longer tolerate the ineptitude and irrelevance of the DNC and must demand dramatic changes, including and especially bringing in a major player such as Howard Dean to spearhead a national party campaign to end the one-party Republican control of the House and Senate. Regardless of the shenanigans of Washington-based Democrats at the DNC, the vast and powerful progressive base should move in overdrive, as it has already begun to do, in support of candidates such as Doug Jones in Alabama and Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), who has a fair chance of defeating Sen. Ted CruzRafael (Ted) Edward CruzChris Wallace on lawmakers who contested Biden's election: I don't want to hear 'their crap' Jimmy Kimmel jokes unvaccinated shouldn't get ICU bed Trump schedules rallies in Iowa, Georgia MORE (R-Texas). The incompetence of the DNC must end. The post-Trump era in America should begin as soon as possible. The way to make this happen is for Democrats to decisively win the midterm elections in 2018. The DNC must be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Brent Budowsky was an aide to former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and former Rep.

The DOJ argued against the documents' release, saying that they fell under FOIA exceptions for privileged information related to attorney-client communication and government deliberative decision making.

Jackson, who had been provided with a copy of the memo to review, rejected the government's arguments against disclosure, saying the document was not a typical product of an attorney providing legal advice to a client. She added that it indicated that charges against Trump had never even been considered in the first place among DOJ officials. Jackson also criticized Barr for his public statements about the process and the Mueller report in the weeks leading up to the release of the special counsel's investigation, writing, \"not only was the Attorney General being disingenuous then, but DOJ has been disingenuous to this Court with respect to the existence of a decision-making process that should be shielded by the deliberative process privilege.\" It's still unclear how the Biden administration's Justice Department will proceed with the case. Jackson on Friday granted the DOJ's request to extend its deadline for deciding whether to appeal the case from May 17 to May 24.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved House Republicans passed legislation on Thursday that would deny federal funds to sanctuary cities. The bill, passed 241-179, would withhold certain federal law enforcement grants to cities that have policies designed to shelter illegal immigrants from deportation. Sanctuary cities have come under heavy scrutiny in the wake of Kathryn Steinle’s death on July 1 in San Francisco. Authorities charged Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez with her killing. Lopez-Sanchez, who is in the U.S. illegally, has a history of felony convictions and has been deported five times. Critics of the sanctuary laws say such policies encourage people to immigrate to the U.S. illegally at the expense of citizens. “A refuge for whom? A sanctuary for whom?” Rep.

That is better than some of the senators he’s running against.” Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) said mockingly. Republicans denied that Trump had any influence on their decision to bring up the legislation. “This is a valid concern that we’re voting on today,” said Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who has often broken with his party on immigration in the past and said he finds Trump’s comments offensive. “I’m not going to let Donald Trump dictate my vote.” Five Republicans joined all but six Democrats in opposing the measure. The five Republicans who voted against the bill were Reps. Carlos Curbelo (Fla.), Bob Dold (Ill.), Dan Donovan (N.Y.), Pete King (N.Y.) and Dave ReichertDavid (Dave) George ReichertRep.

The sanctuary city debate centers on laws that are aimed at encouraging illegal immigrants to report crimes to the police without fear of deportation. Before Steinle’s death, the Federal Bureau of Prisons transferred Lopez-Sanchez to the San Francisco Police Department for an outstanding arrest warrant on drug charges. But San Francisco authorities dropped the charges and released Lopez-Sanchez weeks later despite a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to receive notification of his release because Lopez-Sanchez was prioritized for deportation. Democrats have argued that Lopez-Sanchez should have been deported even under the sanctuary statutes in San Francisco. A coalition of 21 big-city mayors criticized the House bill and warned that cutting off federal law enforcement grants would weaken public safety efforts. “Overbroad immigration enforcement undermines safety for all,” they wrote in a letter to lawmakers Thursday. “When immigrant residents can report crime without fear of deportation, immigrants are more willing to engage with local police and government institutions, our streets and neighborhoods are safer, and those who commit crime are more likely to be brought to justice.” The White House has threatened to veto the legislation, saying the proposal “undermines current administration efforts to remove the most dangerous convicted criminals” and doesn’t enact comprehensive immigration reform. Meanwhile, NumbersUSA, which advocates for less immigration, urged lawmakers to oppose the House bill because the group didn’t think it went far enough.

Golf.com reports Trump won the right to put the champion’s plaque on his locker at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida after wagering a nine-hole challenge to actual winner Ted Virtue, who took him up on his offer and ultimately lost. Trump reportedly offered the nine-hold challenge to Virtue after saying something like “the only reason you won is because I couldn’t play” due to time commitments as president. Trump beat Virtue in the one-on-one competition, but agreed to be co-champions with him. “This isn’t fair — we’ll be co-champions,” Trump said, according to Golf.com. The 2018 champion’s plaque marks the sixth on Trump’s locker, joining victories from the 1999, 2001 and 2009 tournaments. He is also listed as the senior champion from 2012 and 2013. Trump is known as an avid golfer who loves to play on his own courses, including in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey. He passed control and ownership of his multiple golf clubs and resorts to his adult sons when he became president. The Trump Organization, which owns and operates the course, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill. Club employees told Golf.com they could not discuss club matters.

The CNN poll found that 82 percent of registered voters who identified as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents listed climate change as a \"very important\" top priority they’d like to see get the focus of a presidential candidate. The poll is the first national survey to show climate change rising to the top of the ranks among issues Democrats plan to focus on in the 2020 election. In March polling of likely Democratic Iowa caucusgoers found that climate change was the No. 2 issue respondents wanted to hear candidates spend “a lot” of time talking about. Eighty percent of respondents to that poll listed climate change as the top issue while health care edged as the top concern with 81 percent. Only 14 percent of Republican voters in the same poll listed climate change as a major threat. Environmentalists have made strides in recent elections to link the effects of global warming and human and health. Recent super storms, historical fires and prevalent drought have helped push climate change to the forefront as a visible threat.

All Rights Reserved President BidenJoe BidenKentucky state lawmakers vote to scrap school mask mandate Arkansas governor pushes back against Biden's vaccine mandate RNC vows to sue over Biden vaccine, testing mandate MORE took a victory lap Saturday after the Senate passed his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, handing him his biggest legislative victory since he took office. “It’s a good day today. When we took office 45 days ago, I promised the American people help was on the way. Today, I can say we’ve taken one more giant step forward in delivering on that promise that help is on the way,” Biden said in remarks from the White House. The legislation passed Saturday in a 50-49 vote after a whirlwind session that lasted more than 24 hours. The package was passed via budget reconciliation, a process that allowed it to avoid a 60-vote filibuster. However, the bill first had to undergo a vote-a-rama, during which any senator could propose an amendment to change the legislation. The laborious process produced the longest vote in Senate history, but Biden touted it as necessary in the fight against the coronavirus. The package provides another round of stimulus checks, aid for state and local government, and more help for small businesses and schools, and it looks to bolster the nation’s growing vaccination effort. Many of those stimulus checks are now expected to go out this month after the legislation's passage in the Senate. “This plan puts us on a path to beating the virus. This plan gives those families who are struggling the most the help and the breathing room they need to get through this moment. This plan gives small businesses in this country a fighting chance to survive,” said Biden.

A deal was ultimately reached to extend the payments into September and make the first $10,200 in unemployment benefits tax-free for households with income of up to $150,000. Beyond the hang-up over unemployment benefits, the bill also left out language from the House-passed bill raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour and lowered the eligibility for individuals and families to receive stimulus checks. “It obviously wasn’t easy. It wasn’t always pretty, but it was so desperately needed, urgently needed,” Biden said. While the passage of the bill marks a major legislative milestone for Biden, Republicans lambasted it as a partisan maneuver that violated Biden’s vows to seek cooperation. “Voters handed Senate Democrats the slimmest possible majority, shrunk the House Democrats’ majority, and picked a president who promised unity and bipartisanship. Democrats have responded by ramming through what they call ‘the most progressive domestic legislation in a generation’ on razor-thin and purely partisan majorities in both chambers,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellCapitol Police warning of potential for violence during rally backing rioters: report The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Democrats face headwinds on .5 trillion plan, debt ceiling Yellen triggers alarm bells over debt ceiling cliff MORE (R-Ky.). Still, Biden maintained he would look for opportunities to work across the aisle on future legislative priorities. “There’s a lot of Republicans that came very close, got a lot of pressure on them, and I still haven’t given up on getting their support,” he said. The bill now heads back to the House for passage on the Senate version. The legislation is expected to pass, but progressives have grumbled over the changes made in the upper chamber — and some have even threatened they could pull their support. \"This trend is outrageous: Eliminating $15/hr Reducing thresholds for payments. ...Cuts to weekly payments What are we doing here?

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Jobless claims last week jumped to the highest level since the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. Roughly 253,000 Americans filed applications for unemployment benefits in the week ending Jan. 26, an increase of 53,000 from the previous week. U.S. economic activity tends to slow down after the holiday season as consumers cut back on spending and employers shed seasonal workers. But the increase in jobless claims also came near the end of a record-long government shutdown that's projected to cost the economy billions of dollars. Jobless claims fell 13,000 to 199,000 for the week ending Jan. 19, but the number of federal employees applying for unemployment insurance jumped dramatically during that period. Federal civilian employees filed 25,419 initial jobless claims in the week ending Jan. 12, about 15,000 more than the previous week. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated this week that the 35-day partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, but projected that the U.S. economy will recoup all but $3 billion if the government remains open. Lawmakers face a Feb. 15 deadline to reach a spending agreement to keep the government open. While $3 billion is about 0.02 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, the shutdown put a financial strain on hundreds of thousands of federal workers who missed two consecutive paychecks. Those employees are slated to receive back pay, but many government contractors who lost income during the spending standoff are unlikely to be compensated. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the U.S. should rebound from the shutdown, but noted that the economy could take a long-term hit if another funding lapse causes “a loss of confidence in our ability to make policy in the United States.” View the discussion thread.

The poll, released Monday, found that 48 percent of respondents said they have no confidence “at all” in Trump, with another 16 percent saying they have “just some” confidence in the president. Slightly more than a third of respondents — 35 percent — said they have confidence in Trump, with 21 percent characterizing it as a “great deal” of confidence. The new poll shows the highest percentage to date of “none at all” responses to the question, which was also asked twice in 2017. Respondents did not have any more confidence in lawmakers in either party. Thirty percent of respondents said they have a “great deal” or “good amount” of confidence in the Republicans in Congress, and 34 percent said the same for Democrats. But the intensity of negative feelings toward both Democrats and Republicans in Congress was less than it was for Trump: Just 30 percent said they have no confidence “at all” in Republicans to make the right decisions for the nation, compared to 29 percent who said the same for Democrats. The poll also found that Trump has not met the public’s expectations on any of the policy issues raised in the poll. Respondents said Trump has underperformed compared to his ratings before the inauguration on a range of issues, with the most significant spread appearing on the budget deficit. Half of respondents in Jan. 2017 said they expected Trump to do an “excellent/good job” on the deficit, but just 33 percent in Monday’s poll said he has done so.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved A year after Trump won the election, it’s worth asking the question: Will democracy outlast Trump? Ronald Reagan once said that “freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.” He was right, and we, in the Trump era, are the generation that Reagan was unwittingly speaking about. Trump is precisely the kind of demagogue that the founders of America’s democratic republic worried about. They designed a system that anticipated someone like Trump. But his authoritarian instincts and impulses still pose a serious threat to the integrity of our democratic system of government. The danger, unfortunately, is real. Trump may not be a despot, but he is behaving like a despot’s apprentice — borrowing tactics from dictators and authoritarian strongmen across the globe. I’ve seen their tactics firsthand in my research, from sub-Saharan Africa to Southeast Asia to the Middle East to beyond the former Iron Curtain of post-Soviet Europe. I never thought I would see the same behavior from a United States president. Now we all see it. Trump scapegoats the press almost daily, echoing the language of Mao and Stalin in calling journalists “the enemy of the people,” while also threatening to revoke press licenses despite First Amendment protections. Mimicking Putin in Russia or Erdoğan in Turkey, Trump has politicized the rule of law, pardoning political allies while calling on the Department of Justice to “lock up” his political rival for things that aren’t crimes. Like autocrats throughout history, he tries to divide and rule, directing popular anger at unpopular minorities. And, like virtually every authoritarian leader, he attempts to tap into a “rally-around-the-flag” effect, portraying legitimate dissent against the government — like kneeling for the National Anthem — as hatred of America. In response, he has advocated for forced displays of patriotism — a hallmark of authoritarian leaders who seek to develop a cult of personality. Trump’s administration has also broken ethics guidelines routinely, wrapping himself up in absurdly compromising conflicts of interest. Drawing lessons from banana republics, he has surrounded himself with generals and unqualified family members, even putting his son’s wedding planner in charge of federal housing in New York and New Jersey. What’s more, he placed a climate change denier in charge of NASA. Even the integrity of our elections is under attack. Trump appointed a man with a record of voter suppression to head his bogus “election integrity commission.” The White House has effectively done nothing to deter future cyberattacks on American democracy. And for a system of government that relies on informed consent of the governed based on a shared set of facts, Trump lies routinely — more than any president in modern history. Thankfully, for now, the saving grace of American democracy seems to be Trump’s bumbling incompetence. His reckless, divisive tweets undercut his ability to build a governing coalition. His narcissistic impulsiveness takes a wrecking ball to his agenda. After nearly 300 days in office, he hasn’t signed any of the 10 major pieces of legislation he promised to sign in the first 100 days. It may be hard to see past those failures to understand how Trump is ushering in creeping authoritarianism even when he can’t even pass a health-care bill, but he is steadily eroding democracy in America. Trump doesn’t have to be effective in order to be destructive. The reason for this is simple: Trump has normalized authoritarian behavior while mainstreaming tactics that were previously considered out-of-bounds by both parties. Trump’s behavior once shocked us; now it’s routine. Many Republicans who used to swear by democratic principles have kowtowed to Trump while defending his violations of them. Crucially, tens of millions of American voters now accept and even expect authoritarian behavior from the president. They don’t just tolerate it; they cheer it. That transformation is going to be difficult to walk back. In most cases of democratic decay or rising authoritarianism, the crucial step is to change popular expectations and acclimate people to previously unacceptable behavior. This is one of the most insidious features of authoritarianism: It beats people into submission because you can’t fight 100 battles all at once. Citizens are forced to pick and choose. Authoritarian leaders are aware of this fact, and they exploit it to their own cynical ends. As normalization proceeds, the threat to American democracy grows. For political leaders and citizens alike, the change occurs so incrementally that it’s harder to stand up to it — particularly while Trump’s showmanship dazzles and distracts. Authoritarian abuses that would dominate weeks of news cycles in normal times seem like blips instead. A day later, it’s onto the next Trump outrage. Ultimately, the checks and balances created by the Founding Fathers to shield our democracy from a Trump-like figure are working as intended. The formal institutions of American democracy still stand strong, unbowed in the face of a bumbling demagogue. But the more realistic threat is a gradual but no less insidious one: that democracy in the United States will slowly but surely get hollowed out in informal ways. Millions will be seduced by Trump’s authoritarian populism, and most elected officials within his party either embrace that damaging shift, or tolerate it. Reagan warned us of this moment. We would be wise to heed his warning, put policy differences aside, and band together across party lines to defend democracy.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved One of the primary arguments from Republicans for repealing ObamaCare is that the healthcare law is “collapsing.” But experts warn that the GOP’s legislation might destabilize insurance markets even more over time. The Senate’s ObamaCare repeal-and-replace bill, released Thursday, would abolish ObamaCare’s mandate for people to have insurance, but it would still bar insurers from denying people coverage for pre-existing conditions. Experts warn that arrangement would allow people to wait until they get sick to buy insurance coverage, likely driving up premiums On top of that, the GOP bill cuts back on ObamaCare’s tax credits, providing less financial assistance to help people afford a plan. So in addition to the lack of an enforcement “stick” to get healthy people to enroll, there would also be less of a “carrot,” in the form of financial assistance. This combination could lead to more insurers pulling out of the market or hiking premiums, experts say, exactly the problems under ObamaCare that Republicans have talked about solving. “A combination of repealing the individual mandate and diminishing premium subsidies would tend to destabilize the market,” said Larry Levitt, a healthcare expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Rodney Whitlock, a former Republican congressional staffer who is now a healthcare consultant, wrote on Twitter that the lack of a mandate combined with lower financial assistance “is pretty much the definition of a death spiral.” However, sources say it is likely that an alternative to the individual mandate will be added to the bill next week before it is passed. That alternative is expected to be a provision requiring people to wait six months before signing up for insurance if they have a gap in coverage. Sources say the language is encountering problems under Senate rules governing the fast-track process being used, and Senate Republicans are working on ways to make the provision comply. Even if some mandate alternative were added, the legislation could lead to problems in the market. The legislation provides billions of dollars in a “stability fund” aimed at bringing down premiums for 2018 and 2019, which experts say is likely to make those years stable. But after those two years, the funding starts to taper off. Levitt said 2022 looks to be the first year where the market would face serious problems, due to reduced stability funding. The reduced financial assistance for people buying insurance is also an issue. With less help in affording a plan, people are likely to gravitate towards skimpier plans with lower premiums, but much higher deductibles. Consumers already face high deductibles under many ObamaCare plans, something Republicans have criticized. Experts say the GOP bill could make those deductibles worse. Healthy people might not want to buy a plan with a large deductible, and could just decide to stay out of the market instead. “Consumers might look at the benefit and say this is not good enough and I don't want to buy it,” said Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a consulting firm. In the short term, though, the Senate’s bill would likely make the next two years more stable, given that it provides a large amount of stability funding for those years. “In 2018 and 2019, they have done everything possible to establish stability,” Mendelson said. However, Mendelson said the stability funds might not be enough for 2020. That year is also the first time the reduced tax credit kicks in. Before that, the bill maintains the current level of ObamaCare tax credits. That change could make 2020, an election year, a problem in terms of rising premiums or insurers dropping out, he said. Mendelson said he did not understand “why the president would be interested in legislation where the funding dries out in the year he's running for reelection.” View the discussion thread.

He suggested that Rosenstein \"should order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation.\" Whitaker also raised the possibility that a replacement for Sessions could reduce Mueller's funding to the point that the investigation came to \"almost a halt.\" “I could see a scenario where Jeff SessionsJefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsOvernight Energy & Environment — Democrats detail clean electricity program Whatever else he did, Cuomo did not obstruct justice by ranting to Obama White House Want to evaluate Donald Trump's judgment?

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved A new poll finds the public views the looming “fiscal cliff” as a serious crisis for the nation and would blame Republicans more than President Obama if Washington fails to reach a deal. Forty-five percent surveyed in a new CNN/ORC poll said they would blame congressional Republicans if there is no agreement, with 34 percent pointing the finger at Obama. Two-thirds say the U.S. would experience serious problems if the combination of tax rate increases and automatic spending cuts expected in January take effect. One in four says the country would experience a crisis, with 44 percent expecting major problems if a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff is not found. One in four says the fiscal cliff would cause minor problems, with 7 percent saying there would not be any consequences. Seventy-seven percent of Americans believe their personal situation would be affected if the U.S. fell over the cliff. Democrats are insisting that any deal include raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. Republicans are opposed to raising tax rates, but more GOP lawmakers have signaled support for new revenues through closing loopholes and eliminating deductions. Republicans, though, insist that such measures be met by Democrats placing entitlement reform on the negotiating table. Lawmakers will return to Washington this week to begin talks on reaching a deficit-reduction package, with top lawmakers from both parties signaling a willingness to put more solutions on the negotiating table. Seven in 10 Americans want lawmakers and the White House to compromise and reach an agreement, but two-thirds say they believe efforts will fall short. Twenty-eight percent say they expect Washington to behave like “responsible adults,” with 67 percent saying leaders will behave like “spoiled children.” By a 52-44 split, Republicans surveyed in the poll said they favor a combination of spending cuts and tax increases over only spending cuts. Democrats surveyed overwhelmingly support both elements in a deal, with six of 10 independents wanting both cuts and tax increases. Fifty-six percent say taxes on the wealthy should be high, while 36 percent support low rates to help boost investment and job growth. The CNN poll was conducted from Nov. 16-18 and has a 3-point margin of error. View the discussion thread.

All Rights Reserved Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonHoward Stern rips vaccine opponents: 'F--- their freedom, I want my freedom to live' New Hampshire Democrat wins GOP-held state House seat Clinton thrilled to have Joan Allen recording her new book MORE is ready to run on President ObamaBarack Hussein ObamaScott Brown's wife files to run for Congress Why a slower start can benefit a new president Biden to stump for Newsom on Monday during western swing MORE’s record when it comes to the economy. Clinton allies say that if the former secretary of State does in fact announce a second bid for the presidency this year, they expect that she’ll tether herself to a main slice of Obama’s legacy. A series of economic reports including Friday’s positive jobs numbers is adding to Democratic confidence that the economy will finally be a winner for Obama in his last two years in office, and that it will help the Democratic White House candidate in 2016. But even as Clinton embraces Obama’s economic record, they expect her to telegraph that more needs to be done to help the middle class, a message Obama will highlight in his State of the Union address later this month. They also predict that Clinton will present policies distinct from those of the Obama administration she served, and even her own husband’s administration, which is regularly credited with presiding over years of strong economic growth. This tack, allies say, will allow her to to carve out her own identity and provide her with the opportunity to speak about education, making housing more affordable and helping younger Americans find jobs and build her own narrative. “She'll be running armed with the current information and with programs and plans and polices that she wants to support,” said Ellen Tauscher, the former congresswoman who serves as undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs at the State Department under Clinton. Democratic strategist Jim Manley said that he expects Clinton to “keep pretty close to the administration’s basic economic policies. But, he added, “I wouldn’t be surprised if she found ways to exploit the growing debate on economic equality.” One longtime Clinton ally agrees with that sentiment. This source said Clinton would argue for “a Main Street platform that combines certain kinds of tax reform, trade agreements and investment strategies, perhaps fashioned around overarching goals.” “This is an approach that a Republican candidate could choose to take too; what will matter is who does it best,” the ally said. Republicans—from the RNC to the superPAC America Rising-- are already working to portray Clinton as a third term for Obama. “She has no choice but to own the Obama economic agenda because she has been in lock-step with him on it ever since 2008,” Tim Miller, the executive director for America Rising, said Friday. Miller said healthcare will fall under Obama’s economic package and Clinton has no choice but to own that piece as well. The bookHRC State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton, revealed that the secretary of state played a role in pushing along Obamacare. She voiced her support for it in a cabinet meeting and spoke to lawmakers about the issue, even though Secretaries of State rarely get involved in domestic matters. “He took her healthcare plan and then she whipped votes for it,” Miller said. “There is no path for her to distance herself from him on it.” Clinton allies say they are aware that Republicans will do everything to tie her to Obama's policies. But as Tauscher cautioned, Republicans have to be careful invoking that Clinton could be a third term Obama because Democrats could very easily say that Jeb Bush or other Republican candidates could be a third term for George W. Bush, who was president during the economic meltdown. The Democratic National Committee was quick to strike back at Jeb Bush’s intentions to run for president on Friday, putting out a release accusing the Bush team of being “the same people who not once but twice were at the helm as our nation headed into recessions, one of which was our worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.” The plan to embrace Obama’s economic record differs from Clinton’s approach to Obama on foreign policy. Even though she serves as Obama’s secretary of state, she has made a point of highlighting her differing views and strategies on Syria. In an interview with The Atlantic, she said that the administration’s decision not to get involved in the Syrian conflict was a “failure.” People in Clintonworld have also signaled recently that she would have taken a different approach to ISIS. “You never want to be a Monday morning quarterback on these issues because who knows how things would ultimately turn out but Obama has been passive on these issues,” one former Clinton aide told The Hill in September. “She would have taken a more aggressive approach.” When it comes to the economy though, Clinton could face a different set of challenges in a Democratic primary. Progressives have bashed her support of Wall Street and have insinuated that she cares more about protecting the well-heeled over the middle class. But Tauscher pushed back at that notion calling that debate “distracting.” “The question should be how do we get a Main Street thriving and doing well and how do we get a responsible Wall Street that is stimulating jobs,” she said. “It’s not an either or.” View the discussion thread.

Four people who regularly speak with the 77-year-old Biden told Politico that it is unlikely he would run for reelection in 2024, when he would be in his 80s. “If Biden is elected,” an adviser to the campaign told the news outlet, “he’s going to be 82 years old in four years and he won’t be running for reelection.” “He’s going into this thinking, ‘I want to find a running mate I can turn things over to after four years, but if that’s not possible or doesn’t happen then I’ll run for reelection.’ But he’s not going to publicly make a one-term pledge,” another adviser reportedly said. Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager and communications director, declined Politico's request for comment but later tweeted \"this is not a conversation our campaign is having and not something VP Biden is thinking about.\" Lots of chatter out there on this so just want to be crystal clear: this is not a conversation our campaign is having and not something VP Biden is thinking about.  The Associated Press reported that Biden said in October that he wouldn't promise to serve just one term but that he wasn't necessarily committed to running for another four years. “I feel good and all I can say is, watch me, you’ll see,” he told the AP at the time. “It doesn’t mean I would run a second term. I’m not going to make that judgment at this moment.” Biden has been a front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, and polling aggregation website RealClearPolitics has him in first place nationally, although his support is weaker in some early voting states. -Updated 11:06 a.m. View the discussion thread.

The armed protests began Saturday night at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. The protesters say they are acting in response to unfair prison sentences for a pair of ranchers convicted of arson on federal land. The federation said the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, home to over 320 species of birds, follows multiple unsuccessful state-level and congressional efforts to privatize public lands, which are now accessible to all Americans.

HOUSE VOTES TO EXPAND PLANNED PARENTHOOD PROBE: The House voted Wednesday to create a special committee to investigate Planned Parenthood and the handling of aborted fetal tissue, all but ensuring an already-fierce partisan battle will continue into 2016. In a nearly party-line vote, lawmakers voted 242 to 184 to establish a 13-member committee with broad power to investigate wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood amid allegations that it has tried to profit from the sale of aborted tissue. The four-page bill does not mention Planned Parenthood by name. Instead, it charges the committee to investigate \"fetal tissue procurement,\" \"federal funding and support for abortion providers\" and \"born-alive\" abortions, generally. But Republicans were clear that the committee's work is intended to expand three existing House committee probes into Planned Parenthood, which began in early August. The committees have held three hearings as part of their investigations, which has prompted Planned Parenthood to turn over at least 20,000 documents, according to Democrats. Read more here.

The survey found a 5 percentage point increase in Trump's disapproval from last month. The only time his disapproval rating was higher, according to Fox News, was when it reached 57 percent in October 2017. Forty-three percent of respondents said they approve of Trump's job performance, down from 46 percent last month.

Researchers surveyed 1,013 registered voters nationwide from Aug. 11 to 13. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The poll comes at a tense political moment following two mass shootings earlier this month, one of which appears to have been racially motivated. Approval for Trump's response to the incidents is just 37 percent, and 46 percent said they believe his administration has made the country less safe from mass shootings. Fifty-nine percent of voters in the poll say they are unhappy with the way things are going in the country. The same proportion say the president is \"tearing the country apart,\" compared to only 31 percent who say he is \"drawing the country together.\" Two years ago, those numbers stood at 56 percent and 33 percent, respectively.

Debbie Wasserman SchultzDeborah (Debbie) Wasserman SchultzDNC members grow frustrated over increasing White House influence Lobbying world Biden: Families of victims of Surfside building collapse 'realistic' about rescue MORE has a tough fall ahead. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) chief is under fire from some of the top Democratic presidential hopefuls over her handling of the primary debates, and she's facing a huge decision over whether to support President Obama's historic nuclear deal with Iran.Those issues highlight the difficulties facing the six-term Florida Democrat as she juggles her responsibilities to the president she supports, the constituents she represents and the broader party she's leading into the high-stakes 2016 elections.Wasserman Schultz's primary role as DNC head is to devise a campaign message that unifies the Democrats and distinguishes their priorities from those of the Republicans in the eyes of voters. But both the debate controversy and the Iran vote have distracted from that objective, threatening to undermine the show of Democratic unity even as party leaders are calling attention to the deep divisions in the GOP.The DNC stirred a hornet's nest in May when it announced a six-debate schedule through the primary season — roughly a quarter of the 2008 total and half the number available to the Republican candidates this cycle.The Democratic underdogs — notably Sen. Bernie SandersBernie SandersDavid Sirota: Pharmaceuticals will try to make Medicare proposal as limited as possible Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Democrats face headwinds on .5 trillion plan, debt ceiling MORE (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley — wasted no time hammering the schedule as insufficient. The contenders want more opportunities to face off with front-runner Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonHoward Stern rips vaccine opponents: 'F--- their freedom, I want my freedom to live' New Hampshire Democrat wins GOP-held state House seat Clinton thrilled to have Joan Allen recording her new book MORE, and their criticisms have only escalated this month after the DNC released more details surrounding the debates.Sanders on Sunday accused the DNC of being \"dead wrong\" in its debate strategy, while O'Malley charged the leaders of his own party with pushing a “rigged process” designed to advantage Clinton.“I think it’s a big mistake for us as a party to circle the wagons around the inevitable front-runner,” O’Malley said last week.Wasserman Schultz's office did not respond to requests for comment this week, but the DNC chairwoman has defended the debate schedule, saying the six events will both lend voters \"ample opportunity to hear from our candidates about their vision for our country’s future\" and \"highlight the clear contrast between the values of the Democratic Party which is focused on strengthening the middle class versus Republicans.\"Some former DNC officials agree. David Mercer, the DNC's deputy national finance director during the Clinton presidency, said the six debates present both \"a level playing field\" and \"an amazing opportunity\" for the Democratic candidates to make their case to voters.Mercer, who worked under nine DNC heads between 1989 and 1997, said the criticism \"has more to do with candidates seeking short term media and news coverage and visibility than anything to do with what we know to be a fair, balanced debate schedule that will command a diverse and national audience of millions.\" \"In the end, it's one's performance in debates, not complaint about them, that will attract voter attention and, hopefully as a result, voter support,\" added Mercer, now president of Mercer & Associates, a strategic consulting firm. But such arguments have done little to satisfy the Democratic critics. Indeed, O'Malley announced Wednesday that he's urging supporters to join a protest outside DNC headquarters on Sept. 16. \"It's time to take it up a notch,\" reads a release from O'Malley's campaign office.The Iran vote, for Wasserman Schultz, is no less troublesome.The Florida Democrat represents a significant Jewish population — more than 15 percent, according to numbers compiled by the Jewish Federations of America — and she's been a fierce defender of Israel and its chief lobbying group in Washington, which opposes the nuclear accord. Recent polls show Florida voters also strongly oppose the deal, and several Florida Democrats have already said they'll vote against it when the Republicans bring a disapproval measure to the floor this month.But the administration has been pressing hard on Democrats to support the agreement; the top Democrats on Capitol Hill — including Senate Minority Leader Harry ReidHarry Mason ReidHarry Reid renews call for filibuster to be abolished: 'We need to get the Senate working again' White House says ball is in Congress's court on voting rights, abortion Biden grapples with twin crises MORE (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy PelosiNancy PelosiMerriam-Webster's partisanship is showing – again – with its latest definition GOP leader taking proxy voting fight to Supreme Court Majority in new poll backs Manchin 'pause' on .5T spending plan MORE (D-Calif.) — are rallying behind it; and the leading Democratic presidential contenders — including Clinton, Sanders and O'Malley — have all endorsed it, as well.An opposition vote by the DNC head would not only diminish that unity, it would also lend political ammunition to Republicans, who are near-unanimous in their opposition to the nuclear deal.Adding to the pressure on Wasserman Schultz, Vice President Biden is scheduled to meet with Jewish leaders Thursday in her district to pitch the agreement. The dynamics have left Wasserman Schultz with a tough choice: Reject the deal opposed by most Floridians and risk highlighting Democratic divisions on Obama's top foreign policy issue, or support the agreement for the sake of party unity and risk alienating her constituents.William Galston, a former adviser to President Clinton, said those frictions come with the territory when lawmakers accept positions of national leadership.\"By accepting that role, she has, in a way, bound herself to consider interests broader than herself and the constituents she represents,\" said Galston, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"It's not simply pressure from the party, it's a responsibility she has to the party in her leadership position.\"You're not a free agent the way you might have been before.\"Julian E. Zelizer, political scientist at Princeton University, agreed, saying it's \"not uncommon for there to be tensions between party needs and constituent needs.\"He noted that many Democrats who backed President Clinton's proposed tax increases in 1993 suffered politically at home, and the same was true for a good number of lawmakers who backed Obama's healthcare reform law in 2010.\"Balancing these needs is one of the toughest jobs for a legislative leader. There is no clear path forward,\" Zelizer said. \"Obviously the biggest danger is alienating your constituents so much that they vote you out of office. \"You can heal wounds among party leaders,\" he added, \"but sometimes constituents can be unforgiving.\" View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Welcome to The Hill's Morning Report, which is replacing The Hill's morning Tipsheet each weekday. This comprehensive morning email, reported by Jonathan Easley and Alexis Simendinger, briefs you on the most important developments in politics and what to look for in the days and weeks ahead… The Hill’s annual 50 Most Beautiful list has been retired after nearly 15 years. A beautiful idea, whose time is up. \"It's been a great run, but all things must come to an end,” editor-in-chief Bob Cusack says. *** The White House has another drama on its hands, this time raising questions about how long U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki HaleyNikki HaleyTrump schedules rallies in Iowa, Georgia Miami mayor on possible White House bid: I think people are 'thirsting' for a 'next-generation candidate' Bill Clinton fundraises for Terry McAuliffe in upstate New York MORE will remain in President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE’s administration. The dust-up was pointed and public. Haley is a star on the right and until this weekend appeared to work effortlessly with the White House, taking on a larger role than her position would warrant in the absence of a secretary of State. That’s changed. The White House undercut Haley after she asserted during a television appearance that the administration was poised to impose new economic sanctions on Russia. No sanctions emerged, and Trump’s team labored to explain the confusion. National economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Tuesday that Haley “got ahead of the curve” and that “there might have been some momentary confusion about that.” Haley wasted no words in her written reply: “With all due respect, I don’t get confused.” Kudlow later said he was wrong to imply that Haley was confused (and apologized to the ambassador), but the mix-up over sanctions followed separate friction with Trump and the White House over a Haley aide Vice President Pence tapped to be his adviser. The president questioned the choice — the aide had been critical of Trump — and the hiring was reversed. We’re hearing that some in Trump’s orbit are frustrated with Haley because they perceive her to be maneuvering around Trump politically and getting ahead of him on policy. To Trump’s allies, the hiring controversy looked like a strategic alliance between Pence and Haley, and a challenge to the president. Some of Trump’s backers wondered if the pair was privately plotting a Pence-Haley ticket, should Trump not seek reelection. That kind of speculation can lead to shortened service in Trump’s world. The Hill’s Jordan Fabian has more reporting on this here. Rift between Haley and White House erupts over sanctions. (The New York Times) LEADING THE DAY Former first lady Barbara Bush, 92, the wife of the 41st president and mother of the 43rd, died Tuesday after a period of failing health. (The New York Times) U.S and North Korea in `direct talks’ via Pompeo secret meeting: The two countries held “direct talks at very high levels,” Trump revealed Tuesday. CIA Director Mike PompeoMike PompeoPompeo endorses Kansas AG Schmidt in gubernatorial race Trump schedules rallies in Iowa, Georgia Biden and Blinken must end diplomatic failures MORE secretly met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at Trump’s direction over Easter weekend, The Washington Post reported. The administration has been dealing with North Korean representatives through a channel that runs between the CIA. and its North Korean counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, according to the New York Times. Trump tweeted that the meeting went \"very smoothly and a great relationship was formed.\" A proposed U.S.-North Korea summit could take place in early June, or not at all, Trump told reporters while hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Florida. Five possible summit locations are under discussion, none in the United States. The president hopes a future face-to-face meeting can persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Abe is seeking assurances from the president that Japan will be protected in any nuclear pact that might emerge. The prime minister and Trump continue meeting today to discuss trade issues and Japan’s purchases of U.S. military equipment. Also, “we’re going to sneak out ... and play a round of golf if possible,” Trump added. International addendum: ➔Trump tweets of 'revolution' in California over sanctuary law. ➔ Hannity and Trump shared more than one legal adviser. If it were a novel, reviewers would reject the plot. A former adult-film actress, who says she had an affair with the president, wants the courts to release her from an agreement not to talk about it. To publicize her version of events, Stormy Daniels releases an artist’s sketch of a man she says threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot seven years ago, asking the public to help find him. And the president weighed in this morning on Twitter, referencing the sketch: Separately, The Atlantic reports Trump and Sean Hannity are tied through additional attorney connections aside from Michael CohenMichael Dean CohenAndrew Cuomo and the death of shame Prosecutors considered charging Trump Organization CFO with perjury: report Michael Wolff and the art of monetizing gossip MORE — Jay Sekulow, the president’s personal attorney in the Russia investigation, and Victoria Toensing, wife of attorney Joe diGenova, a frequent guest on Hannity’s show. Trump recently considered hiring the couple to represent his legal interests, but the president’s team decided the pair had legal “conflicts.” Fox News, via a statement, said it supports Hannity in the wake of the disclosure that Cohen claimed Hannity as a legal client, disputed by the anchor. Next up: The government will begin the process of providing seized materials to Cohen’s team. This could take more than a week to process. Cohen’s lawyers will work with Trump’s lawyers to provide access to all the material relevant to the president for review. The Hill: Cohen’s negative headlines complicate Trump’s political life. IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES ➔ Gorsuch sides with liberals on immigration case: Ask Republicans about Trump’s greatest achievement and many will point to reliable conservative Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch. So it was a surprise on Tuesday when he joined the liberals in a 5-4 decision stating that a federal law that eases the deportation of immigrants convicted of crimes is unenforceable because it’s too vague. The ruling frustrated Trump and his Justice Department; the administration quickly said Congress must move to fix the law. Influential conservative news aggregator Matt Drudge warned: Gorsuch sides with libs, hands Trump loss on immigration. But don’t expect conservatives to sour on Gorsuch just yet. ➔ Mark Krikorian, the executive director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for stricter immigration policies, tells us in an email: “It doesn't bother me much. It was a question of statutory interpretation and while I'd have preferred that he'd side with the other conservatives on the court (and the Obama administration), it's a little early to start jumping to conclusions.” The bottom line: The Judicial branch will not settle decades-long immigration debates. Congress will have to act with a willing president and election politics that shift the narratives -- an unlikely proposition in 2018. More on immigration: Two groups affiliated with the billionaire conservative donors Charles and David Koch have launched a seven-figure national campaign to pressure Congress to act to protect so-called Dreamers — immigrants who came to the country illegally as minors. That’s unlikely to happen in an election year, and the Koch network, which has pledged to spend up to $400 million ahead of the midterm election, has expressed frustration that the GOP-controlled Congress is running out the clock.

Republicans are banking on the public’s embrace of tax cuts to save the GOP majority in the House. Bad news on that front — a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that only 27 percent of the public thinks the law is a good idea, down from 30 percent in January. Thirty-six percent say it’s a bad idea. Republicans are also cheerleading about the economy, but have a few mixed messages on that front. Kudlow, a deficit hawk, attacked the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ green eyeshades, saying the scorekeepers should never be trusted. The CBO has projected massive deficits well into the future. But the Republican chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, Rep. Erik PaulsenErik Philip PaulsenThe Biden 15 percent global tax puts foreign companies ahead of American workers House panel opens probe into Tom Reed over sexual misconduct allegations GOP Rep.

The Hill: Republicans are divided about bringing another tax bill to the floor because of deficit concerns. And Democrats say, “let’s see,” Reuters reports. ➔ Cabinet watch: Senate Republicans are pushing forward with a trio of Trump’s Cabinet picks, setting up high-stakes confirmation battles. Pompeo as secretary of State could see a committee vote next week. The White House on Tuesday sent the formal nomination of Gina Haspel to lead the CIA to the Senate. Also awaiting confirmation is Ronny Jackson to be secretary of Veterans Affairs (The Hill).

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — White nationalist Richard Spencer arrived at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Thursday, appearing to be a sign of the “alt-right” movement’s attempts to fit in with conservatives. And then he got kicked out. Escorted from the event by security, Spencer was left to talk to reporters outside while the conservatives continued their annual convention without him. Spencer’s abrupt exit was just one way conservatives tried to grapple with the rise of the alt-right movement Thursday at CPAC, offering differing interpretations about who falls into that category and even what the term means. Both conservatives and the alt-right have challenged the Republican Party establishment. But conservatives emphasized that they shouldn’t be equated with the so-called alternative right, or alt-right, an umbrella term for the nebulous white nationalist movement that has been accused of bigotry. On Thursday, CPAC kicked off its first full day with a speech titled “The Alt Right Ain’t Right at All.” The conference also featured White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, later in the day. As recently as last summer, Bannon called Breitbart “the platform for the alt-right.” A board member of the American Conservative Union (ACU), which organizes CPAC, says it’s “always” an issue of who should be included in the speaker lineup, but argued that their ultimate goal is to make the conservative movement “as broad a coalition as you can possibly have.” “If you’re going to have a big tent, there are going to be people in there who don’t necessarily agree, and maybe disagree, on a lot of issues,” that board member told The Hill on the condition of anonymity. Spencer had been talking to reporters for more than 30 minutes when security escorted him out, according to several reports, because his views did not match those of CPAC. The ejection of Spencer, who had paid at least $150 for a CPAC ticket, comes on the heels of the conservative gathering rescinding its invitation to alt-right provocateur and former Breitbart senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos after videos resurfaced showing him appearing to defend pedophilia. Aiming to be more inclusive with its lineup, CPAC drew heavy criticism from liberals and conservatives alike over Yiannopoulos’s prominent keynote speaking slot. Following the outcry over the video, ACU Chairman Matt Schlapp called his comments “disturbing.” Yiannopoulos has since resigned from Breitbart amid the controversy. Spencer's swift removal brought more attention to a presentation by a member of the ACU leadership Thursday morning that targeted the alt-right. During the event's first speech, ACU Executive Director Dan Schneider sought to place the alt-right outside the bounds of acceptable GOP politics. “There is a sinister organization that is trying to worm its way into our ranks, and we must not be duped, we must not be deceived. This is serious business,” Schneider said, not long before Spencer was kicked out. The term “alt-right” has been “hijacked” by a “hate-filled, left-wing fascist group” — the same one, he says, that descended with Spencer upon Washington last year and caused a stir with nationalist rhetoric and Nazi salutes. “This group has hijacked it, hijacked the term, and they did it intentionally to try because they want to deceive the media and deceive you all about what they stand for so that they can try to become normalized,” he added. “We must not let them to be normalized; they are not part of us.” Despite Schneider’s comments, there’s debate over whether “alt-right” was ever an innocuous term — and how much white nationalists could “hijack” the term when Spencer himself is regularly credited as its originator. Shortly after Schneider’s speech, Spencer excoriated the ACU executive for name-calling and not being fully informed about the alt-right movement. “Dan Schneider has a small and closed mind,” Spencer told a group of reporters huddled outside the main event. “He didn’t even do basic research on what the alt-right is and he denounced it. That’s pretty pathetic.” Spencer noted that he felt welcomed at the conservative gathering. “They’re not punching me, are they?” he laughed, referring to an incident on the day of President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE’s inauguration, where he was punched on the streets of Washington, D.C., captured in a video that went viral. A CPAC spokesman called Spencer “repugnant,” according to an NBC News reporter. On Twitter, Breitbart London Editor-in-Chief Raheem Kassam said he had expressed “a concern” about Spencer’s presence before he was removed. But the conference welcomed one frequent critic of traditional conservatism and of CPAC itself: Bannon. It’s not unusual for a White House official to appear at CPAC. But Bannon’s appearance, which saw him expound on his ideas of “economic nationalism” that are often at odds with free-trade conservatism, was a sign of CPAC’s attempts to adapt to the Trump era. Bannon spoke at a panel with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus to discuss the administration and their working relationship. Bannon was quick to acknowledge his past absence from CPAC and thanked Schlapp for “finally” inviting him to speak, prompting laughter from all three. The controversial former head of Breitbart News did his own counter-programming, “The Uninvited,” in 2013 for speakers who weren’t include in CPAC’s lineup. Bannon noted that there were “many alumni in the audience” at Thursday’s panel. But this year, conservative leaders are going out of their way to paint Bannon in a positive light and demonstrate that the conservative movement is seeking to be more inclusive. Bannon did his part, making no mention of the “alt-right” he once allied himself with through Breitbart. “Here’s what we decided to do at CPAC with ‘The Uninvited’ at CPAC,” Schlapp said. “We decided to say that everybody is part of our conservative family. And that’s what Donald Trump has done to so many of us around the country politically.” While Schneider’s own speech condemned the alt-right, Schneider defended Bannon’s character and noted Breitbart’s religiously diverse staff. “He does not have a bone of hate in his body,” Schneider told reporters at CPAC. While conservatives’ perception of Bannon has morphed since he signed on to Trump’s campaign and became a prominent fixture in the White House, organizers within CPAC argue that it’s important to make the distinction between the alt-right and who Bannon is today. “I know Dan [Schneider] speaks for a large number of people here at CPAC, and I think there’s going to be some tension between those folks, but I don’t know how much of Steve Bannon is tied to the alt-right today,” the CPAC director said.

Lois FrankelLois Jane FrankelDemocrats repeal prohibition on funding abortions abroad Investing in child care paves the way to a better economy Democrats introduce equal pay legislation for US national team athletes MORE (D-Fla.) called on Trump to either provide federal reimbursements to the local governments incurring increased security costs or cut back his trips to the resort. “While we want the fullest protection for your visits, we hope you would be responsive to the losses of small businesses and residents of Palm Beach County,” Frankel wrote in a letter to Trump released on Monday, which was co-signed by fellow Democratic Florida Reps. Alcee Hastings and Ted Deutch. “If compensation is not assured of being forthcoming, we respectfully ask that you curtail your visits until such time as that matter is resolved favorably to our area.” The lawmakers outlined the piling costs of Trump’s visits to Mar-a-Lago to date: $1.7 million in overtime work paid by the the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Department and Fire Rescue and $60,000 in overtime to the City of West Palm Beach law enforcement handling protests. Trump’s hosting of Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago next month is expected to cost the sheriff and fire departments $280,000 alone, according to the letter. The Florida lawmakers also noted that flights are not allowed to take off at a local airport while Trump is at Mar-a-Lago, due to Secret Service restrictions. The company that manages the airport loses about $30,000 during each of Trump’s weekend visits and lost a $440,000 annual contract with a helicopter company that moved to another airport due to the security measure. Flight schools, banner flying and sightseeing businesses have also been impacted as a result, the lawmakers added. “While we want the fullest protection for your visits, we hope that you would be responsive to the losses of small businesses and residents of Palm Beach County,” they wrote. Trump has multiple times traveled to his family-owned businesses both during his presidential transition and since assuming office. He stayed in the Washington area this past weekend, spending parts of Saturday and Sunday at one of his golf clubs in Sterling, Va. He later ate dinner at the Trump International Hotel in Washington Saturday evening. View the discussion thread.

If he’s successful in his first two years and is popular enough to create comfortable Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress after the midterm elections, he could and should move to more ambitious goals. But the prospects for a positive working relationship between the president-elect and congressional Republicans are bleak. A big block of Republicans don’t accept the legitimacy of his presidency. Several GOP senators and more than one 100 House Republicans have announced their opposition to certifying Biden’s victory in the Electoral College. The widespread opposition of GOP senators to the certification of Biden’s Electoral College majority on Wednesday is a clear sign of the resistance that the 46th president will face. Republican Sens.

Congressional Republicans ignored concerns about the massive increase in the federal budget deficit throughout most of Trump’s tenure. But during the debate over the pandemic stimulus payment, the GOP based its opposition to the $2,000 payment on their newfound interest in reining in the deficit. This bodes poorly for any attempt by the new president to increase federal spending to counter the ravages of the pandemic and the economic downturn.

Despite the obstacles, there is a path to success for him. But it will require patience that is in short supply in the political arena. Biden believes fighting COVID-19 is his priority, and his success in battling the pandemic is a necessary condition for making progress on everything else. His executive authority as president will give him the leeway to fight the pandemic more aggressively and distribute the vaccine more speedily than the Trump administration did. If Biden can end the pandemic, he might accumulate enough political capital and power in Congress to move mountains after the midterm elections in 2022. With his power to issue executive orders, Biden should act quickly to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and reverse the Trump orders that limited the power of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to fight climate change. The new president should also act to increase the eligibility of working families for help under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and to reduce the student loan debts that burden the economy. Biden can also use his bully pulpit as president after four years of Trump tweets. If he plays his cards right early, he will have enough momentum to be more aggressive in the second half of his term. If Biden is successful in his fight against the pandemic and that leads to an improvement in the economy and big Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, the major challenge in the second half of his term will be the health care crisis. The pandemic has exposed the crushing reality of the health care in this country and that will force Biden to face the problem. A big Democratic win in the midterm elections will put a lot of pressure from progressives on the president to fight for Medicare for All, which he opposed during his campaign for president. But even if Biden opts to simply supersize Obamacare, he could pave the way Medicare for All in the future by bringing a larger proportion of Americans under the federal government’s health care umbrella. He could do this by making more Americans eligible for Medicaid and by making Americans eligible for Medicare at the age of 55 instead of waiting for their 65th birthday. Biden must be successful in his first two years to create a path for a big and bold push during the second half of his term. To do this, he must not only fight the Trump Republicans, but he will need to reverse political history. Typically, presidents accomplish more early rather than late in their terms, and usually chief executives lose power in Congress instead of gaining seats for their party in the midterm elections. The success of his presidency rests on the premise that he can reverse the trend. Nothing will come easily for the 46th president.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved President Obama’s plan to allow 10,000 new Syrian refugees into the U.S. is facing fresh criticism after Friday evening’s terror attacks across Paris, which were carried out by least one person who had reportedly slipped into France among the migrants. The White House is insisting that nothing had changed, and that the United States is fully capable of vetting the refugees. Yet top lawmakers and GOP presidential candidates made clear on Sunday that they don’t have the same confidence in U.S. intelligence, due to the lingering blind spots caused by the chaos in Syria. According to reports, at least one of the men behind the Paris attack, which killed 129 people in a string of coordinated violence, made his way into the country by hiding himself among refugees. \"We won’t be able to take more refugees,” Sen. Marco RubioMarco Antonio RubioOvernight Hillicon Valley — Hacking goes global Rubio knocks CIA over consideration of TikTok presence Overnight Hillicon Valley — Pro-Chinese group tries to mobilize US protests MORE (R-Fla.) bluntly declared on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\" “It’s not that we don’t want to — it’s that we can’t. Because there’s no way to background check someone that’s coming from Syria.” “You can’t pick up the phone and call Syria,” added Rubio, whose presidential campaign has been on the upswing in recent days. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) echoed the concern about the U.S. officials’ inability to peer deeply into the past of the thousands of refugees on course to enter the country. “We are losing the capability to track these terrorists around the globe,” he claimed on CBS’s Face the Nation.” “There's no possible way to screen them. It should be stopped immediately.” Earlier this year, in the face of global outrage about the humanitarian crisis in Syria and the millions of desperate refugees fleeing the country’s borders, the Obama administration announced that it would increase the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. next year to 10,000. That’s a dramatic increase from the roughly 2,000 refugees that have so far been admitted into the country, but still relatively minor compared to policies of some countries in Europe and the Middle East. Of the more than 4 million Syrian refugees, 2 million have fled to Turkey. Germany expects to take in 800,000 this year. On Sunday, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes insisted that the administration’s plans remain on course. “We’re still planning on taking in Syrian refugees,” Rhodes said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We had very robust vetting procedures for those refugees.” “There are women and children, orphans of this war, and I think we need to do our part along with our allies to provide them a safe haven.” It’s clear, however, that the plan will face new opposition from Congress in light of Friday night’s carnage. Top Republican lawmakers had long been concerned about the ability of Islamic extremists to slip in among the refugees’ ranks, and they appear primed to fight back in light of the Paris killings. “We don’t want to be complicit with a program that could bring potential terrorists into the United States,” insisted House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas). President Obama is “rolling the dice” with this refugee plan, added Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. The debate appears primed to spread to the campaign trail, as multiple top Republicans claimed that Obama’s plan was yet further evidence of what they call his underestimation of ISIS's strength. “Bringing people into this country from that area of the world I think is a huge mistake, because why wouldn’t they infiltrate them with people who are ideologically opposed to us?” GOP candidate and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson said on “Fox News Sunday.” The White House has insisted that refugees will be fully vetted, both by the U.S. as well as international officials. However, the claim has gotten some pushback from members of the president’s own administration. Earlier this year, FBI Director James Comey warned a Senate panel that intelligence officials had “gaps” in their ability to screen the refugees, due to the lack of reliable information coming out of Syria. “There is no such thing as a no-risk enterprise and there are deficits that we face,” Comey testified in October. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) declined to specifically address the refugee issue during a pair of Sunday show appearances. Instead, he focused his remarks on the ongoing chaos in Syria, which a global effort has so far failed to halt. “I think we need to do thorough screening and take a limited number, but ultimately the best way to deal with the refugee crisis is to create safe zones inside of Syria,” the GOP presidential candidate said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The great majority of refugees need to be safely kept in Syria,” he said later, on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Which means the safe zones need to be serious.” In the wake of Friday evening’s attack, multiple analysts have also wondered whether France will turn to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on country is an attack on all. Multiple Republicans on Sunday urged the French to consider invoking that measure, as a means to ramp up the international effort against ISIS. “Hopefully President [Francois] Hollande will call Article 5 of NATO in and maybe we'll put together a coalition that can for once attack this horrific terrorist element before they have ability to carry out another coordinated attack like this,” said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard BurrRichard Mauze BurrNC Republican primary key test of Trump's sway The 19 GOP senators who voted for the T infrastructure bill Senate votes to end debate on T infrastructure bill MORE (R-N.C.). If Paris decides to invoke Article 5, Rhodes on Sunday indicated that the U.S. would be willing to support it. “That’s a decision for the French to make,” the White House aide said on “Meet the Press.” “What we've made clear to the French is we will be shoulder to shoulder with them in this response.” View the discussion thread.

Trump's preferred candidate in a special House election in Texas lost on Tuesday to another Republican who was likely boosted by some protest votes against the former president. And on Wednesday, 17 Senate Republicans voted to advance a bipartisan infrastructure deal that Trump spent weeks railing against. While Trump remains a towering figure in the GOP, the back-to-back blows have led some to question whether his influence may have started to wane since he left office.ADVERTISEMENT “Trump has not had a big win in quite a while,” Alex Conant, a Republican strategist, said. “I think without wins, his political capital is depleted.” “Donald Trump does not have a post-presidential strategy,” he added. “He is overexposed at the same time that he’s not getting enough attention. He’s giving lots of speeches and traveling the country, but other than his narrow base no one’s really paying attention and I think that limits his influence.” Trump received a blow to his endorsing power this week when Susan Wright, his candidate of choice in a runoff election for Texas’s 6th Congressional District, lost to fellow Republican Jake Ellzey. One former Trump adviser dismissed the idea that Wright’s loss on Tuesday and the Senate’s infrastructure vote had dealt a blow to the former president’s influence over the GOP, blaming the upsets on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellCapitol Police warning of potential for violence during rally backing rioters: report The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Democrats face headwinds on .5 trillion plan, debt ceiling Yellen triggers alarm bells over debt ceiling cliff MORE (R-Ky.) and the conservative Club for Growth, which had encouraged Trump to endorse Wright. “It’s absurd to think that you can take anything away from the Texas race or the Senate vote,” the adviser said. “There are a million issues at play here and it’s got nothing to do with President Trump.” Trump himself disputed Wright’s defeat will damage his reputation in primaries, arguing the GOP won the race regardless.ADVERTISEMENT One former Trump White House official similarly downplayed the long-term significance of Wright’s defeat, but acknowledged Trump must be careful in rushing to endorse candidates. The official said some allies have pushed the former president to endorse early in competitive contests like the Ohio Senate race but that doing so could backfire. Some Republicans are already worried that could be the case in Georgia, where Trump has thrown his weight behind former NFL player Herschel Walker.Others have expressed similar concerns in North Carolina, where Trump has endorsed Rep. Ted BuddTheodore (Ted) Paul BuddOn The Money — Yellen sounds alarm on national default GOP lawmakers urge Cardona against executive student loan wipeout The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - Biden to reboot COVID-19 plan MORE in a hotly contested GOP Senate primary. Budd is up against two high-profile challengers, including former Gov. Pat McCrory, who has a better fundraising record than Budd — and a track record of winning statewide. Trump’s grip over House Republicans remains solid, those close to the former president say. House GOP members regularly travel to meet Trump at his properties in Florida and New Jersey, and the caucus has largely purged itself of Trump critics. But the same cannot be said about the Senate, where Republicans appear more willing to move on from the former president. A Wednesday vote by the Senate to advance a sweeping infrastructure package only served to deepen questions about Trump’s influence. The former president had lobbied against the deal for weeks, issuing half-a-dozen statements urging Republicans to abandon negotiations with Democrats. It wasn’t just Trump’s Republican detractors who broke with him on the infrastructure deal. Among the 17 Republicans who voted to take up debate on the proposal were some of his most ardent allies, including Sens.

The Wednesday infrastructure vote was also seen as a major win for President BidenJoe BidenKentucky state lawmakers vote to scrap school mask mandate Arkansas governor pushes back against Biden's vaccine mandate RNC vows to sue over Biden vaccine, testing mandate MORE, bringing him one step closer to fulfilling a crucial piece of his agenda. That in itself is a knock against Trump, who has openly teased he may run for president in 2024. Cramer told reporters on Thursday that Trump’s frustration may stem from his inability to get a similar agreement during his four years in office. Asked what effect Trump’s efforts to derail the deal seems to have had, Cramer indicated it didn’t move the needle much. “I think it’s on the minds of some people, particularly people in cycle thinking about primaries, I suppose,” said Cramer, who is up for reelection in 2024. “But this is one where I think people know intuitively and by research that the American public, including the majority of Republicans, really do support a reasonable, robust infrastructure package.” Conant, the Republican strategist, noted that Trump’s opposition to the infrastructure deal may carry more water in the House, where loyalty to the former president runs deeper among GOP members. “Trump spends so much time attacking Senate Republicans, we shouldn’t be surprised when they ignore him on big votes. Why would Mitch McConnell, who Trump belittles on a weekly basis, care what Trump says about anything?” Conant said. “The House is slightly different. A lot more of those members are a lot more loyal to Trump, but they’re also the minority, so they have less influence.”ADVERTISEMENT Trump lashed out at Senate Republicans on Thursday morning, blaming McConnell and so-called RINOs — Republicans in name only — for capitulating to Democrats and costing the GOP closely watched elections in Arizona and Georgia. He also urged Republicans to back away from the bipartisan infrastructure package, saying that “no deal is better than a bad deal.” “Fight for America, not for special interests and Radical Democrats,” Trump said in a statement. “RINOs are ruining America, right alongside Communist Democrats.” Trump had endorsed a $2 trillion infrastructure bill with Democratic leaders in 2019, then revived the idea in 2020. But he called off talks the first time around, and no such bill ever materialized last year amid the pandemic. “Infrastructure week” became a recurring punch line during the Trump presidency as lawmakers and administration officials frequently discussed hopes for a deal, only to see it fall through or overshadowed by the latest controversy. Since leaving office in January, Trump has been fixated on maintaining his hold on the GOP. His ability to do so will prove important not only for his legacy, but also for his political future. He has repeatedly floated a potential 2024 presidential campaign and maintaining the loyalty of Republicans will play a critical role in securing the party’s nomination yet again.ADVERTISEMENT To be sure, Trump remains a dominant force among Republican voters nationally. Polling released this week by The Associated Press and NORC at the University of Chicago found that the vast majority of GOP voters — about 81 percent — believe the former president should wield at least some influence over the Republican Party and its future. It’s also difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about Trump’s political influence based on a single runoff contest in a year without any regularly scheduled federal elections. Trump’s brand will be put to the test again in an Ohio special election next week.

One Republican strategist pointed to the race in Texas as evidence that Trump’s endorsement alone won’t necessarily be enough to push a candidate across the finish line — especially next year when Trump is hoping to topple several GOP incumbents in primary contests. “Trump’s political support has never been transferable,” the strategist said. “In most cases, he’s tended to endorse candidates who were going to win anyway. When candidates he supports lose, it’s normally because of other factors in the race or that he just happened to pick a losing horse.”Jordain Carney contributed. View the discussion thread.

I have long believed that the case for obstruction of justice involving efforts to impede the Mueller investigation is far stronger, based on publicly known evidence, than our public discussion would suggest. Additionally, I would assert that while a president can lawfully pardon almost anyone, for almost any crime, a pardon could also be crucial evidence in support of an obstruction of justice case, and potentially an additional count in an obstruction of justice case. If a pardon is offered to influence a witness in a criminal investigation, that pardon could indeed be a crime. There has been evidence that earlier in the case, Trump’s lawyers discussed a pardon with Manafort’s lawyers. It has been reported as well that Trump’s former White House counsel, Donald McGahnDonald (Don) F. McGahnCongress hits rock bottom in losing to the president in subpoena ruling Rudy Giuliani's reputation will never recover from the impeachment hearings In private moment with Trump, Justice Kennedy pushed for Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination: book MORE, has spent many hours cooperating with Mueller and his team. Could McGahn have provided evidence about these alleged pardon discussions? It is now reported that Manafort was essentially double-dealing against Mueller and his investigators, with his lawyers allegedly reporting confidential information to Trump’s lawyers about his discussions with Mueller while he was supposedly cooperating with Mueller. If Trump does pardon Manafort, there is a high probability that these matters are ultimately litigated before and decided by the United States Supreme Court. If Trump does pardon Manafort, the public firestorm of anger and outrage would be so extreme that impeachment consideration would probably be initiated even by a Republican House, and certainly by a Democratic House in January. The smart move for Senate Republicans would be for them to immediately provide protections for Mueller against a Saturday Night Massacre and to publicly and privately warn Trump to not pardon Manafort or move against Mueller.

The most under-discussed aspect of Trump’s involvement in the Russia investigation is the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations for any potential crime that Trump is alleged to have committed would be a minimum of five years from the date that alleged crime was committed. Let's assume hypothetically that Trump is not re-elected president in 2020 and leaves office in January 2021. In this case, under the statute of limitations, if Trump theoretically had committed any crime during the five previous years, he would not be protected by the statute of limitations. Trump’s lawyers all know this, and have undoubtedly advised him of this. Trump’s lawyers also know that a federal pardon would not protect him from any theoretical state crimes and have undoubtedly advised him of this as well. Additionally, if Manafort is pardoned, he would almost immediately be required by Mueller to testify before a grand jury, under penalty of perjury, and would have to testify truthfully, or he would be indicted for new crimes of perjury that would not be covered by the pardon. Trump’s lawyers all know this, and have undoubtedly advised him of this as well. In other words, if Trump pardons Manafort, he protects Manafort only to the degree that Manafort tells the whole truth to the grand jury after the pardon. A pardon would not protect Trump, unless Manafort’s testimony to the grand jury clears him, but if this were the case, Manafort would simply tell this story as part of his cooperation agreement with Mueller. If Manafort is assuming that Trump will pardon him, he is playing a dangerous game with a very high likelihood that Trump is warned by his lawyers to not pardon him, that he will still be indicted in state courts and that he will be forced to testify before the grand jury after the pardon. A Trump pardon of Manafort will be disaster for Trump, Manafort and congressional Republicans alike. Brent Budowsky was an aide to former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and former Rep.

        "articles": "Former Vice President Joe Biden widened his lead in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary to 19 points over second-placed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), according to the latest Quinnipiac poll released Monday. Biden widened his lead after the previous Quinnipiac Poll on July 2 showed Biden's lead over then second-placed candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) had shrunk to just two points shortly after the first Democratic primary debate. Warren placed second in the latest Quinnipiac poll with 15 percent support, up from third in the July 2 poll. Warren was followed closely by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), at third with 12 percent support, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), at fourth with 11 percent support. In the July 2 poll, Harris had placed second, with 20 percent support, after confronting Biden over the former vice president's policy opposition to federally mandated busing during desegregation, while Warren was at third, with 14 percent support. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) again placed fifth, polling at 6 percent. All other candidates in the crowded field are polling at 2 percent or less. The latest Quinnipiac poll was released just ahead the second presidential primary debates set to take place over Tuesday and Wednesday. The Democrats will face-off again in two debates this week, 10 on Tuesday and 10 on Wednesday, in Detroit. Sanders and Warren will be on the same stage the first night, while Biden and Harris will again be on stage together at Wednesday's debate. The poll was conducted from July 25 to 28 and surveyed 1,306 voters nationwide. There is a 3.4 percentage point margin of error.

Do you feel safer than you did a year ago? Are you better because of the surging growth and jobs our policies created? Will you as moms and dads be better because of dramatically increased tax cuts for child care that I and Democrats achieved in our first 100 days, in addition to the $1,400 stimulus checks you received? Last year the nation was on the road to more than 500,000 dead Americans because of the ravages of COVID-19, and in real danger of a new Great Depression in our devastated economy. Today America has achieved dramatic progress toward defeating COVID-19, and begun what will probably be the most powerful surge of growth and jobs in many decades. President Biden deserves a major share of credit for understanding the urgency of achieving exponential increases in the number of Americans vaccinated, achieving the powerful revival of the American economy that he knew would follow from this, and proposing and enacting —over Republican opposition — the most far-reaching, progressive and successful economic recovery program in generations. Historians will, and voters should, give great credit to what was achieved in the first 100 days of the Biden presidency. Remember when President TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE predicted the stock market would crash if Biden were elected? Now Trump would not be remiss writing a thank-you note to Biden for the strong stock market, the strong jobs recovery, the continuing improvement for small business, the strong real estate market and the extraordinary recovery from COVID-19, which all benefit Trump’s business and most of the nation today! On the morning after the midterm elections, one of the two major parties will probably wake up joyous and triumphant and the other party will wake up depressed and despondent. The difference between them will be a comparatively small number of votes in a comparatively small number of states and districts which will determine which party controls the House and Senate. My hope on the infrastructure bill, which I prefer to call the Rebuild America bill or jobs bill, is that both parties compromise between their positions today. What is economically and politically profound, to the great advantage of Democrats, is the party-line vote that occurred on the great economic recovery bill already passed that will lift our economy to the skies this year and beyond. Polls found that between 25 and 60 percent of Republican or Republican-leaning independent voters supported all or important parts of that Biden program. Biden and Democratic candidates for the House and Senate should focus on these voters, in public appearances and paid television ads, in West Virginia and Georgia, and Arizona and Texas, and in every state. Biden and all Democrats should emphasize the Biden tax cuts. Yes, you read that correctly. Analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation and other sources suggest that those earning less than $75,000 will owe close to nothing in federal income taxes, and those making between $75,000 and $100,000 will pay less than 2 percent. Poor and middle-income Moms and Dads will be thrilled to know about the dramatic expansion of the child tax credit and support for dependent care expenses. Many middle-class workers hard hit by COVID-19 will also learn that they benefit from the increase in the earned income tax credit and will actually, in their 2021 returns, receive checks from the IRS in addition to the highly popular $1,400 stimulus checks they already received. Biden and Democrats should talk about these real achievements at every opportunity, every day, in every way, which bring good news to voters. The road will be hard, but the coast is clear about how Democrats can increase their majority in the House and Senate. Budowsky was an aide to former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and former Rep.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The number of undocumented immigrants deported by President Obama is falling and could hit a 10-year low in 2016 just as the issue heats up in this year’s presidential race. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) figures from June suggest 230,000 people could be removed or returned from the country by the end of the fiscal year next month, slightly fewer than the 235,413 deported in 2015. That was the lowest number since 2006. While the total does not include people caught attempting to illegally cross borders, it still highlights a change in enforcement patterns under Obama. Obama was once criticized by Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) on the House floor in 2014 as the “deporter-in-chief” because of the high number of deportations under his administration. In 2012, removals under the Obama administration peaked, with ICE reporting that 409,849 people were sent back to their home countries. The rising number coincided with efforts to reach a deal in Congress on comprehensive immigration reform that would have included a pathway to legal status for undocumented workers in the country. Republicans were demanding that Obama toughen enforcement. After the legislation failed, Obama shifted his strategy, pursuing executive actions that allowed some groups of undocumented immigrants to remain in the country. The White House also exercised executive authority by changing its enforcement priorities to violent offenders, which resulted in a drop in the number of people being arrested within the interior country and deported. “[The Department of Homeland Security] has placed more of a priority on border removals and has tried to scale back on the interior,” said Faye Hipsman, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. While total deportations decreased, the proportion of criminal aliens as a percentage of removals increased from 31 percent in 2008 to 59 percent in 2015. As Obama prepares to leave office, it is Donald TrumpDonald TrumpThe Memo: Biden comes out punching on COVID-19 Ex-Kansas state rep charged with fraud of more than 0K in COVID-19 relief money Medicare trustees sound alarm, but progressives press ahead with irresponsible Medicare expansion MORE who is the center of attention on immigration. On Wednesday, the Republican presidential nominee is scheduled to give an address clarifying his position on immigration. Trump has repeatedly signaled that a softer line on immigration could be coming, even as his campaign has insisted that there will be no change in policy. A big question for Trump is how he handles the issue of the approximately 11 million undocumented workers in the country right now. Trump floated an Obama-like plan last week, saying he would do “the same thing” as Obama in focusing on violent offenders, though he said he would do so “with a lot more energy.” Surrogates have at times spoken favorably of Obama’s deportation record, even as they criticize the president’s executive actions. Trump's campaign has focused on the criminal danger posed by illegal immigration. “Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close I have to tell you, than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders, which we can solve,” Trump said in accepting the nomination at the Republican National Convention in July. Most studies have concluded that immigrants, in the country legally or not, are significantly less likely to commit crimes than native-born residents. Trump could use help courting Hispanic voters. Most polls show Clinton with around 80 percent approval with the constituency, while Trump polls in the low teens. That’s one reason to think Trump will at least change the tone of his approach on Wednesday. The question is whether it will help him with Hispanic voters. Democrats argue the Trump speech is really targeted at moderate white voters. “It’s not a pivot or new approach to Latino and immigrant voters. I just don’t buy it. More importantly, the voters aren’t going to buy it,” Gutiérrez said last week. He argued that Trump's real target is “moderate Republican voters who are uncomfortable with the racism.” View the discussion thread.

All Rights Reserved Keith Olbermann rips the National Rifle Association (NRA) in a new video, calling the gun rights group “a terrorist organization.” Olbermann said on his GQ show “The Resistance” that the NRA enables mass shootings like the one that took place in Las Vegas. He quoted Richard Nixon’s conservative Chief Justice Warren Burger, who said the gun lobby’s interpretation of the Second Amendment is a “fraud on the American people.” “Keep and bear … do not mean ‘own,’ period,” Olbermann said. “The Second Amendment is gun-control from an era where the gun was a musket, and not an automatic killing machine that could be bought and stashed on the 32nd floor of a hotel in order to shoot people 500 at a time.” He also slammed President Trump, saying the president’s expression of “warmest condolences and sympathies” is not sufficient for the epidemic of gun violence. “It is time to end the career of a politician who made his way to the White House dog-whistling to his ‘Second-Amendment people,' ” Olbermann said, referring to a phrase Trump used on the campaign trail. The comedian Michael Ian Black echoed Olbermann’s view on Twitter. The NRA is a terrorist organization. There's no other way to say it. View the discussion thread.
