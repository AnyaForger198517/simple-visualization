        "articles": "LeBron James won’t join San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in kneeling during the national anthem before NBA games, the Cleveland Cavaliers star said Monday at the team’s first media session of the season. But James did speak out against recent police killings that have amplified Kaepernick’s protests, saying that they have created a “scary-ass situation” for those who, like him, are parents of young black children. “My personal feelings is that I got a 12-year-old son, a 9-year-old son, a 2-year-old daughter, and I look at my son being four years removed from being able to drive his own car, being able to leave the house on his own,” James said. “It’s a scary thought right now to think, if my son gets pulled over, and you tell your kids, if you just comply, if you just listen to the police that they’ll be respectful and things will work itself out.” “And you see these videos that continue to come out,” he continued. “It’s a scary-ass situation ― that if my son calls me and says he’s been pulled over, that I’m not that confident that things are going to go well and my son is going to return home.” Watch James’ comments on police brutality: LeBron James on recent police shootings: pic.twitter.com/iz4GawfE8L James and fellow NBA stars Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade took the stage before the ESPY Awards in July to speak out against police violence. James said Monday that while he plans to stand for the national anthem, he is happy Kaepernick and other NFL players who have joined the protests have continued pushing the conversation. “I don’t have the answer, none of us have the answer,” James said. “But the more times that we can talk about it, the more times we can conversate about it. Because I’m not up here saying that all police are bad, because they’re not. I’m not up here saying all kids are great and all adults are great, because they’re not.” “But at the same time, all lives do matter,” he said. “It’s not black or white, it’s not that. It’s everybody. But it’s tough being a parent right now, when you have a pre-teen. But the conversation has continued from the ESPYs speech that myself, CP, D-Wade and Melo had, and that’s definitely a good thing.” James has spoken out against police killings of African-Americans in the past, too. He was among the NBA players to wear “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirts during warm-ups in 2014, after a New York police officer killed Eric Garner in Staten Island. James posted images referencing the police shooting death of Ferguson, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown in 2014, and he, Wade and their then-Miami Heat teammates, posed in hoodies after the killing of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. The NBA and its players’ union said in a statement last week that they anticipated players would bring Kaepernick’s protest to the basketball court, and other NBA players and coaches spoke out about the issue during media sessions on Monday. Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry struck a similar tone as James, saying the killings made him nervous to be a parent. “Me having two younger black kids, making sure people are aware that me growing up, definitely getting pulled over was a scary thing, and definitely was a nervous thing,” Lowry said, the Toronto Star reported. “I think now we have to use our voices.” Lowry’s teammate DeMar DeRozan said he will likely protest. “I had a close friend of mine a couple of weeks ago who was murdered by the police, shot 17 times,” DeRozan said, via the Star. “It was something I haven’t spoke out about. It was more so of just understanding what’s going on in our society and how much I can help. And that’s what it’s all about. So most definitely I think we will, and I will (protest), for sure.” Stephen Curry, who has backed Kaepernick’s protests, reiterated that stance while saying he would stand for the anthem before Golden State Warriors games this season. At the Knicks media day, Anthony said his team would act collectively to address police brutality. John Wall similarly said his Washington Wizards would “talk as a team, as a group, and figure out what we want to do.” San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, meanwhile, said he would respect any of his players’ decision to protest during the anthem if they chose to. “My players are engaged citizens who are fully capable of understanding what their values are, and what they think is appropriate and inappropriate, and what they feel strongly about,” Popovich said. “Whatever actions may or may not be taken are their decisions, and I’m not going to tell anyone ahead of time that if they don’t do A, B and C, they’re going to be gone or traded. I think that’s ignorant.” Los Angeles Lakers guard Nick Young has previously said that he has considered kneeling during the anthem once the season begins.",

        "articles": "If you grow up in America, it's pretty rare if you don't love money. One of the first things I ever remember being punished for was stealing money. Five dollars, off my father's dresser. I was so little, I don't think I even knew it was wrong to take something that wasn't specifically mine -- I recall this being my introduction to the concept of \"larceny is bad.\" But somehow, I knew it was good to have cash. After I left my middle class household at 18, standard of living took a real tumble for a while. At Cornell, I had no money, and boy did I look it. They called where I lived the last three years Collegetown, but Collegetown was really slums in a rural setting. Landlords did not have to work that hard in Ithaca, N.Y. -- every year, there was fresh supply of eager tenants among the students who didn't want to live in a sorority or fraternity. It was a sweet market for a slumlord. But even that looked good compared to what was waiting for me as I began my illustrious career as a standup comedian in New York City in 1979. First year I lived on 99th Street in Spanish Harlem, a five-floor walk up, toilet down the hall. No shower -- a tub that sat in the kitchen with a snake-like attachment that hooked up to the kitchen sink. Walked home every night from the comedy clubs on the tony Upper East Side, watching the neighborhoods become poorer and scarier as I made my way north, and I'm sure the only reason I was never robbed was, they took one look at me and knew it wasn't worth the trouble. Sometimes, freedom really is just another word for nothing left to lose. And yet, in a short 33 years, things had turned around enough so that I was able to give a million dollars to the super PAC of a certain mixed-race president who, I would like to remind all my overconfident progressive friends, does NOT have this election in the bag. And a lot of people this last week have said the same thing to me: \"You're not picking up the drinks tonight?\" The great thing about having been poor is how liberated it makes you if you eventually become rich. There's nothing like the knowledge that you don't need money to survive. That the money cushion you lie on every night doesn't have to be three feet thick, and you can still get to sleep. Other people seemed surprised I had a million dollars, which amused me. I've had a television show since 1993; television pays well -- I may even have another million lying around somewhere. Every year when I visit my accountant in December to see how the year went, he always says I'm the best saver of all his clients, which amazes me, because I feel like I deprive myself of absolutely nothing. I once asked him, what do your other clients spend their money on? Because I know who some of his other clients are, and I know they make WAY more than I do. He said that what they spend their money on is always changing, and that's not even the point -- the point is, however much money they make that year, they always spend all of it! That's how they think: have money, spend it, because the real tragedy would be to die and have money left over. Me? I just don't have expensive tastes I guess -- I don't collect cars or paintings or jewelry, and I gave up my heroin habit years ago. But I also know that, as I said when I presented that giant check to Priorities USA Action last Thursday at the end of my stand up special on Yahoo!, \"This hurts!\" I was trying to make the point that if I could do it, a lot of other people could do it a lot more easily than me. You know, the only place in America where the millionaires and billionaires are predominantly liberal is here in Hollywood -- with the possible exception of Silicon Valley and Ben & Jerry's ice cream. There's a reason that of the 16 billionaires that have contributed to super PACs this year, 14 have given to Republicans. It is generally the party of the rich. And in a post-Citizens United world, the party of the rich has an advantage like they've never had before. In 2008, the most you could give to a candidate was $2,300. Now it's Infinity. No, the election is not in the bag. Host of HBO's \"Real Time with Bill Maher\"",

        "articles": "A national transit workers union threw its weight behind presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday, endorsing the Vermont independent over Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. The Amalgamated Transit Union waited longer than most major unions before endorsing a candidate in the race for the White House. Union leadership said it had carried out a careful and deliberative process with union members before deciding to side with Sanders. “The sincerity of Bernie Sanders and his long standing fidelity to the issues that are so important to working people are what convinced us that standing with Bernie is standing with the 99% of America that has been left out of the mainstream public debate, cheated out of our jobs and denied the true meaning of the American dream,” Larry Hanley, the union's president, said in a statement. Since announcing their candidacies, Clinton and Sanders have had a long and protracted battle for the backing of organized labor. By any measure, Clinton is way out in front of the self-described democratic socialist. In October, she locked up endorsements from unions representing the majority of unionized workers in the U.S., including the largest public sector labor groups in the country. But a handful of progressive unions have broken with the pack and declared their support for Sanders. That includes the Communications Workers of America, National Nurses United, the American Postal Workers Union, and now the ATU. Most important for Sanders, those unions' backing has helped stave off a potential endorsement of Clinton by the AFL-CIO, the national labor federation they are all members of. Many unions came out in favor of Clinton long before Sanders became a viable threat for the Democratic nomination. Before ATU made its endorsement, Hanley told The Huffington Post that union leadership had made a conscious decision to wait before backing any one of the candidates. \"We think campaigns matter,\" Hanley said. \"We think that until people campaign, you don't get a good sense of how they'll govern. In fairness to all the candidates and our members, we thought it was important that we wait and watch and hear what the candidates have to say and how they come out on positions.\" Though union membership has dwindled significantly, labor unions remain a pillar of the Democratic base. Democratic candidates perennially rely on unions to make phone calls, knock on doors and generally steer financial support to their campaigns. The Citizens United ruling that allows corporate America to spend unlimited amounts on political campaigns also applies to unions, though organized labor's coffers aren't nearly as deep and rely primarily on member dues. ATU represents 190,000 members working mostly in bus and rail jobs. As of December, the union's political action committee had raised $1 million for this election cycle, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. The union's contributions have gone overwhelmingly toward Democrats. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "SHOCKER: Bernie scored four major wins by large margins in Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Vermont during the March 1 Super Tuesday contest, doing far better than expected, despite what the corporate media reported. I listened to National Public Radio on the morning following the Democratic Party Fix... I mean... Primary, and the pro-Clinton propaganda was shocking. NPR reported that Hillary was the big winner Tuesday -- and that the Sanders effort was coming to a close. They noted specifically that Clinton had an important big win in Massachusetts. It was, in fact, a win by a slim 1% margin, or 17,000 votes out of 1.2 million cast. The rest of the corporate media was complicit in promoting this big \"top story.\" The New York Times headline the day following Super Tuesday read, \"Sanders's Path to Victory All but Blocked.\" The article explained that \"If Mr. Sanders can't win in a place like Massachusetts, it is hard to come up with many places where he can.\" The Clinton propagandist masquerading as a New York Times reporter might have found an answer to his question by simply disclosing election results of the other four states that voted, with unexpectedly huge margins, for Sanders on Super Tuesday. So might listeners of NPR, had the radio network of record not been so keen to rush into a morning-after eulogy for the Sanders campaign. What few readers or listeners learned was that on Super Tuesday, Bernie Sanders: • Won the important swing state of Colorado by 19 points • Won Minnesota by 23 points • Won Oklahoma by 10 points • Won in his home state of Vermont by 72 points, (86% to 14%), Bernie's Vermont win may go down in modern history as the greatest state primary victory over a front-running Presidential candidate. Meanwhile, the jury is out whether will Hillary even win her home state of New York. Put these numbers in the context of the only result that NPR's morning after election report considered worthy of reporting in its \"Hillary is now inevitable\" segment: that Hillary had a big win in Massachusetts. Her 1% marginal victory, a near-tie, was the noteworthy takeaway, while NOT EVEN MENTIONING wins 10 to 20 times times larger for Bernie in Minnesota, Colorado and Oklahoma. One also needs to wonder about the media drumbeat of polls that suggest Sanders is a lost cause. For example, this poll (with a \"margin of error of 5.9%\") of registered Minnesota Democrats reported in the Minneapolis StarTribune on January 22, 2016 said that Hillary was the projected winner, with Clinton at 59% and Sanders at 25%. The actual March 1 results? Clinton 38% and Sanders 61%! The false narrative or America's corporate media is that Hillary is inevitable. Implicit in this propaganda is that she is the better candidate to win in November. As polls repeatedly show, Clinton's November advantage over a Republican nominee is an outright falsehood, and the inevitability is only true if the media and establishment Democrats can convince voters that it is. Meanwhile, entirely unreported in Hillary's Super Tuesday victory story is any mention that, with the exception of Virginia (indeed Hillary's most important victory to date) the Southern states Hillary had won by large numbers (South Carolina, Texas, Georgia, Arkansas, Alabama, and Mississippi) have virtually NO CHANCE of providing a single electoral vote to a Democrat in the November General Election. That's because ALL of the electoral votes in these states will go to the Republican candidates. And that Hillary's huge win over Sanders in these Southern states will be meaningless to the Democratic candidate come November. Bernie's huge win by 19 points in the key swing state of Colorado and his unpredicted landslide in Minnesota are far more indicative of which candidate would likely beat Trump than what happened in Alabama. There seems to be a corporate media blackout on such insight, one geared to leading voters into the \"Hillary has it in the bag\" narrative that they and the Democratic Party machine have been pushing since this election began. If we disregard the Super Delegates, which we should because by law they do not legally commit until they see the will of the voters during the convention in late July, then here is where this election really stands: Clinton: 577, Sanders 394 delegates. With 2,383 needed for nomination. Given that most of the largest Clinton advantaged states- the deep South--are behind us now, and the Bernie-leaning Western states, working class industrial Midwest, and liberal Northeast, have not yet voted, the \"Path to Victory All but Blocked\" narrative of the New York Times, reflects not our reality, but the wishful thinking of the corporate media and Democratic Party establishment.

I had dinner with him last Monday.” Stone denied having direct contact with Assange himself. In August, even before the emails were released, Stone alluded to “Podesta’s time in the barrel.” Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel. #CrookedHillary Last week, Stone sneered at the ongoing FBI investigation into the Trump team’s ties to Russia, calling it a “witch hunt.” “Sure, they’ll get my grocery lists,” he said. “They may get the emails between my wife and I, but here’s what they won’t get ― any contact with the Russians.” The New York Times reported last month that Stone is one of several Trump advisers under FBI investigation for contact with Russian officials. But Stone denied that he was being investigated, telling NBC that “they won’t find anything of this nature.” “They’d be pretty bored if they wanted to look at my e-mails or transmissions because they won’t find anything of this nature,” he said. “I have no Russian clients.

        "articles": "The Trump administration transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency earlier this year to fund immigrant detention and deportation efforts, according to a document released Tuesday by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore). The lawmaker first shared the documents with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, saying that the Department of Homeland Security requested the money “just as hurricane season [was] starting” and as it was attempting to fund Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the midst of its new “zero tolerance” immigration policy. The controversial crackdown resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents, hundreds of whom have yet to be reunited. “This is a scandal. At the start of hurricane season — when American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still suffering from FEMA’s inadequate recovery efforts — the administration transferred millions of dollars away from FEMA,” Merkley said in a statement to HuffPost. “And for what? To implement their profoundly misguided ‘zero tolerance’ policy. It wasn’t enough to rip thousands of children out of the arms of their parents — the administration chose to partly pay for this horrific program by taking away from the ability to respond to damage from this year’s upcoming and potentially devastating hurricane season.” Unbelievable? Yes. Reprehensible? Yes. But it’s true. Look for yourself: pic.twitter.com/O0SxI9p5ho The document’s release comes just days before Hurricane Florence, a powerful Category 4 storm, is expected to make landfall in the Carolinas. Millions of people are currently evacuating or hunkering down. “$10 million comes out of FEMA when we’re facing a hurricane season knowing what’s happened last year,” Merkley told Maddow on Tuesday. “And look what we’ve had since, a hurricane just barely miss Hawaii. ... Now we have this hurricane, Florence, bearing down on the Carolinas.” DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton late Tuesday called the senator’s appearance a “sorry attempt to push a false agenda,” saying the administration was instead “focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster.” “The money in question — transferred to ICE from FEMA’s routine operating expenses — could not have been used for hurricane response due to appropriation limitations,” Houlton wrote on Twitter. “DHS/FEMA stand fiscally and operationally ready to support current and future response and recovery needs.” Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster. The document released by Merkley, which was supplied to HuffPost, states that more than $2.3 million from a total of about $9.8 million had been diverted from FEMA’s “response and recovery” budget. Other funding was transferred from regional operations, mitigation efforts, preparedness and protection, and mission support budgets. The amount transferred is less than 1 percent of FEMA’s budget for the fiscal year, according to the document, which also notes that the agency’s “mission impact” would be minimized as FEMA would only be required to “curtail training, travel, public engagement sessions, IT security support and infrastructure maintenance, and IT investments.” The Department of Homeland Security has the authority to move a limited amount of money around within its budget. In the past, Congress had limited DHS from shuffling more than $5 million from one approved program to another through the process known as “reprogramming.” A coalition of human rights groups penned a letter on June 27 asking the Senate Committee on Appropriations to oppose attempts by DHS to up the amount of funding for immigrant detention, accusing the department of “dramatically overspending its appropriated budget in ways both morally reprehensible and fiscally irresponsible.” The $10 million of additional funds that DHS aims to use to expand immigrant detention amounts to less than 1 percent of the ICE budget for locking up immigrants, which tops $1.4 billion.

        "articles": "Matt Damon, one of Barack Obama's earliest supporters and once one of his most staunch advocates, slammed the President in the new issue of Elle Magazine. \"I've talked to a lot of people who worked for Obama at the grassroots level. One of them said to me, 'Never again. I will never be fooled again by a politician,'\" Damon tells the magazine. \"You know, a one-term president with some balls who actually got stuff done would have been, in the long run of the country, much better.\" Referring to the Occupy Wall Street movement, Damon continued: \"If the Democrats think that they didn't have a mandate -- people are literally without any focus or leadership, just wandering out into the streets to yell right now because they are so pissed off ... Imagine if they had a leader.\" That echoes the President's own words to Diane Sawyer in March of 2010 when he said, \"I'd rather be a really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president... There's a tendency in Washington to think that our job description, of elected officials, is to get reelected. That's not our job description. Our job description is to solve problems and to help people.\" The slam follows in the same vein as a number of other criticisms Damon has made of the President and the Democrats, including in March, when he criticized Obama's education policy. \"I really think he misinterpreted his mandate. A friend of mine said to me the other day, I thought it was a great line, 'I no longer hope for audacity,'\" Damon told CNN host Piers Morgan. \"He's doubled down on a lot of things, going back to education... the idea that we're testing kids and we're tying teachers salaries to how kids are performing on tests, that kind of mechanized thinking has nothing to do with higher order. We're training them, not teaching them.\" Later that month, he hit Obama on his handling of the economic crisis. \"I think he's rolled over to Wall Street completely. The economy has huge problems. We still have all these banks that are too big to fail. They're bigger and making more money than ever. Unemployment at 10 percent? It's terrible,\" he told the Independent. Damon also criticized the President's inability to get transformative things done, saying, \"They had a chance that they don't have any more to stand up for things. They've probably squandered that at this point. They'll probably just make whatever deals they can to try to get elected again.\" Currently, Obama and the Democrats are fighting with the House GOP over passing a compromise two month extension of the payroll tax cuts and unemployment benefits, amongst other things; they've already removed increased taxes on the wealthy from the deal. Damon's criticism rings with disappointment after he so publicly lent his support to the then-Senator Obama during the 2008 election. He spent time campaigning for the then-candidate at rallies, promoting him through a MoveOn video contest and attending fundraisers for the man who would become the 44th President. In August, the star ripped a cameraman and reporter from a conservative publication who challenged his stance on education at a Save Our Schools event in Washington, DC. He then moved on to economic policy criticism. \"The wealthy are paying less than they paid at any time else, certainly in my lifetime, and probably in the last century,\" Damon told a reporter at the same event. \"I don't know what we were paying in the Roaring '20s; it's criminal that so little is asked of people who are getting so much. I don't mind paying more. I really don't mind paying more taxes. I'd rather pay for taxes than cut 'Reading is Fundamental' or Head Start or some of these programs that are really helping kids. This is the greatest country in the world; is it really that much worse if you pay 6% more in taxes? Give me a break. Look at what you get for it: you get to be American.\" Speaking of the then-protracted negotiations over the debt ceiling, he did show some sympathy for Obama. \"I'm so disgusted,\" he said. \"I mean, no, I don't know what you do in the face of that kind of intransigence. So, my heart does go out to the President. He is dealing with a lot.\" Scarlett Johansson, Damon's co-star in the upcoming film \"We Bought A Zoo,\" recently said that she wanted Obama elected to another four year term. The President still enjoys support in Hollywood, having recently attended fundraisers in Los Angeles filled with stars. Obama responded jokingly to Damon's criticism at his White House Press Correspondents Dinner in late April, saying, \"It's fair to say that when it comes to my presidency, the honeymoon is over ... Matt Damon said he [has been] disappointed in my performance. Well Matt, I just saw the 'Adjustment Bureau,' so ... right back atcha buddy.\" Earlier this month, Damon said he found the dig, which referenced his poorly reviewed sci-fi action film that came out last winter, pretty funny.

        "articles": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticized former President Bill Clinton for recently defending his wife Hillary Clinton's use of the term \"super-predators\" while discussing a controversial 1994 crime bill. \"I think we all knew back then what that language meant,\" Sanders told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. \"That was referring to young blacks. And I don't think in this country, elected officials or leaders should be using that type of terminology.\" While Hillary Clinton, who is now Sanders' rival for the Democratic nomination, has already apologized for using the term, Sanders said her husband also owes the country an apology. The dispute started when former President Clinton got into an exchange with Black Lives Matter protesters who brought up the 1994 legislation during his recent speech in Philadelphia. The bill is still hotly debated, since crime rates had already begun to drop before it was passed. Some policymakers who supported the bill now say they have come to regret it, and even the former president has said some of the effects of the bill he signed \"cannot be justified.\" Both Sanders and Hillary Clinton, who was then serving as first lady, supported the crime bill at the time. Stephanopoulos, a former official in the Clinton White House, asked Sanders if he had any \"second thoughts\" about doing so. \"Well, that bill was one of these bills that had good things in it and it had bad things in it,\" Sanders replied. \"If I had voted against that bill, you would be asking me, 'Bernie, why did you vote against the ban on assault weapons?'\" \"The Violence Against Women Act ... you would say, 'Bernie don't you -- aren't you concerned about domestic violence?'\" he continued. \"But if you check the record, I was on the floor talking about many of the negative aspects of that, including the death penalty, which I strongly oppose.\" The bottom line, Sanders said, \"is that we need major criminal justice reform in a very broken system. As Americans, we should not accept the fact that we have more people in jail. We need reforms of local police departments all over this country. And I intend, if elected president, to work very aggressively about that.\" Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "WASHINGTON ― At the time ― only about a month ago ― Obama administration officials thought the move was a swell idea; good for national security and a subtle way to twist the knife in the president-elect on the topic of Russian election hacking. But it may have been the riskiest decision of the Obama years, opening a legal door to Donald Trump forces looking to control future access to the ballot box in the name of national security, and to a new president who decries millions of (phantom) “fraudulent” votes he claims were illegally cast against him. Here’s how the Obama administration did it. On Jan. 6, the administration released a devastating report on Russian involvement in the presidential election, buttressing those trying to undermine the validity of Trump’s Electoral College victory. On the same day, and not by coincidence, then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson issued an official designation as part of the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, designed, at least in part, to show just how seriously the outgoing Obama national security team regarded such intrusions. In a four-page notice, Johnson said that, henceforth, “election infrastructure in this country” would gain protection as part of the “Government Facilities critical infrastructure.” It was now “critical infrastructure,” just like dams, the electric grid, financial services and a host of other sectors. And what did he mean by “election infrastructure?” Everything, from the voting machine in your precinct to the big data on tote boards on your TV screen: “By ‘election infrastructure’ we mean storage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulation locations used to support the election process; and information and communications technology to include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage the election process and report and display results on behalf of state and local governments.” Johnson had been mulling the designation for months, and admitted in his announcement that it had faced opposition from “many state and local election officials.” He insisted the move “does not mean a federal takeover, regulation, oversight or intrusion concerning elections in this country.” It meant only that election infrastructure would become a “priority” within the national security plan, and that “cybersecurity assistance” would be available but “only for those who request it.” Many state officials were not impressed with the explanation and remain so. In fact, they tend to be scared when feds offer “help;” they know there are always strings of Washington control attached to the money. State officials are jealous of their prerogatives and fully aware that the U.S. Constitution mandates state control of elections, up to and including ― and in a way especially ― the presidential race. The only exception, and it is major one, is for civil rights, and that, too, was mandated by Constitutional amendment. Last fall, the proposed DHS designation was opposed by libertarian scholars and election officials in places known for allegiance to “states rights” ― places such as Kansas and Georgia. Officials there remain opposed, according to representatives for the secretaries of state in both. Several other states have joined their ranks. More significantly, now that the “states’ rights” theory has become attractive to those who fear Trump, California has weighed in with concerns. While protecting electoral systems is important, California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said recently, “it is unclear if the incoming administration will abide by Secretary Johnson’s definition of the limits.” Libertarian and conservative critics note that the decentralization of the American voting system is actually its greatest protection, and that centralizing it legally and digitally would make it more ― not less ― vulnerable. More important, they worry that it would make possible a federal “Trojan horse,” said Heritage scholar Hans von Spakovsky. Such a power grab could allow DHS officials “access to any and every voting location they deem threatened,” and give them authority to “investigate, prosecute, disrupt and otherwise reduce” any perceived threats. And, under the terms of the DHS rules, discussions of such “national security” threats to voting and decision-making to deal with them would be exempt from public view, not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Trump’s now-confirmed DHS secretary, John Kelly, received only one written question on the topic, and vaguely answered (or someone answered for him) that it was unclear whether elections belonged under such a critical infrastructure regime. But sources in the national security community, in the Trump administration and on Capitol Hill told The Huffington Post that, as of Wednesday afternoon, the designation had not been rescinded; nor was anyone aware of a move afoot to do so. Johnson declined to comment. White House press secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly declined to comment, as did a spokesman for DHS. This issue will take center stage at the Washington meeting of state officials later this month. An organization representing secretaries of state has asked for clarifications and guidance, but so far has received none, according to Kay Stimson of the National Association of Secretaries of State. With Republicans in charge in most states, it is not clear how much they will be willing to put their fiery principles ahead of their desire to remain in power in their jurisdictions. Meanwhile, former Obama administration officials and Democratic allies on the Hill brushed aside concerns raised in recent days about possible Trump administration use ― or misuse ― of the designation. “It’s a bunch of people in a fever swamp worrying about something that is merely advisory and a good idea to begin with,” said one top Democratic staffer who did not have permission to speak on the record. “I trust John Kelly to get it right,” said a former high-ranking Obama administration national security official, also declining to be quoted on the record ― in his case out of a desire to give the new administration a chance to “do the right thing” without public prodding. Even if Kelly is the stand-up guy Democrats think he is, it isn’t clear how much power he will have in Trump World. After all, he wasn’t immediately “read in” on what was happening with Trump’s immigration ban. Though he is a regular member of the newly revived Homeland Security Council, Trump political mastermind Steve Bannon is a member of it, too. Who knows what threats Bannon ― or Trump ― may find lurking in the electoral system in 2018 or 2020? And who knows what measures DHS might deem necessary to “protect” that system? Thanks to the unintended assistance of Obama administration, we may find out soon enough. Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

        "articles": "NEW YORK -- Around 5 p.m. on Election Day 2012, Fox News chief Roger Ailes realized that Mitt Romney would not make it to the White House. \"Thank you, Chris Christie,\" Ailes groused. Ailes was frustrated that the New Jersey governor appeared alongside President Barack Obama days earlier to survey the damage of Hurricane Sandy. When Ailes was told polling data suggested the incident hadn't hurt the Republican Party's chances, he responded: \"Well, hugging the guy couldn't help people feel good about Romney, either.\" This wasn't how the race was supposed to end. During an afternoon meeting before the 2010 midterm elections, Ailes told executives he wanted \"to elect the next president.\" Fox News already ruled the ratings and boasts annual earnings of around $1 billion. Most network chiefs would be ecstatic. But Ailes isn’t like most –- or really, any -– other top cable news executives. A visionary in the world of political messaging on television, Ailes had advised three past Republican presidents on how to use the medium to their advantage. And now he planned to use his talents for the party once more. With the exception of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ailes had privately knocked the 2008 Republican field as the “seven dwarves\" and wasn't impressed with the crop of 2012 contenders. He unsuccessfully tried twice to convince Christie to run in 2012 and sent an emissary to Afghanistan with hopes that Gen. David Petraeus would enter the race. During a meeting at Fox, Ailes told candidate Jon Huntsman, who had a solid conservative record as Utah governor, he was “not of our orthodoxy” because of his views on climate change. He grew frustrated with Fox News contributor Sarah Palin, who ended up sitting out the 2012 race, and had misgivings about the party's eventual nominee, Mitt Romney. Ailes once privately told a Fox host that Romney is \"like Chinese food -- 20 minutes after you eat it, you can't remember what you had.\" How Ailes tried to get a Republican president elected in 2012 is revealed in The Loudest Voice In The Room, author Gabriel Sherman's sweeping biography of the television luminary, from his humble Warren, Ohio, roots to becoming the “most powerful opposition figure in the country.” The book will be on sale Tuesday. Sherman recalls Ailes’ early days as a young hot-shot producer on the “Mike Douglas Show” and his entrance into politics in 1968 as a media adviser to then-presidential candidate Richard Nixon, who had faltered eight years earlier in the first televised president debate against the telegenic John F. Kennedy. Sherman exhaustively covers Ailes’ career, from an upstate New York newspaper war to building the lucrative cable network where his TV instincts, ability to frame political narratives and conservative worldview all coalesced: Fox News. Controlling Narratives On-Screen And Off This isn’t the story Roger Ailes wanted told about his life. Sherman, a contributing editor for New York magazine, wrote a much-discussed October 2010 cover story on the cable news network, and four months later, landed a book deal on Ailes and Fox News. However, he hadn't negotiated access to the Fox News chief. Ailes' readiness for a fight and need for control filters down to the Fox News’ PR shop, which is the most combative in the business and functions like the opposition research arm of a campaign. Fox News employees try to ensure that the network is defined on its own terms and will strike back when it's not. NPR’s David Folkenflik recently revealed how employees used “aliases to post pro-Fox rants” on blog posts and Sherman, in his book, described how Ailes conceived of “The Cable Game.” Fox News contributor Jim Pinkerton anonymously wrote entries for the now-shuttered media blog, which routinely swiped at Fox News critics, rival cable hosts and media reporters. Last week, Fox News claimed that Sherman's book is inaccurate since the author didn’t fact-check it in advance with the network and because Ailes refused to grant him an interview. Sherman has said he spoke to more than 600 sources for the book and employed two fact-checkers who spent more than 2,000 hours on it. Details in the book are meticulously referenced and it includes over 100 pages of endnotes and bibliography. Ailes declined interview requests from Sherman and instead selected Rush Limbaugh-biographer Zev Chafets to tell his story. Fox News stars then promoted Chafets' flattering look at Ailes' life when it was released in March. Over the past two weekends, advertisements for Chafets' 10-month-old book have appeared in the New York Times Book Review, though the book's publisher wouldn't reveal who purchased them. A Times spokesperson told HuffPost that The Dilenschneider Group, a strategic communications firm, purchased the Book Review ads for just over $15,000. Founder Robert Dilenschneider -- who once downplayed the phone hacking scandal that rocked Fox News-parent News Corp. -- did not respond to HuffPost’s questions about why his firm purchased the ads as the less-flattering Ailes biography was hitting the shelves on Jan. 14. Sherman’s book, however, sheds some light on a possible motive: Dilenschneider, he wrote, is Ailes' \"personal PR consultant.” 'If There’s A Fight, We Should Be The One Doing The Shooting' As Ailes sought to take control of his legacy, he simultaneously kept his eyes on the 44th president. Fox News dialed up the anti-Obama rhetoric as soon as Obama took office, with Glenn Beck’s 5 p.m. show launching in Jan. 2009. Beck, who turned the network’s afternoon “black hole” into a ratings bonanza, ignited controversy months later by claiming Obama harbored a “deep-seated hatred for white people.” Sherman wrote that Ailes privately told executives he agreed with Beck’s remark. Ailes, who is prone to fits of rage and appears in the book as increasingly paranoid, holds a number of theories about Obama and the Democrats. Sherman wrote how Ailes “told his advisers that if Obama were reelected, he could be prosecuted and jailed, like a political prisoner.” And a Murdoch family intimate told Sherman that Ailes believed the Democratic National Committee \"had targeted him [Ailes] for assassination.\" In April 2009, Fox News began heavily promoting the conservative tea party movement and hired Palin the following January as an on-air contributor. Ailes' TV instincts proved correct as the anti-Obama right tuned in and ratings shot up. But some establishment Republicans worried about Ailes' political acumen as polarizing figures on Fox News, such as Palin and Beck, began to define the party. “Why are you letting Palin have the profile?” veteran Republican operative Karl Rove asked Ailes in a meeting, according to the book. “Why are you letting her go on your network and say the things she’s saying? And Glenn Beck? These are alternative people who will never be elected and they’ll kill us.” Fox News and Beck -- who started building his own, separate media empire as his popularity soared -– split in April 2011, and five months later, Ailes claimed the network was making a “course correction” away from fiery, anti-Obama programming. But the raucous Republican primary continued, with some Romney staffers blaming Fox News for the candidate’s loss in the South Carolina primary. Days earlier, then-GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich engaged in a racially charged exchange with Fox News debate moderator Juan Williams that drew cheers from the audience. Sherman wrote that Romney media strategist Stuart Stevens told campaign advisers that \"he thought Ailes put a black newsman onstage as a way of symbolically putting Obama in a room filled mainly with white conservatives\" and therefore Gingrich's heated response became \"a symbolic smack-down of the president.” Ailes dismissed internal concerns that the primary circus would hurt Republicans' chances in the general election. “You can create a Reagan through an intra-party fight,” Ailes told an executive, according to the book. “If there’s a fight, we should be the one doing the shooting.” During Ronald Reagan's reelection campaign in 1984, Ailes was brought aboard to help the president overcome a shaky debate performance. Four years later, Ailes pushed former President George H. W. Bush Sr. when he was running, to overcome his \"wimp\" reputation. Bush appreciated Ailes' candor, such as telling the candidate he looked \"like a fucking clerk\" in a short-sleeve shirt he'd planned to wear at a speech. Ailes advised Bush to go on the offense against CBS News anchor Dan Rather in the face of tough questions about the Iran-Contra scandal. Similarly, Ailes suggested to Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol that Romney should go for the jugular in 2012. According to Sherman's book, Ailes said: \"Romney’s gotta rip Obama’s face off. It’s really hard to do. I did this with Bush Sr. He was uncomfortable with ripping Dukakis’s face off. George had to tell Barbara, ‘Look, this is Roger’s thing.’ It made Barbara uncomfortable that George was going to negative, but I had to rip off [Democratic challenger Michael] Dukakis’s face.” During the final months of the 2012 campaign, Ailes helped prep vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan and recommended an adviser to help with his television performance, according to the book. Any casual Fox News viewer in 2012 could see how the network was pulling for Romney, either by hyping an out-of-context remark from Obama about redistribution, or by distorting a widely covered 2007 campaign speech that addressed issues of race and poverty. The morning after Romney won the hard-fought Republican primary, \"Fox & Friends\" aired what was essentially a four-minute attack ad against Obama. But Sherman's book fills in the story with behind-the-scenes details, typically provided by anonymous sources. For instance, Sherman wrote that the \"Fox & Friends\" video was \"Ailes's brainchild,\" a version of events that conflicts with Fox News' statement at the time that senior management wasn't aware of it. On Election Night, Rove famously melted down on Fox News as the network announced that Ohio, and therefore the election, was lost. Obama's decisive reelection prompted soul-searching among Republicans, including how the prospect of a Romney victory seemed so likely on Fox News and within the conservative media bubble. Ailes, 73, has signed on to steer Fox News through 2016. And so whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a presumed frontrunner, or someone else, becomes the Democratic nominee it should be expected that Fox News will be on the attack. Just because Ailes lost a battle, doesn’t mean the war’s over. (Disclosure: The reporter worked with Sherman at The New York Observer.)",

        "articles": "The Obama administration's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal is an \"assault,\" on working people intended to further corporate \"domination,\" according to author and activist Noam Chomsky. “It’s designed to carry forward the neoliberal project to maximize profit and domination, and to set the working people in the world in competition with one another so as to lower wages to increase insecurity,” Chomsky said during an interview with HuffPost Live. WATCH Chomsky's comments in the video above. The Obama administration has been negotiating the TPP pact with 11 other Pacific nations for years. While the deal has not been finalized and much of it has been classified, American corporate interest groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have already voiced strong support for the TPP, describing it as a free trade deal that will encourage economic growth. The Office of U.S. Trade Representative has also defended the talks, saying the TPP will include robust regulatory protections. But labor unions and a host of traditionally liberal interest groups, including environmentalists and public health advocates, have sharply criticized the deal. Chomsky argues that much of the negotiations concern issues outside of what many consider trade, and are focused instead on limiting the activities governments can regulate, imposing new intellectual property standards abroad and boosting corporate political power. “It’s called free trade, but that’s just a joke,\" Chomsky said. \"These are extreme, highly protectionist measures designed to undermine freedom of trade. In fact, much of what's leaked about the TPP indicates that it's not about trade at all, it’s about investor rights.” The Obama administration is treating the precise terms of the deal as classified information, blocking many Congressional staffers from viewing the negotiation texts and limiting the information available to members of Congress themselves. The deal's only publicly available negotiation documents have come to light through document leaks. Recent documents have been published by WikiLeaks and HuffPost. According to these leaked documents, the TPP would empower corporations to directly challenge laws and regulations set by foreign nations before an international tribunal. The tribunal would be given the authority to not only overrule that nation's legal standards but also impose economic penalties on it. Under World Trade Organization treaties, corporations must convince a sovereign nation to bring trade cases before an international court. Chomsky said the deal is an escalation of neoliberal political goals previously advanced by the WTO and the North American Free Trade Agreement. \"It's very hard to make anything of the TPP because it's been kept very secret,\" Chomsky told HuffPost Live. \"A half-secret, I should say. It's not secret from the hundreds of corporate lawyers and lobbyists who are writing the legislation. To them, it's perfectly public. They're, in fact, writing it. It's being kept secret from the population. Which of course raises obvious questions.\" Several members of Congress, including Obama's fellow Democrats, have attacked the intense secrecy surrounding the talks. But others want to give the TPP the \"fast track\" to passage; Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced legislation on Thursday that would prevent members of Congress from offering legislative amendments to whatever final trade deal Obama reaches. But the move to fast track the TPP hit headwinds in the House, where no Democrat has agreed to co-sponsor the legislation. Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said the fast track bill cannot pass without Democratic support. Chomsky quipped that of course the administration and lawmakers would want to speed up a sweeping trade deal that may be more in the interest of corporations than the public. “It’s very understandable that it should be kept secret from the public,\" Chomsky said, \"why should people know what’s happening to them?” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R), Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick, opposed a successful effort in 2007 to raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour over two years. Pence, then a congressman, took to the House floor to explain why he opposed raising the minimum wage, which was then $5.15 an hour. “A 41 percent increase in the minimum wage that is brought into the well of Congress without providing any relief to small business owners and family farmers is irresponsible and unwise,” he said. “It will harm both the wage payer and the wage earner. An excessive increase in the minimum wage will hurt the working poor.” Raising the minimum wage is enormously popular with the American public. In a letter sent to Congress in 2014, over 600 economists noted “the weight of evidence now showing that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers, even during times of weakness in the labor market.” The measure eventually passed the House 348 to 73 as part of a package on Iraq spending, according to The New York Times. The legislation included $4.84 billion in tax breaks for small businesses. It’s not the only time Pence has blocked efforts to raise the minimum wage. In 2013, he signed a law blocking local governments in Indiana from requiring businesses to offer higher wages or benefits beyond those required by federal law, according to the Times of Northwest Indiana. In 2015, Pence also repealed a law that required construction companies working on publicly funded projects to pay a prevailing wage, which effectively set a wage floor to prevent different construction firms from cutting wages in an effort to lower their bids. Pence’s running mate has changed his own position on the minimum wage repeatedly. Last year, he said he did not support raising the minimum wage, but he has also expressed an openness to raising it. Hillary Clinton has said she would sign a bill setting a $15 minimum wage ― though her position on the issue hasn’t always been so clear. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina's explanation for a controversial business practice undertaken by Hewlett Packard during her time running that company appears incomplete, if not misleading. On Sunday, the rising GOP primary star was pressed on allegations that her former company did business with Iran during a time when U.S companies were prohibited from doing so. In response, Fiorina stressed three separate points: that she was unaware that a subsidiary of Hewlett Packard had been selling printers in that country; that an \"investigation\" by the Securities Exchange Commission \"proved\" her innocence; and that HP only discovered the transactions three years after she left the company: Three years after -- in fact the S.E.C. investigation proved that neither I nor anyone else in management knew about it, and the facts of the matter were the European subsidiary apparently was doing business with another company in the Middle East. That company was doing business with another company, that was doing doing business with Iran. And when the company discovered this three years after I left, they cut off all ties with those companies. The S.E.C. investigated very thoroughly and concluded that no one in management was aware. All of these points are missing significant nuance, and some seem at odds with surrounding context. On the first point, it is true that there is no direct evidence showing Fiorina was aware of HP's business dealings in Iran. Moreover, sanctions experts say it is not uncommon -- nor illegal -- for corporate executives to be caught off guard when a distributor is doing business with a sanctioned country. \"The typical practice for those who comply with the law is to put a clause in the distribution contract indicating that the distributor will not distribute the product to embargoed country and to anyone you know who will distribute to embargoed companies,\" Clif Burns, a D.C.-based lawyer who specializes in export law, told the Huffington Post. Burns was speaking generally and not about HP specifically. \"You are going to see American products all over Iran and they make it through a circuitous route. It is almost always done now without the knowledge or the participation of the manufacturer itself.\" But if Fiorina was unaware of HP products ending up in Iran, it appears to be partially because she wasn't looking or listening. After she took over HP in 1999, the company’s Middle East general manager called Iran \"a big market for Hewlett-Packard printers.” Fiorina herself echoed that assessment about the Middle East region in 2003, though she never specifically cited Iran. The same year, as a reflection of their growing business, HP named Redington Gulf, a subsidiary in the region, their \"Wholesaler of the Year.\" Even after she left the company in 2005, Fiorina maintained that HP was in full compliance of sanctions laws. In August 2010, while running for Senate in California, she defended her company’s dealings with Iran by arguing that its people could use HP ink to publicize the regime’s atrocities. “Isn't it wonderful that Dell PCs and Apple iPhones are in Iran, because this is why we know that a woman has been condemned to be stoned to death because she is accused of adultery,” Fiorina told Lady Globes magazine, an Israeli publication. She added, “We should be encouraging elements of political reform inside Iran, and one of the ways to do that is by selling communication in and out.” With respect to Fiorina's suggestion that \"the S.E.C. investigation proved that neither I nor anyone else in management knew about\" the company's business dealings in Iran, it's not entirely clear what investigation she's discussing. In late November 2008, the Boston Globe first reported that HP's subsidiary, Redington Gulf, was selling products in Iran. On Feb. 10, 2009, the SEC sent a letter to HP which it described as a \"review process\" to \"assist you in your compliance with the applicable disclosure requirements.\" In it, the commission said it was aware of the Globe's report and asked several questions related to business dealings in Iran and other sanctioned countries. On March 12, 2009, HP's Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul T. Porrini, responded. In the letter, he laid out in meticulous detail how its Iran dealings were never direct and, therefore, were legally above board. He estimated that the company did $120 million in business in Iran in fiscal year 2008 just on printers and printer supplies: All known sales of HP’s products into Iran involved sales by Hewlett-Packard Europe B.V., a Dutch subsidiary, through its Meyrin Branch located in Geneva, Switzerland (“The Meyrin Branch”), which is responsible for sales of HP printers and related parts and supplies (e.g., ink and toner) throughout the Middle East and Africa. The products that have been sold by The Meyrin Branch to Redington Gulf and the other distributors were limited to printers and printer supplies that were authorized for redistribution into Iran under the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”) administered by the Department. More specifically, substantially all of the printers authorized for distribution were EAR 99 Products, while two products were classifiable under Export Commodity Classification Number 5A992. Thus, there are no restrictions against the redistribution of these products into Iran under Departmental licensing requirements for that country. In addition, neither the Dutch subsidiary nor The Meyrin Branch is a “United States person” within the meaning of section 560.314 of the Iranian Transaction Regulations as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Thus, the regulations administered by OFAC are not applicable to the sales of products by The Meyrin Branch to Redington Gulf and the other distributors authorized to sell for redistribution into Iran. On March 30, 2009, the SEC responded. The issue of business with Iran never comes up in the letter. There is no formal exoneration, nor is there an indictment. The correspondence ends there. For Fiorina to call this an \"investigation\" -- let alone a thorough investigation -- gives it an imprimatur it almost certainly doesn't deserve. A spokesman for the SEC told The Huffington Post that the agency conducts such inquiries on a routine basis via its annual fiscal year filing website. In fact, when the SEC issued its letter, HP itself called the query part of a \"routine staff review\" of the company's annual filing. The Fiorina presidential campaign did not return multiple requests for comment. As for Fiorina's assertion that HP only discovered the Iran-related transactions three years after she left the company, that too seems unlikely. The company, after all, was known to use subsidiaries to circumvent sanctions law. In a September 2002 congressional hearing, both witnesses and lawmakers talked openly about how HP used a subsidiary in Singapore to send desktop computers to Iraq (itself sanctioned). Then-Rep. Bob Stump (R-Ariz.), who chaired the House Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committee, accused HP of \"disserving our country\" by doing \"an end run around American laws.\" HP’s lobbying activities in Washington during Fiorina’s tenure also suggest that the sanctions issue was at least on the company’s radar. According to a review of Senate records from 1999 to 2004, HP’s in-house lobbyists reported they lobbied Congress and the White House on “unilateral sanctions.” The filings didn't mention Iran specifically. But considering it was the biggest potential business partner being sanctioned, it's highly unlikely that the country wasn't discussed. In February 2005, Fiorina was forced to resign from HP amid wide criticism that she had mismanaged the company. That same month, Marketplace ran a story on efforts by the Bush administration to pressure subsidiaries of HP and Xerox to stop doing business in Iran. In it, reporter Borzou Daraghi quoted a business consultant named Rakki Ansari. The transcript, below, is via LexisNexis. DARAGAHI: Nirdaman Computer Center in Tehran bustles with activity. Here is the heart of Iran's growing IT business. Among the biggest brands are Xerox and Hewlett-Packard. Ansari says American companies can't afford to lose market share here. Mr. ANSARI: If you look at companies like, for instance, Hewlett-Packard or Xerox, Kodak, etc., this market is indeed their largest market in the Middle East. DARAGAHI: With 70 million increasingly affluent residents, Iran is becoming an attractive market. Methi Bothari's shop sells thousands of dollars a day in printers and scanners from Hewlett-Packard. He says HP simply beats the competition. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "The war on pornography has begun. And while it may seem insignificant compared to some of Donald Trump’s plans for his first 100 days in office, it nevertheless represents a very real threat to a sui generis prerogative of every American consumer: the right to enjoy adult films. On July 16, 2016, Trump signed “The Children’s Internet Safety Presidential Pledge,” drafted by the anti-pornography organization Enough is Enough. The eight-page document, which is popular with the Republican Party’s conservative base, purports to shield children from “dangerous [online] content and activity,” but more generally calls for the establishment of “a Presidential Commission to examine the harmful public health impact of Internet pornography on youth, families and the American culture.” By signing the pledge, Trump ― who has appeared in three softcore porn videos and who opened the first casino strip club in Atlantic City in 2013 ― aligned himself with the position that pornography is a public health hazard, an assessment with which most scientists and public health specialists disagree. The Republican National Committee’s current platform includes language similar to that of the Internet Safety Pledge. “Pornography, with its harmful effects, especially on children, has become a public health crisis that is destroying the life of millions,” states the platform, which was ratified at the 2016 GOP convention in Cleveland. “We encourage states to continue to fight this public menace and pledge our commitment to children’s safety and well being.” In keeping with this policy, some Republican-controlled state legislatures have already begun to take action. Utah recently passed a law that labels porn a “crisis” and an “epidemic,” and the governor has requested taxpayer money to combat what he calls the “dangers of pornography.” Virginia is set to debate a similar resolution during the upcoming legislative session, and a South Carolina lawmaker has introduced legislation to block access to pornography on all computers sold in his state. There is considerable concern within the adult film industry that more such laws will follow. Many fear that the Republican-controlled Congress will reclassify pornographic material, which is currently afforded freedom of speech protections, as obscene, and therefore no longer safeguarded by the First Amendment. This approach is consistent with conservatives’ willingness to shape the interpretation of the First Amendment on moralistic grounds. (An example of this is the proposed First Amendment Defense Act, which would allow any American citizen to discriminate against gay couples based on a “religious belief or moral conviction.” Trump has pledged to sign the law if it’s approved by Congress.) The United Kingdom has already taken more drastic steps to limit the filming and distribution of pornographic content. The country’s “Audiovisual Media Services Regulations” ban the production of pornography that contains any sex acts designated “not acceptable” by the British Board of Film Censors. (Some of the prohibited acts include spanking, face-sitting, and female ejaculation.) Additionally, Parliament is considering a bill that would force internet providers to block many adult websites. Israel has also recently taken steps to curtail the online distribution of pornography. These restrictions severely curtail domestic pornography production, and have forced many studios underground, to another country, or out of business entirely. From a performer’s perspective, they dramatically decrease the number of available jobs, leaving many actors without a vital source of income. If organizations like Enough is Enough ― with its charter that seeks “a society free from sexual exploitation” ― have their way, it could signal the domestic industry’s death knell, putting thousands of actors and pornographers out of work. It would also severely restrict consumers’ rights, leaving many without a legal source of online pornography. Currently, two states specifically protect porn production as a First Amendment right (California and New Hampshire), and there is some optimism that Trump’s administration will allow this arrangement to continue. In his November 13 interview on “60 Minutes,” Trump argued that a particular aspect of public health legislation ― abortion rights ― should “go back to the states” should Roe v. Wade ever be overturned. Consistent with that position, it’s possible that he would allow states to determine their own regulations concerning self-declared public health “crises,” including pornography. The pervading sense within the industry, however, is that the incoming administration will be bad for business. For example, at the 2016 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, a panel of porn industry lawyers weighed in on the potential effect of a Republican presidency. The consensus was that the industry “will suffer greatly if a Republican is in the White House” due to increased harassment and intimidation by federal prosecutors, as well as from the application of anti-obscenity laws “that [haven’t been] enforced in a long, long time.” In fact, Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions has already signaled his willingness to reinstate the Justice Department’s shuttered Obscenity Prosecution Task Force. Alana Evans, Vice President of the Adult Performers Actors Guild, agrees with the industry lawyers’ assessment. “While many Americans obviously watch porn and enjoy our form of entertainment, we become a very easy target for the morally concerned citizens of the Republican Party,” Evans said in an interview with Fox News the week after the election. “When we have a Republican-led administration, obscenity cases are more likely to be filed, and our freedom of speech is at risk. By telling the world that adult performers are a public health crisis, we are now put in the direct line of fire for abuse, hate, and discrimination.” Congress could find other ways to restrict the First Amendment rights of performers as well. California’s Proposition 60, which was defeated in November, provides an interesting case study. Its proponents promoted it as a bill to protect the health of industry performers by requiring condom use in porn production. The details of the legislation, however ― which would have allowed private citizens to file suit against porn studios for suspected violations of the law ― could have resulted in the health information and personal details of thousands of actors becoming a matter of public record, opening them up to harassment and intimidation. It would also have taken away performers’ right to choose whether or not to take part in a condomless production. If a similar bill were to be passed at the federal level ― a realistic possibility, considering Prop 60 lost by only 8 percentage points in solidly-liberal California ― it would threaten performers’ rights to privacy and freedom of sexual expression. It would also gut the porn industry, which relies heavily on condomless films (many studios opt for other successful preventative measures like education, PrEP, and frequent testing). Porn studios would be forced out of business, and just as with the sex-phobic FADA-like legislation, performers and pornographers alike could lose their jobs. As the war on pornography heats up, the adult film industry’s best hope might lie in educating the public, using their successful response to Proposition 60 as a model. As recently as September, a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll found that 55 percent of registered California voters supported Prop 60, with 32% opposed. In the months leading up to the election, the No On Prop 60 coalition, despite being outfunded ten-to-one, mounted a wide-ranging online effort to inform voters about the bill’s threat to privacy and free speech, eventually defeating the proposed legislation by eight points. The continuing challenge facing pornographers is to show that porn is neither a menace nor an epidemic, and that anti-pornography legislation threatens the Constitutional rights of performers, producers, and consumers alike. Moreover, they must illustrate that their trade has a positive impact on jobs and the economy, and even that porn consumption has health and public safety benefits. If the industry’s efforts aren’t successful, then the era of American pornography as we know it might very well come to an end.",

        "articles": "Conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt said on Wednesday that the Republican National Committee should ask Donald Trump to withdraw his candidacy or change the convention rules to prevent his formal nomination. “The Republican National Committee needs to step in and step up and talk to him about getting out of the race,” Hewitt said on the Hugh Hewitt Show. The alternative, he said, is a guaranteed victory for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton -- and the loss of Republican control of both houses of Congress. “She’s gonna be president unless Republicans change their nominee,” Hewitt said. “When the dust clears we will have lost the House, we will have lost the Senate, we will have lost governorships.\" Hewitt discussed the prospect of changing the Republican national convention rules to prevent the pledged delegates from voting Trump in on the first ballot. “The Republican National Committee can do one thing: they can change the rules to make the first two ballots advisory,” Hewitt said. He also suggested making the first ballot require a supermajority of votes. “Make the delegates own it. If you are gonna commit suicide and someone is giving you a gun, don’t blame the gun, don’t blame the guy or the gal who gave you the gun -- blame yourself,” he concluded. It is not clear how realistic Hewitt's rule changes, or the prospect of another candidate coming forward to replace Trump, are. Hewitt said he did not have a preferred substitute for Trump, but insisted that the real estate mogul not be the nominee. Trump’s attacks on District Judge Gonzalo Curiel for his Mexican heritage are what drove Hewitt over the edge. Trump has faced increasing criticism from with the Republican party for claiming Curiel had a conflict of interest in presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University. The conservative talk radio host was dissatisfied with Trump’s speech from a teleprompter on Tuesday night in which the candidate expressed regret that his comments about Curiel had been “misconstrued.” \"I have tried for 72 hours to wait for Donald Trump to extricate himself from this but he didn’t do it,\" Hewitt said Wednesday. While Hewitt said he does not consider Trump a racist, he believes the presumptive GOP nominee is so indifferent to political norms that many Americans already think he is. Hewitt was not previously a member of the “#NeverTrump” group of establishment Republicans, but he has used his platform to question Trump’s readiness early in the campaign. In a September interview, Hewitt stumped Trump with detailed foreign policy questions, prompting the real estate mogul to call him a “third-rate radio announcer.” Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio suggested that the justices he nominates to the Supreme Court may roll back marriage equality, in an interview that aired Sunday. The Florida senator cited Martin Luther King's \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" during an interview with Chuck Todd on \"Meet The Press\" and said he disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision that struck down state bans on same-sex marriage. Rubio said that \"no one should ever be compelled to sin by law\" and that a minister should not be compelled to marry a same-sex couple, which is not something that has happened. \"I don't believe any case law is settled law. Any future Supreme Court can change it. And ultimately, I will appoint Supreme Court justices that will interpret the Constitution as originally constructed,\" Rubio said. Rubio dismissed the idea of attempting to pass a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage because, he said, \"I don't think the current Constitution gives the federal government the power to regulate marriage.\" He disagreed with the Supreme Court's ruling that state bans on same-sex marriage discriminate against gays and lesbians. \"It's not about discrimination. It is about the definition of a very specific, traditional, and age-old institution,\" he said. \"If you want to change it, you have a right to petition your state legislature and your elected representatives to do it. What is wrong is that the Supreme Court has found this hidden constitutional right that 200 years of jurisprudence had not discovered and basically overturn the will of voters in Florida, where over 60 percent passed a constitutional amendment that defined marriage in the state constitution as the union of one man and one woman.\" Related on HuffPost: Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Sunday questioned rival Hillary Clinton's temperament for the highest office in the land. In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the Vermont senator clarified his criticism of the former secretary of state last week, in which he said she isn’t “qualified” for the White House. \"The point that I was making, which is absolutely correct, is that if you look at where she is getting the money from Wall Street, another powerful special interest, she voted for the war, she cited Henry Kissinger, in a sense, as a model for her,\" Sanders said. \"I think those issues will tell the American people that in many respects, she may have the experience to be president of the United States. No one can argue that. But in terms of her judgment, something is clearly lacking.\" In a separate interview that aired Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Sanders again took a swipe at Clinton and her qualifications as president. \"I have my doubts about what kind of president she would make,\" he said. The two candidates jockeying for the Democratic presidential nomination both spent the weekend campaigning in New York, which holds its primary contest on April 19.

        "articles": "In a matter of months, Bernie Sanders has earned a substantial lead over Hillary Clinton in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Even though 25 percent of voters still \"have not heard enough\" of the Vermont Senator, and even though he's battling a Clinton campaign estimated to raise $2.5 billion, Sanders has achieved a feat once deemed unthinkable in the world of politics. Despite the fact that on January 19, 2015 he was polling at only 4.1 percent in the 2016 Democratic National Primary, Sanders has now surged to 25.9 percent. In contrast, Clinton's lead according to the HuffPost Pollster interactive chart looks like a failing stock: 60 percent support on May 25, 2015 down to 44.9 percent by mid-September. Polling trajectory shows Sanders and Clinton (email scandal, trustworthiness issues, etc.) going in opposite directions. To some observers, Bernie's ascent in Iowa and New Hampshire correlates to the prevalence of an overly white and liberal population in these states. Surely, a more diverse base of voters will be more favorable to Hillary Clinton. Right? Not necessarily, and there's a problem with this theory, at least in terms of its long-term relevance. It assumes that voters of all backgrounds won't \"evolve\" away from Clinton as fast as the former Secretary of State has \"evolved\" on war, gay marriage (PolitiFact.com gives Clinton a \"Full Flop\" on gay marriage), the Iran Deal, the Trans Pacific-Partnership deal, and other issues. The same white liberals citing Clinton's appeal to \"non-White Democrats\" fail to mention why Hillary Clinton's support among Democratic women continues to erode; something unimaginable just several months ago. The Washington Post explains that, \"71 percent of Democratic-leaning female voters said in July that they expected to vote for Clinton, only 42 percent do now, a drop of 29 percentage points in eight weeks.\" In a mere eight weeks, Clinton's appeal to Democratic women has dropped 29 percentage points. As for Bernie Sanders, MSNBC cites a recent poll indicating \"Sanders has even eked ahead of Clinton among women voters, 42 percent to 38 percent.\" Momentum has shifted away from the Clinton campaign when The Daily Beast writes that, \"In the latest CNN/ORC poll, Clinton's lead with women has vanished (PDF) when she is matched up with neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Jeb Bush.\" Clinton is now only up by less than 3 points over Trump. So what do Clinton's dwindling poll numbers have to do with South Carolina? Or Super Tuesday? Hillary Clinton shouldn't simply expect to win South Carolina, or Southern states on Super Tuesday, simply because at this point in time, poll numbers show her leading Sanders among \"non-white Democrats.\" Below are three reasons why states with high African-American populations and \"non-white Democrats\" will eventually choose Bernie Sanders over Clinton, especially since only one candidate (Sanders) has a comprehensive Racial Justice Platform praised by Black Lives Matter activists. 1. Hillary Clinton emulated the GOP in her utilization of race during the 2008 campaign. South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn even asked Bill Clinton to \"chill out.\" According to a 2008 CNN article titled Prominent black lawmaker scolds Bill Clinton, South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn expressed dismay at the Clinton Campaign's utilization of race in 2008: In the wake of Barack Obama's victory in the South Carolina primary, Clyburn told Clinton to \"chill out\" after the former president made comments that angered some blacks, including Clinton's comparing Obama's blowout win to the Rev. Jesse Jackson taking the state in 1988. \"I was talking then about not angering our voters to the point where they wouldn't show up in November,\" Clyburn said. \"So what I'm saying now is no different than what I said back in January.\" In 2008, Bill Clinton was integral in Hillary's campaign and the former president was \"deployed\" to help with South Carolina. If Clyburn were to \"scold\" the former President in 2016, the media and Democratic voters would question Hillary Clinton's relationship with \"non-white Democrats.\" In addition, Congressman Clyburn is quoted in a New York Times piece titled Black Leader in House Denounces Bill Clinton's Remarks, explaining how the Clintons unfairly injected race into the campaign: Representative James E. Clyburn, an undeclared superdelegate from South Carolina who is the Democratic whip in the House, said that \"black people are incensed over all of this,\" referring to statements that Mr. Clinton had made in the course of the heated race between his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Senator Barack Obama... Rather than focus solely on current poll numbers, observers of the 2016 presidential race should simply look back at 2008. When a leading African-American Congressman says \"black people are incensed over all of this,\" it's apparent that the '08 campaign illustrated a far different political climate than 2016. 2. The Clinton Campaign used a controversial 3 a.m. ad to win Southern votes in 2008, which Harvard Sociologist Orlando Patterson believed contained a \"racist sub-message.\" In a New York Times op-ed titled The Red Phone in Black and White, Harvard Sociologist and author of Slavery and Social Death makes the case that Hillary Clinton utilized racism in order to defeat Obama in Southern states: ON first watching Hillary Clinton's recent \"It's 3 a.m.\" advertisement, I was left with an uneasy feeling that something was not quite right... I have spent my life studying the pictures and symbols of racism and slavery, and when I saw the Clinton ad's central image -- innocent sleeping children and a mother in the middle of the night at risk of mortal danger -- it brought to my mind scenes from the past. I couldn't help but think of D. W. Griffith's \"Birth of a Nation,\" the racist movie epic that helped revive the Ku Klux Klan, with its portrayal of black men lurking in the bushes around white society. In my reading, the ad, in the insidious language of symbolism, says that Mr. Obama is himself the danger, the outsider within... It is significant that the Clinton campaign used its telephone ad in Texas... It is striking, too, that during the same weekend the ad was broadcast, Mrs. Clinton refused to state unambiguously that Mr. Obama is a Christian and has never been a Muslim. Therefore, it seems that Hillary Clinton once emulated a certain GOP candidate in 2016, with her refusal to \"state unambiguously that Mr. Obama is a Christian and has never been a Muslim.\" Most importantly, these are the words of a Harvard sociologist, nationally respected for his work on race and symbolism in American history. 3. Bernie Sanders has a Racial Justice Platform praised by Deray Mckesson while the founder of Black Lives Matter in Boston has called Clinton's racial justice record \"abysmal.\" Those who cite polls pertaining to Bernie Sanders and \"non-white Democrats\" ignore the fact Sanders was one of the few progressives in the 80's to endorse both of Jesse Jackson's presidential runs. They ignore the fact Sanders was active in civil rights for decades and completely ignore the fact that Black Lives Matter is also focused on gay rights; Sanders championed gay rights while Clinton evolved on gay marriage. However, the biggest omission in any analysis on Sanders and \"non-white Democrats\" is reference to his comprehensive Racial Justice Platform: We must pursue policies that transform this country into a nation that affirms the value of its people of color. That starts with addressing the four central types of violence waged against black and brown Americans: physical, political, legal and economic. It is an outrage that in these early years of the 21st century we are seeing intolerable acts of violence being perpetuated by police, and racist terrorism by white supremacists. In contrast, Hillary Clinton waited three weeks to address Michael Brown's death and Ferguson and was grilled by Twitter. Why three weeks? Also, Clinton expressed the belief that laws must change before hearts, but failed to elaborate on the fact that Bill Clinton recently apologized for his 1994 crime bill. Like the viewpoints expressed by Anoa Changa and Pat Downs of Women for Bernie in a recent HuffPost Live segment, African-Americans, Latinos and other demographics of voters will vote based upon the merits of a candidate; not a poll number linked to name recognition. Eventually, an honest comparison between Clinton's actions in 2008 and the record of Bernie Sanders on racial and economic justice will lead to one conclusion. Bernie Sanders will win South Carolina and other Southern states, primarily because he's never utilized race as a means to win an election. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "The conservative commentariat today is grumpy. And perhaps none is grumpier than Red State's Erick Erickson, who's unhappy not only with the Republicans' eight-vote front-runner, Mitt Romney, but with his newly elevated conservative challenger, Rick Santorum. Complaining that Santorum is a \"big government conservative\" in the tradition of George W. Bush, Erickson writes that the former Pennsylvania senator's reputation as a retail politician is vastly overblown. \"His campaign was not successful, it's just all the others sucked so bad,\" he says. Erickson's improbable dream: a renewed effort by one-time Tea Party favorite Rick Perry, who's gone home to Texas and who may be out of the race by the end of the day. Aside from the impossibly thin margin separating Romney and Santorum, there was nothing about the Iowa caucuses that should have surprised anyone. For days it had been clear that Romney, Santorum and Ron Paul would be the three top finishers. And it remains Romney's central dilemma that even though he seems the likely nominee, the conservatives who comprise the base of the Republican Party can't stand him. \"He has all the king's horses and all the king's men supporting him, the print MSM and most segments on Fox News Channel in his favor, yet for the second time in four years, 75 percent of Iowa caucus-goers rejected him,\" writes Kellyanne Conway at National Review. (Conway, a political consultant working for Newt Gingrich, nevertheless reserves her strongest praise for Santorum.) Over at Slate, John Dickerson offers a startling statistic: according to entrance polls, Santorum beat Romney 36 percent to 1 percent among caucus-goers who wanted a true conservative. \"Santorum is now the only Flavor of the Week candidate to actually win anything,\" Dickerson says, \"which makes him a genuine threat to Romney, at least for the moment.\" So what is a conservative to do? Daniel Larison's response is to grouse. Writing at Pat Buchanan's American Conservative, Larison mocks the notion that any of the Republicans who didn't get into the race, like South Dakota senator John Thune or former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, could have stopped the Romney machine. Larison continues: \"It remains true that Romney shouldn't be the nominee, and Republicans will regret nominating him, but it seems extremely unlikely at this stage that anything is going to prevent it from happening.\" At National Review, Jim Geraghty fingers the Ames Straw Poll as a principal source of conservative angst, since it prematurely ended the campaign of someone who might actually have beaten Romney: \"The Hawkeye State killed off the chances of a perfectly good candidate, Tim Pawlenty, in favor of his Minnesota rival Michele Bachmann, only to drop her like seventh-period Spanish by the time the actual caucuses rolled around.\" Yet if Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor, really had that much potential, surely he should have been able to beat Bachmann, who is apparently headed for the exits as I write this. Maybe Pawlenty could have grown if he hadn't been pushed out by a ridiculously early, meaningless test -- or if, despite the Ames result, he'd kept working it, like Santorum, written off by everyone until just a few weeks ago. But in public, Pawlenty came off as being cut from the same cloth as Romney, a bit more conservative perhaps, but even less charismatic, if such a thing is possible. At the Weekly Standard, Fred Barnes predicts that conservatives will now coalesce around Santorum, creating a \"one-on-one race\" that \"is exactly what Romney hoped to avoid at this stage.\" And at the Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan bizarrely (not to be redundant) proclaims that Romney emerges from Iowa a stronger candidate because he succeeded in vanquishing Gingrich, \"a foe big enough that when you beat him it means something.\" The Pollyanna award goes to Ross Douthat of the New York Times, who thinks caucus-goers did themselves proud last night. \"Presented with the weakest presidential field of any major party in a generation,\" he writes, \"they made the best of a bad situation, punching the three most deserving tickets without handing any of them a decisive victory.\" Which sounds like another way of saying -- to echo Pat Caddell and John LeBoutillier on FoxNews.com last night -- that the big winner of the Iowa caucuses was Barack Obama.",

You can drink a little wine or beer, watch movies, enjoy music or sporting activities. Whatever you do, make sure that those activities aren't what your life is about when you should be serving the Lord with fidelity. Do you understand what they did there with Paterno? They made that guy an idol. They made that idiot Sandusky an idol. That's why they got by with that stuff for so long, because they're willing for him to do anything as long as he keeps winning games for them. It's the same problem that they have with that there Catholic Church. The problem is when men get to thinking they're more than just men and others begin to worship them. You're upset about him being a false idol, not because of his involvement in circumstances surrounding child molestation and homosexual acts? Idolatry is idolatry. It doesn't matter what the subject is. Joe Paterno made football the end-all of his existence and let everyone around him talk about him as though he was a god. He clearly concluded that he was a god. He had no business as a living human being letting them put up a stinking false idol of him. They put up a statue of him! What the hell? He must've thought anything he did was OK. But Joe Paterno now knows that there is a Creator and that Joe Paterno is subject to it. What are your thoughts about Newt Gingrich winning the South Carolina primary? He's a liar, thief, and adulterer... that's Newt Gingrich, the so-called \"champion\" of the conservative party. So Newt doesn't have your vote for president. What about the other Christians who are running for the nomination? These people claim to be Christian, New Gingrich and Mitt Romney and some of them others. They aren't pure followers of Jesus Christ. I wouldn't trust [any] of them with a handful of change to go get me some bubble gum. There's nothing of any value in [any] of those human beings. I would rather have Obama... Really? Obama has stood in support of the LGBTQ community. Compared to these people who claim to be Christian, I'd go with Obama. But your organization has referred to Obama as the Antichrist. And it is a prophecy of the Bible that he will lead this nation. The scripture tells you that we won't have anyone of genuine value have the least bit of interest in being a leader in this country, because it's so rotten. Getting back to your organization's attitudes toward homosexuals, is it homosexuality that you take issue with, or sodomy? Are you upset with the idea of gays and lesbians getting married, or are you OK with the concept of civil unions? If you take the words of Christ, and you look at it critically, and don't sarcastically mock it, and then you look at the world, you'll find that this nation and this world [have] degenerated faster in these last two generations than all those preceding have. We're at a dead sprint toward worldwide acceptance of homosexuals and same-sex marriage. You think it's an inevitability that both of these will be accepted? No question about it. It can't be any other way... there's no way things are going the other direction. You see all of this as a part of a prophesy of Revelations. Then why is it that your organization takes the approach that you do? Carrying signs that say \"God Hates Fags\" at a gay pride parade, you clearly aren't trying to convert anybody. Because we are told to preach. It's not because we think it will help. We preach the word. Not your version of the word of God. You do it in a way so that people hear the words. We put it on signs because in this generation, people hear a song and they say they know the song, but what they know is the beat, not the words to the song. Our duty is to get the word out there. When someone hears the message and they come running, it's a delightful thing to behold. It doesn't happen often. We're not advocating for big numbers. That's the beginning and the ending of it. I think I'm still surprised by your sentiment that the social acceptance of homosexuality is inevitable. In the days of Noah they were accepting and giving of marriage. It was the acceptance of homosexual marriage that triggered the Flood. They didn't use that term, but that is the concept. Men marrying men. Women marrying women. Humans marrying animals. How far do you think we are from that in this generation? My point to you is that the nation and the world are rotting beyond repair. This is what is said to occur before the Revelation of Jesus Christ and the return of our King occur. When we discuss sexuality and sex, do you believe that the sin is sodomy, homosexual sex? In Romans 1 it says if you are burning in your lust for another man, it is called \"vile affection.\" If you as a man are neglecting the natural use of a woman, and lusting for another woman, it is considered a \"vile affection.\" I don't care if you're kissing or having anal sex or any other thing you do. It's what's in your heart that matters. Well, Timothy, you're married, so you're saying that it's all right for you to commit sodomy with your wife, but not for men to do so with other men? T.M.I., Reggie. [Laughs.] But rhetorically speaking, the answer is yes.",

        "articles": "Global warming isn't happening, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) argued over the weekend, pointing to the fact that it was snowing in Alaska in May. \"Global warming my gluteus maximus,\" she wrote in a post on her Facebook page, adding a small dose of politics to a picture of her youngest daughter Piper in the snow after graduation. \"This is what 'Grad Blast' means in Alaska! We'll move our graduation b-b-q indoors and watch the mini-blizzard from 'round the fireplace.\" Palin has been a reliable denier of climate science in the past. She's referred to studies supporting climate change models as \"snake oil,\" and as a vice presidential candidate in 2008, she argued that humans haven't influenced changes in climate. In her Facebook argument, Palin confuses weather with climate, a mistake frequently made by climate change deniers. Palin has made this blunder in the past, suggesting that local atmospheric conditions over short periods of time and small areas have bearing on larger trends averaged over long time periods and greater areas. Palin's post comes as a new study shows global temperatures to be heating more slowly than previously thought, but at a rate that could still cause catastrophic damage if not addressed. From a Reuters report on the new research: Extreme global warming is less likely in coming decades after a slowdown in the pace of temperature rises so far this century, an international team of scientists said on Sunday. Warming is still on track, however, to breach a goal set by governments around the world of limiting the increase in temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, unless tough action is taken to limit rising greenhouse gas emissions.

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army announced a new rule on Wednesday clarifying what types of water bodies the government can protect from pollution. The Clean Water Rule is intended to add some clarity to two Supreme Court decisions, from 2001 and 2006, that produced confusion over what waters the EPA can regulate under the Clean Water Act, the federal law governing the regulation of water pollution in the United States. The new measure says the federal government has jurisdiction over tributaries that show physical features of flowing water as well as water that is within a certain proximity to rivers, lake and tributaries. Jo-Ellen Darcy, assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said Wednesday in a call with reporters that for the first time, there are now \"physical, measurable limits\" on covering bodies of water close to those that are protected by the Clean Water Act. Under the new rule, an adjacent body of water is protected if it is within what is known as the 100-year flood plain -- or an area that has a 1 percent chance of flooding each year -- but is not more than 1,500 feet from a waterway covered under the Clean Water Act. The measure will not apply to formations like ditches, where there is not a consistent flow of water. \"The final rule doesn’t create any new permitting requirements for agriculture, maintains all previous exemptions and exclusions, and even adds exclusions for features like artificial lakes and ponds, water-filled depressions from construction, and grass swales -- all to make clear our goal is to stay out of agriculture’s way,\" Darcy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy wrote in a blog post. The new rule will apply to 60 percent of waters in the United States, people familiar with the measure told The New York Times. President Barack Obama said the Clean Water Rule would help make sure polluters are held accountable for their actions. \"One in three Americans now gets drinking water from streams lacking clear protection, and businesses and industries that depend on clean water face uncertainty and delay, which costs our economy every day. Too many of our waters have been left vulnerable to pollution,\" he said in a statement. \"This rule will provide the clarity and certainty businesses and industry need about which waters are protected by the Clean Water Act, and it will ensure polluters who knowingly threaten our waters can be held accountable. \" Many environmental groups were quick to praise the measure. \"This is a historic day that all sportsmen should welcome,\" Whit Fosburgh, president and CEO of Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, said in a statement. \"Nearly 15 years after legal confusion contributed to the first accelerated loss of waterfowl habitat in decades, we finally have a rule in place that will help stem the tide of wetlands loss and definitively restore water quality protections to trout habitat and salmon spawning waters. We want to commend the administration for making this long-anticipated day a reality.\" Navis Bermudez, deputy legislative director for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the new rule would protect Americans' tap water. \"We applaud the administration for standing up for the millions of Americans, more than one-third of the population, whose drinking water quality has been at risk for pollution without this rule,\" Bermudez said in a statement. Since the rule was proposed last spring, it has drawn criticism from congressional Republicans who say it infringes on the rights of private property owners. \"Instead of reaching a reasonable solution, today the EPA has ignored millions of Americans and taken more control over private land in our country. There is bipartisan agreement that Washington bureaucrats have gone beyond their authority and have no business regulating irrigation ditches, isolated ponds and other 'non-navigable' waters as waters of the United States,\" Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said in a statement on Wednesday. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chair of the Senate's Environment And Public Works Committee, criticized how sweeping the rule is. \"Despite their assurances, it appears that EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have failed to keep their promises to Congress and the American people,\" he said. \"In fact, instead of fixing the overreach in the proposed rule, remarkably, EPA has made it even broader.\" The House has also passed legislation to block the rule and the Senate is considering legislation that would require the EPA to change the rule. McCarthy told reporters on Wednesday that the EPA had done extensive public outreach and gotten over 1 million comments on the proposed rule. Critics have questioned whether the EPA's lobbying effort to earn support for the bill went too far. But Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the president, said the rule could actually benefit farmers and other business owners. \"The status quo is rife with unsustainable confusion over what's protected and what's not. This rule provides the certainty that businesses and industry need to keep our economy going and this rule does it without getting in the way of farming, ranchers, foresters, and in fact giving them the potential to benefit from the certainty that this rule provides,\" he told reporters on Wednesday. \"The only people with reason to oppose the rule are polluters who knowingly threaten our clean water.\" The new rule would go into effect 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- In the event of a government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed, not knowing if or when they'd get paid. Their paychecks would ultimately depend upon the benevolence of a fractious Congress, which decides whether to pass legislation retroactively paying workers for their lost time. But at least 535 civil servants in Washington don't have to worry about missed mortgage payments or mounting credit card debt due to a shutdown: the very members of Congress who threaten to grind government to a halt. The salaries of Congress members, like the president, come from a pool of mandatory funds and aren't subject to the whims of lawmakers. If a shutdown happens, their checks keep coming, no matter what. As a report issued this week by the Congressional Research Service puts it, \"Due to their constitutional responsibilities and a permanent appropriation for congressional pay, Members of Congress are not subject to furlough.\" This cruel irony isn't lost on the federal workers who stand to lose pay but for an act of Congress, most of whose members earn $174,000 a year. \"When the government shuts down, employees don't get paid,\" Colleen Kelley, head of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal workers, said Friday. \"No matter how much Congress does not work, it still does get paid.\" Elizabeth Lytle, a 55-year-old Environmental Protection Agency employee from Illinois, said it's unjust that \"blowhards\" on Capitol Hill would continue to get paid while middle-class workers are thrown into uncertainty. Lytle has already taken six unpaid furlough days this year and resorted to tapping her retirement funds for dental work. \"I know that Congress is what they consider essential personnel -- they get paid regardless,\" Lytle said. \"To me, that's not fair. That is not fair at all.\" The GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill last week that made government funding contingent upon defunding the Affordable Care Act. On Friday, after days of showmanship by Obamacare opponents, the Democratic-controlled Senate sent the funding legislation back to the House after stripping the Obamacare provision. It's now up to House leaders whether to force a shutdown. During the last shutdown, in 1995 and 1996, Congress later passed legislation that made workers whole for the days they were furloughed. This time around, union leaders and workers aren't sure Congress will be so merciful in an era of budget squabbles, even if members themselves are guaranteed to get paid. As George Schlaffer, an Internal Revenue Service agent in Baltimore, told HuffPost yesterday, \"The environment we're in now, I'm not so confident they'd want to pay us -- it's not a friendly environment…. My confidence level on us getting those funds are very low.\" Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "WASHINGTON ― County election boards in North Carolina must restore the registrations of voters removed from the polls, U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs ordered on Friday. The order follows an emergency hearing held on Wednesday to address allegations that election officials in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties had removed voters from the rolls due to campaign mailers that were returned as undeliverable. The North Carolina NAACP sued the state on Monday, claiming the purge targeted black voters. The Justice Department submitted a statement of interest in the lawsuit on Monday night supporting the assertion that removing voters from the rolls en masse is a violation of the National Voter Registration Act. Biggs, who during the hearing called the state’s process for removing voters’ names “insane,” said in her ruling that the NC NAACP had proved that names were unfairly removed. “The Court finds that a narrowly tailored injunction is warranted to ensure that eligible voters are not deprived of their right to participate in the upcoming election due to a flawed process engaged in by the State and County Boards, which this Court has determined likely violates the NVRA,” Biggs said in her decision. “Voter enfranchisement cannot be sacrificed when citizens through no fault of their own have been removed from the voter rolls,” she added. Rev. William Barber, the president of the NC NAACP, said the court ruled against “surgical, intention racism.” “Racism is about policy,” Barber said on a call with reporters. “It’s not just about feelings, it’s not just about language. It’s when you use your power ― or attempt to use your power ― to undermine the rights of people and you target it toward African-Americans.” The civil rights group argues that these cancellations are an attempt by the Republican Party to suppress the black vote, which is lower this year than it was in 2012. At least 5,600 registrations have been removed in Cumberland County for varying reasons since 2014, while 790 and 63 were removed in Moore and Beaufort counties, respectively. At least 3,500 voters were removed in the past 90 days, according to Penda Hair, an attorney representing the NAACP. The cancellations could have cost Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton the election, since most of the voters are black and tend to lean Democrat. It’s still unclear whether or not those people will be able to vote on Election Day. State law mandates that voters within any given county can challenge the eligibility of another voter in that county up to 25 days before the election. But the National Voter Registration Act says states can only cancel registrations if a voter provides written notice of a change in address or if a voter does not respond to a notice for two election cycles and fails to vote for two federal election cycles. States also cannot remove voters from the rolls 90 days or less before a federal election. “What they’re doing is race-driven. It’s immoral, illegal and it is unconstitutional. The courts have spoken,” Barber said. “We’ve not seen this kind of intentional suppression since the days of Jim Crow.” Read Biggs’ decision in full: HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

        "articles": "A Nevada Republican arrested for voter fraud in the 2012 election, after claiming she was trying to test the system's integrity, pled guilty and accepted a plea deal Thursday, forcing her to pay almost $2,500 and promise to stay out of trouble. Roxanne Rubin, 56, a casino worker on the Las Vegas Strip, was arrested on Nov. 3, 2012 after trying to vote twice, once at her poling site in Henderson and then at a second site in Las Vegas. The poll workers at the second site said that she had already voted, but Rubin said that she hadn't and insisted on casting a ballot, which the poll workers refused to allow her to do. Rubin said that she was trying to show how easy it would be to commit voter fraud with just a signature. \"This has always been an issue with me. I just feel the system is flawed,\" she told the AP Thursday. \"If we’re showing ID for everything else, why wouldn’t we show our ID in order to vote?” Rubin, like many Republicans, claim that the threat from voter fraud -- which is close to non-existent -- is why voter ID laws need to be in place. But Nevada has no voter ID law -- other than for first-time voters who didn't show ID when they registered to vote -- and she was caught anyway. The prosecutor in the case said he knew of no other voters in Nevada or elsewhere arrested for voter fraud. Democratic Nevada Secretary of State Ross Miller, who has called for a photo ID law, slammed Rubin in a statement. \"If Ms. Rubin was trying to demonstrate how easy it is to commit voter fraud, she clearly failed and proved just the opposite,\" he said. Rubin's deal requires her to pay $2,481 to the state in restitution, complete 100 hours of community service, stay out of trouble and complete an impulse control course.

        "articles": "WASHINGTON – When you get to the White House with such a tiny band of brothers, each and every one seems that much more indispensable. Or so it must seem to President Donald Trump who, just five weeks into his term and two weeks after having to fire his national security adviser, has now watched his closest Cabinet ally neutered in a key role. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Thursday that he was recusing himself from any investigations pertaining to the Trump campaign, following the revelation that he spoke with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice last year, despite having testified under oath during his confirmation hearings that he had no contact with any Russians. “I have now decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States,” Sessions said at a hastily called news conference. The attorney general is the one Cabinet member of any presidential administration with the independent authority to launch investigations that could undo the presidency. In Trump’s case, that danger became plausible even before he took office, with U.S. intelligence agencies reporting that Russia had meddled in the presidential election with the goal of electing Trump. Sessions’ decision to stay out of any of the probes underway now, or to come at some point in the future, means he can no longer shield Trump from the results. For Trump, it was another serious blow in an infant presidency that has racked them up, one after the other, since Inauguration Day. Some have involved missteps by the administration ― the chaos generated by a hastily drawn executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim nations, for example, or Trump’s insistence that there were “millions” of “illegal votes” in the November election But many come back to Russia, and a series of revelations about its intelligence agencies’ role in hurting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and helping Trump by stealing private emails from key Democrats and releasing them through the group Wikileaks over the final weeks of the campaign. Trump has found himself at least one step behind the storyline ― his only response issuing angry tweets about the intelligence community and their leaks. So it was again Thursday. Less than two hours before his attorney general announced he was recusing himself, Trump was visiting an aircraft carrier in Newport News, Virginia. He told reporters he didn’t think Sessions needed to recuse himself, and expressed “total” confidence in him. That response was similar to Trump’s initial defense of his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after it became known that he, too, had spoken to Kislyak. Those conversations took place immediately after former President Barack Obama expelled 35 suspected Russian spies from the country in retaliation for Russia’s election meddling. Trump did nothing for three weeks after learning details about Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak, but then asked for Flynn’s resignation after those details were leaked to the press. For the tight-knit group of early Trump supporters now atop the federal government, it was a major setback, one that seemed to go against a common mythology of how Trump operates. “In the Trump arena, loyalty is very important,” said Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide. “It was a bruising campaign, and the Republican candidate took a lot of shots from inside the Republican tent.” It also meant that an outsider was put in charge of implementing Trump’s foreign policy. Flynn’s replacement as national security adviser, Army Gen. H.R. McMaster, has a reputation for no-nonsense directness. He reportedly has already told the National Security Council and the president himself that the term “radical Islamic terrorism” ― a favorite of Trump and many conservatives ― was counterproductive in the actual battle against terrorists. The sidelining of Sessions may be even tougher for Trump to swallow. The attorney general’s relationship with Trump goes back further than the one he had with Flynn, who endorsed Trump in 2015. In 2014, Trump donated $2,000 to Sessions’ Senate re-election campaign, even though the senator was unopposed. And when Trump began running for president, it was the Alabama Republican who served as a sounding board. Trump decamped to Sessions’ Senate office after attending an anti-Iran nuclear deal rally on Capitol Hill last summer. And he plucked Sessions’ top communications aide, Stephen Miller, to develop policy and write speeches. An aide who worked with Trump said he thought the senator was “tough.” The two bonded both over policy goals and a shared sense of ostracism from the Republican Party writ large. “He was resolute on what he believed in, but wasn’t treated well by the caucus,” said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “And Trump has been saying the same stuff he has been saying on trade and foreign policy and on immigration. So ideologically, they were aligned.” When Sessions formally became the first sitting senator to back Trump in early 2016, he earned a spot in the soon-to-be nominee’s inner circle. His standing to ask for and receive the Cabinet job he wanted was likely cemented in the autumn, in the aftermath of a leaked “Access Hollywood” tape that sent many Republicans fleeing from the top of their ticket. Sessions, a former U.S. attorney and Alabama attorney general, in contrast went so far as to opine that what Trump bragged about on the tape – grabbing a woman by the genitals – would not be sexual assault. “I don’t characterize that as sexual assault. I think that’s a stretch,” Sessions said in October. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another early Trump backer, called Trump’s recorded boasts “completely indefensible” and said he would not even try to do so. Like Sessions, Christie coveted the attorney general job. Unlike Sessions, he didn’t get it. That Sessions ended up at the Justice Department didn’t surprise Hill Republicans. The job was the one he wanted and, as a loyalist, he got his pick. And for Trump, it meant putting someone he could personally trust, and who largely shared his governing philosophy, in a post that is ostensibly independent from the White House. With his administration under increased scrutiny over its connections to Russian officials, Trump will no longer have his trusted ally in that critical post. What that means for his political future depends, to a large extent, on what Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente now does with his responsibilities to oversee the investigation. Regardless, Democrats aren’t done with Sessions. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told The Huffington Post that she still wants the attorney general to explain why he gave members misleading information about his meetings with Russian officials. As for Trump, she said her party will continue to push for calls for an independent prosecutor to look into the Russia ties. “There are people like myself who just won’t let this go,” Klobuchar said. Democrats may be out of power, she conceded, “but we can sure keep on the pressure.” Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

During his months-long job search, he says he logged onto his computer every morning and combed the internet for listings, applying to everything he felt qualified for. In the Buzzfeed video above, he estimates that he sent out between 50 to 100 resumes a day -- which is, in a word, impressive. But Zamora said he wasn't getting any responses, so on a hunch, he decided to drop the \"s\" in his name. José Zamora became Joe Zamora, and a week later, he says his inbox was full. As he explains in the video, \"Joe\" hadn't changed anything on his resume but that one letter. But what Zamora had done, effectively, was whitewash it. Although digital job applications would seem to be the ultimate exercise in colorblind hiring, numerous studies and applicants have found the opposite. Employers consciously or subconsciously discriminate against names that sound black or Latino, as reported by the New York Times. One much-cited study found that applicants with white-sounding names received 50 percent more callbacks than applicants with black-sounding names, a significant disparity. \"I had to drop a letter to get a title,\" Zamora said, later adding, \"Sometimes I don't even think people know or are conscious or aware that they're judging -- even if it's by name -- but I think we all do it all the time.\"",

        "articles": "Already shaping up to be one of the closest races in state history, a last-minute rule change is stirring up the recount to decide who will become Virginia's next attorney general. The Daily Press of Newport News, Va. reported Friday that Republican candidate Mark Obenshain had an unofficial lead of just under 1,300 votes over Democratic challenger Mark Herring. That tally did not include full provisional ballot totals, and as of Saturday, a fresh rule change was complicating matters. According to a report by WTOP radio, the Virginia State Board Of Elections decided Friday to change rules relevant to Fairfax County, banning legal representatives from helping count votes, unless the associated voter was actually present. The board changing the rules is dominated by Republicans. Fairfax County's Electoral Board said Saturday that the modification affects hundreds of voters, and WTOP added that both Secretary Brian Schoeneman and Board Chairman Seth Stark expressed disagreement with the ruling. Provisional ballots are defined by the Virginia Board Of Elections as follows: When the voter’s name is not on the pollbook, the voter believes he is registered in that precinct, and the registrar’s office cannot be contacted to verify that the voter is registered. Note: If a voter chooses to vote a Provisional Ballot because they are at the wrong polling place and are unable or unwilling to go to the correct polling place, their vote will not be counted. When a voter who registered by mail on or after January 1, 2003, and did not mail in a copy of their ID at that time, fails to show one of the federally required forms of ID when voting for the first time in a federal election. When a voter who was sent an absentee ballot has not received or has lost the ballot, and appears at his regular polling place on election day. When the normal voting hours are extended by court order. Back on Thursday, the Washington Post explained how the issue first came to fruition. Pre-provisonal-ballot-tallies from the State Board of Elections website showed Obenshain leading Herring by 777 votes. But the team of Rep. Jerry Connolly (D-Va.), who serves the 11th district, flagged a potential issue in Fairfax County -- where portions also fall under Rep. James Moran (D-Va.) in the 8th District, and Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) in the 10th District. From the Post: According to state numbers, Fairfax reported an unexplainably lower number of absentee ballots cast in the 8th District than in the other two congressional districts. The county keeps track of how many voters request absentee ballots as well as the number who actually turn them in. In the 10th District, 88 percent of voters who requested a ballot actually voted, while 86 percent did so in the 11th District. But in the 8th District, the state board shows that only 50 percent of those who requested ballots — 4,168 out of 8,363 requests — actually cast ballots, a response rate not only lower than the other portions of Fairfax County, but lower than any other congressional district in the state, according to the Connolly campaign. The Fairfax County Electoral Board met Saturday morning and released an official statement later in the day on the provisional ballot totals in question. Final results show that tabulation issues led to an error affecting approximately 3,200 votes, the board said. With Friday's state rule change in place, the board added that final results are expected on Tuesday Nov. 12, with a midnight deadline in place. NBC Washington also notes that any voter who cast a provisional ballot now has to contact or visit their local Board of Election office by then to have their say count.

        "articles": "Donald Trump on Tuesday warned his supporters that if Hillary Clinton is elected president and appoints judges to the Supreme Court, there is nothing anyone can do about it. But then he added that, given the Second Amendment, maybe there is. “If she gets to pick her judges ― nothing you can do, folks,” Trump said with a shrug at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina. “Although, the Second Amendment people. Maybe there is. I don’t know.” What Trump was actually suggesting is not clear. However, Trump’s veterans affairs adviser found himself in hot water last month when he said that Clinton should be shot for treason over her use of a private email server. At least one person attending the rally on Tuesday appeared to sense that Trump’s remark was out of bounds. Guy behind Trump immediately realized what he said was a problem.  Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the candidate was not speaking literally. “It’s called the power of unification ― Second Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power,” Miller said in a statement. “And this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it won’t be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump.” The Clinton campaign was not persuaded. “This is simple: What Trump is saying is dangerous. A person seeking to be the president of the United States should not suggest violence in any way.” On CNN Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) appeared to share that sentiment, although he initially argued that Trump didn’t mean to threaten Clinton. “I don’t believe this is a serious statement,” he said, although he acknowledged that Trump’s statement “may have been awkwardly phrased.” “But even if he was joking, it’s not something you joke about,” host Wolf Blitzer replied. “You absolutely shouldn’t joke about it,” Sessions agreed. “It’s contrary to everything we believe in.” Even if Trump was joking, comments about assassinating the president or presidential candidates are not taken lightly by the Secret Service, whose agents are tasked with protecting politicians’ lives, even at the cost of their own. The Secret Service had no comment on Trump’s remarks, other than referring questions back to the Trump campaign for further clarification. In 2010, Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle drew criticism for saying in a radio interview that citizens could use the right to bear arms to take care of what she called an out-of-control Congress, including her opponent, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). “And you know, I’m hoping that we’re not getting to Second Amendment remedies. I hope the vote will be the cure for the Harry Reid problems,” Angle said. Angle went on to lose to Reid, despite the tea party-fueled Republican wave that year that gave the GOP control of the House and narrowed its margin in the Senate. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that the GOP gained control of the Senate as well as the House in 2010. The story has also been updated with comments from Sen. Jeff Sessions and the Trump and Clinton campaigns. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "President Barack Obama likes to say he’ll use the power of the pen to do whatever he can for American workers. But now that Donald Trump has won the White House, the real estate mogul can use the same pen to undo one of Obama’s most far-reaching reforms: bringing overtime protections to millions of workers. Most hourly workers in the U.S. are automatically entitled to time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week. But because of the way the rules have been written, millions of salaried employees ― like retail store managers and white-collar professionals ― haven’t enjoyed the same rights. That’s given employers an incentive to work those employees longer hours at the same base salary. Earlier this year, the Obama administration overhauled those rules for the first time in years. Under the changes, far more employees who work on salary will be guaranteed overtime when they work extra hours. The administration achieved that by raising what’s known as the “salary threshold.” All workers paid salaries below the threshold are entitled to time-and-a-half pay when they top 40 hours. The previous threshold was just $23,660. The new one is $47,476, or roughly double. That means just about any salaried worker earning less than that is ripe for overtime pay, regardless of their job duties, as of Dec. 1. But all of that is now in limbo after the election. Republicans or the Trump administration could undo the changes ― though it wouldn’t be easy. Faced with higher labor costs, business groups have fought the overtime reforms ever since the White House first floated them. The changes leave businesses with a difficult choice: Either limit eligible workers’ hours to 40, or be ready to start paying a premium on their labor. The Obama administration hopes that dilemma will leave workers with either bigger paychecks or shorter workweeks and a better work-life balance. Employers simply see higher labor costs. By the White House’s estimate, the changes are bringing overtime protections to an additional 4.2 million workers, though some economists anticipate the real number will be even greater. Under the new rules, the Labor Department will update the salary threshold every three years to make sure it keeps pace with inflation and that the share of salaried workers getting overtime pay doesn’t fall. HuffPost readers: Have Obama’s overtime reforms personally affected you? Email us. Please note if you’d be willing to be interviewed. After they were rolled out, business groups sued to block them from going into effect. Tom Perez, the labor secretary, told HuffPost last month that the administration likes its chances in court, where the case is now playing out. But the greater threat now comes from President-elect Trump and the GOP-controlled House and Senate. There are a few ways one of Obama’s signature achievements could be wiped out or neutralized. Republicans could potentially pass a law that kills it. Both chambers have already had their sights on the reforms. The House majority passed a bill last month that would delay it from going into effect, and Senate Republicans have previously passed a motion of disapproval trying to block it. A Democrat in the White House assured that any such bill would be vetoed if it reached the president’s desk. The only thing standing in the way of repeal by Republicans now is a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. A filibuster would leave Republicans relying on the appropriations process to halt the reforms, said Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, a proponent of the overtime changes. Congress could attach a “rider” to a spending bill that prevents the Labor Department from enforcing the overtime rules. In that case, Eisenbrey said, it would fall to businesses to observe the new rules voluntarily, “and businesses would feel compelled to comply.” “But, eventually,” Eisenbrey adds, “a Trump [Labor Department] will issue a new regulation to reverse it.” In other words, if Congress doesn’t block the reform on its own, Trump could write his own reform that undoes Obama’s. That’s one of the inherent limitations of executive action: It can be reversed by a subsequent administration. Trump has made clear that he intends to undermine much of Obama’s legacy, from Obamacare on down to more modest regulations, and the Trump transition team has called for a moratorium on new regulations. This is not a simple route, however. It requires crafting a new rule that must then undergo public comment ― a process that can take months and even years. As Politico reported Monday, there’s also the outside chance that Republicans could scuttle Obama’s reform using the Congressional Review Act, a rarely successful maneuver. That tactic hinges on whether the GOP can tighten up the congressional calendar before the holidays. (Politico has an explainer here.) But if he really wants to reverse Obama’s overtime expansion, the toughest hurdle for Trump might be a political one. He campaigned as a president for the working class. After being told they will have new overtime protections, millions of workers won’t like to hear “just kidding.” Reversing the reforms would undermine Trump’s claims that he’s a president who will raise wages for low- and middle-income workers. “While reducing [the salary threshold] may not be troubling for a lot of Republicans in Congress, it would make Trump’s attempts to reach out to the working class look a little hollow,” said Marcia Goodman, a lawyer at Mayer Brown who handles employment cases. Goodman isn’t convinced that Obama’s overtime reforms will be erased. After all, many companies have already started adjusting to them, thanks to the Dec. 1 deadline. And even with the uncertainty of an incoming administration, she expects employers will act as if the rules are here to stay, at least for the time being. Walmart, for one, already announced that it will be raising its managers’ pay above the threshold to avoid paying overtime ― an announcement that would be hard to walk back. “Don’t hold me to any predictions,” Goodman said. “My own view is that there’s going to be a lot for the Trump administration to address in terms of things they want to do differently. They won’t be so eager to spend a lot of time and effort repealing this rule that has gone into effect. I just think that’s not where the priorities will be.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated hardline drug policy reform opponent Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be attorney general of the United States, a move that sent shockwaves through the marijuana legalization movement on Friday. Marijuana remains illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act, despite the expansion of recreational programs in Colorado, Washington state, Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C. (The District, however, continues to ban sales, unlike the state programs.) Four new states approved legalization on Election Day, and 28 states in total have legalized marijuana for medical purposes. This movement has only been able to press forward because of guidance urging federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations. Under President Barack Obama, the Department of Justice has allowed states to forge their own way on marijuana policy. But that guidance could be reversed when the Trump administration enters the White House. If confirmed, Sessions would sit atop the DOJ, the federal agency that oversees federal prosecutors and enforces federal law on the plant. “Jeff Sessions should scare every regulator, government official, cannabis industry operator, patient and consumer across the country,” said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who writes extensively on marijuana policy. An Attorney General Sessions could reverse the federal guidance allowing state marijuana programs “with the stroke of a pen,” Hudak said. He could also use the FBI to crack down on marijuana operations nationwide and use the Drug Enforcement Agency to enforce federal prohibition outside of the jurisdiction of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court ― the court that ruled in August that a federal rider blocks federal officials from prosecuting state-legal marijuana operators and patients. This rider that the 9th Circuit affirmed must be reapproved each year, and Sessions could order DEA enforcement nationwide if it were allowed to expire. He could also file lawsuits that seek to shut down state and local governments enforcing marijuana reforms and administering regulatory programs. “In all, [he] could undo much of what has become the Obama Doctrine with regard to marijuana policy in the United States,” Hudak said. “That policy reversal is the worst-case scenario for the marijuana industry.” Advocates for drug policy reform have blasted Trump for selecting Sessions. “Donald Trump’s decision heralds a return to the worst days of the drug war,” said Bill Piper, senior director of national affairs at Drug Policy Alliance, a drug policy reform group. “Jeff Sessions is a drug war dinosaur, which is the last thing the nation needs now,” said Ethan Nadelmann, DPA’s executive director. “Those who counted on Donald Trump’s reassurance that marijuana reforms ‘should be a state issue’ will be sorely disappointed.” Trump has said he would respect states’ rights on the issue, but Sessions’ track record of opposing marijuana reform is deeply troubling to people who favor progressive drug laws. During a Senate hearing earlier this year, Sessions spoke out against marijuana and urged the federal government to send the message to the public that “good people don’t smoke marijuana.” He went on to say that “we need grown-ups in Washington to say marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized” and blasted Obama’s stance on the issue. He called the legalization of marijuana “a mistake” last year. In 1986, when Sessions had been nominated to be a federal judge, a former assistant U.S. attorney accused him of saying that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was acceptable until he found out members smoked marijuana. Sessions allegedly made the statement in connection with the prosecution of a Klan member who had hanged a black man. Despite Sessions’ retrograde views on the plant, the trend of state-level legalization reflects a broader cultural shift toward acceptance of marijuana, the most commonly used illicit substance in the United States. National support for the legalization of marijuana has risen dramatically in recent years, reaching historic highs in multiple polls just last month. States like Colorado have established regulated marijuana marketplaces, and successes there have debunked some lawmakers’ and law enforcers’ predictions that such polices would result in disaster. And although many drug policy reformers are disappointed in the Sessions pick, some are holding out hope that they’ll be able persevere should he be confirmed. “While the choice certainly isn’t good news for marijuana reform, I’m still hopeful the new administration will realize that any crackdown against broadly popular laws in a growing number of states would create huge political problems they don’t need and will use lots of political capital they’d be better off spending on issues the new president cares a lot more about,” said Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority. Mason Tvert, communications director for Marijuana Policy Project, said he expects appointees who “serve at the pleasure of the president” to stick the president’s position. “It would certainly be controversial if Sen. Sessions completely defied the president who appointed him,” Tvert said. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who has been at the forefront of efforts to reform marijuana laws at the federal level, called Sessions potentially helming the nation’s justice system “deeply disturbing,” considering his opposition to reform on issues like criminal justice, immigration and marijuana. “I am hopeful that the next administration, regardless of the attorney general’s personal feelings, will respect the 10th Amendment and states’ rights to set their own policy in regards to cannabis,” Blumenauer said, calling on the Senate to reject Sessions’ nomination. But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a leading conservative voice on marijuana policy reform, told The Huffington Post that people shouldn’t be concerned about Sessions interfering with state marijuana policies as long as Trump upholds his campaign promise. “The president of the United States will be making that decision and Trump has publicly stated during the election that he was in favor of letting the states make the decision on this policy,” Rohrabacher said. “Jeff Sessions is a loyal man with integrity, he will do what his boss wants him to do.” He added that Trump likely picked Sessions because of the senator’s views on immigration, not weed. “They have probably never discussed marijuana,” he said. Still, Hudak said Trump’s notorious tendency to waffle on any number of issues is a reason for concern, and noted there is no indication that Sessions would help the marijuana industry. “The only question is how much will he be allowed and to what extent, he will harm the industry,” he said.

        "articles": "Bernie Sanders has made the corrupting role of money in politics a centerpiece of his campaign. He has argued that because campaign contributions by the rich pay for political campaigns, they are able to control the political process. This gives us a political system that is very effective at serving Wall Street and the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. It is much less effective at serving the needs of ordinary people. This has created an interesting dynamic in the race for the Democratic nomination. Secretary Clinton has flipped Sanders' claim around and challenged him to show where she has reversed a position to serve the moneyed interests. This might be a useful campaign tactic, but it misrepresents the way in which money affects campaigns. Undoubtedly there are cases where an individual or industry group promises a large campaign contribution in exchange for a politician's support on a particular issue, but this is almost certainly rare. More typically the support of politicians for moneyed interests is part of a much longer process. It's not just that the politician wants to act to curry the favor of the rich and powerful, more typically they identify with the interests of the rich and powerful so that they don't even see themselves as compromising a principle. Trade policy provides an excellent example. Over the last quarter century, the leadership of both political parties has consistently pushed trade deals that have worked against the interest of a large percentage of U.S. workers. This was not an accidental outcome from these deals, it was by design. Trade deals like NAFTA or most favored nation trade status for China were designed to put manufacturing workers in the United States in direct competition with low-paid workers in the developing world. According to standard trade theory, the predicted outcome of this competition is a loss of jobs in manufacturing and downward pressure, not only on the wages of manufacturing workers, but on the wages of less-educated workers more generally. The wages of other workers would fall since displaced manufacturing workers would be forced to look for jobs in retail and other sectors. The increased supply of workers lowers wages in these other sectors as well. Recent research by some of the country's top labor economists confirms that trade has been a major factor depressing the wages of large numbers of workers. While there were big money beneficiaries of these trade deals, most of the politicians who supported them probably did not need to be bought with campaign contributions. Instead, they likely supported these deals because they thought they were the right thing to do. After all, they mostly associate with people who benefit from these trade deals, either through higher corporate profits or from being able to buy cheaper cars and clothes. Politicians are less likely to associate with the auto workers or textile workers who were losing jobs or retail clerks getting lower pay. In most cases, it probably never even occurred to the politicians voting for the pacts that there was a serious downside. Politicians are people who get elected by making friends and raising money, not by being policy wonks or political philosophers. Being an expert on the issues that Congress or the president addresses is not part of the job description. Furthermore, even if they looked beyond their friends they could find media outlets like the Washington Post touting the virtues of \"free trade.\" Never mind that these deals did nothing to reduce the barriers that protected highly paid professionals like doctors or lawyers or that they actually increased patent protection on drugs and other products. Since these forms of protectionism benefited the wealthy, the deals could still be called \"free trade\" pacts. You can tell the same story on a wide range of issues. The Wall Street bailouts were necessary to prevent a Second Great Depression. The politicians may have no clue why, but this is what their friends told them. The Fed has to raise interest rates, even though that means fewer people will have jobs, because there is some risk of inflation. The list can be extended at considerable length. The people who might challenge these views -- who can point to evidence showing that these views are wrong -- rarely get a chance to push their arguments into political debate, because they are not backed by the millionaires and billionaires. These are people who are ignored or mocked by media outlets like the Washington Post. This is how the wealthy control the political process. The system makes it extremely difficult for those who challenge the policies that serve their interests to ever be heard. That is why it is inspiring to a see candidate like Senator Sanders get enough money and support to be a serious contender for the Democratic nomination, even without big money contributions. When we actually see money being handed over to politicians from the wealthy, whether in the form of large speaking fees or a high-paying job, it is probably best to think of it as analogous to a valentine present. No one loves their spouse or significant other because of a generous valentine gift; rather it is a symbol of ongoing affection. If this sounds strange, let's imagine a slightly different scenario. Suppose Bernie Sanders had spent four years in President Obama's cabinet during which time he did everything he could to try to break up the big banks and have corporate criminals put behind bars. Does anyone believe Goldman Sachs would pay him $250,000 to recount his experiences?",

        "articles": "North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed a bill Monday requiring photo identification at the polls and eliminating a slew of voting measures designed to protect against voter disenfranchisement. The governor, eschewing a more traditional signing ceremony, announced by way of a YouTube video that he had signed House Bill 589. The bill will require voters to show photo identification -- a driver's license, passport, veteran's ID, tribal card -- beginning in the 2016 elections. Student IDs are not an acceptable form of identification. The bill also reduces early voting by a week, eliminates same-day registration, ends pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and a student civics program, kills an annual state-sponsored voter registration drive and lessens the amount of public reporting required for so-called dark money groups, also known as 501(c)(4)s. The bill does provide for a \"free ID\" to be offered at DMVs, though the state estimates that between 203,351 and 318,643 voters registered in North Carolina lack ID, and that providing them with one would cost $834,200 in 2013 and 2014, and $24,100 every two years after that. McCrory said the bill was necessary even if there are very few reported cases of voter fraud. \"Even if the instances of misidentified people casting votes are low, that shouldn’t prevent us from putting this non-burdensome safeguard in place,\" he said in a Raleigh News and Observer op-ed. \"Just because you haven’t been robbed doesn’t mean you shouldn’t lock your doors at night or when you’re away from home.\" Just hours after McCrory's signature, the ACLU of North Carolina and a coalition of other groups filed a lawsuit against the bill, charging that it violates the Constitution's equal protection clause and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The North Carolina NAACP and Advancement Project followed shortly after, filing another lawsuit. The latest bill comes after the Supreme Court struck down the core of the Voting Rights Act, which required Southern states with a history of racial discrimination -- including North Carolina -- to have their laws cleared by the Department of Justice. The Justice Department could still try to invalidate the recent North Carolina law on the grounds that it deliberately discriminates against voters, a much higher standard than merely proving it disproportionately affects minority voters. The bill has the potential to reduce turnout for key Democratic constituencies -- minorities, the elderly and students -- with the slew of new requirements, even beyond the new measures for identification. President Barack Obama narrowly won North Carolina in 2008 but lost it in 2012, and in 2016, the state is likely to be a battleground. The legislation, passed by the Republican-controlled legislature over the objections of Democrats before heading to McCrory's desk, is the latest of a string of conservative legislation signed into law in the state. McCrory has also signed measures introducing new restrictions for abortion clinics (attached to a motorcycle safety bill), expanding concealed-carry permits to bars and restaurants, and cutting unemployment benefits.

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- In the first working week of his last calendar year in office, President Barack Obama defied Congress and pursued long-stalled gun control methods through executive action. Obama gave a speech on his proposals at the White House on Tuesday, where he was joined by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot in the head along with 18 others at a supermarket in Tucson five years ago this week. The president was introduced by Mark Barden, the father of one of the 20 children killed in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Tearing up during his remarks, Obama emphasized a point he's made after the many mass shootings that have occurred during his presidency, saying that America is \"the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency.\" \"Somehow, we become numb to it and we start thinking, 'This is normal,'\" Obama said. \"Instead of thinking about how to solve the problem, this has become one of our most polarized, partisan debates,\" he added. The series of proposals, which the administration first unveiled on Monday, are designed to shore up holes in the federal background check system for gun purchases, devote millions of additional dollars to mental health services, and kick-start so-called smart gun technology. Republicans denounced the proposals before they debuted as inherently unconstitutional, foreshadowing what will likely be a contentious legal battle. \"This is a dangerous level of executive overreach, and the country will not stand for it,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) But Obama has been increasingly unbowed as his time in the White House comes to a close. Aides said few issues have frustrated him more than the inability to forge a legislative consensus around gun control measures, which failed to pass the Senate in the months following the 2012 Newtown shooting, amid fierce opposition from the National Rifle Association. \"The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they cannot hold America hostage. We do not need to accept this carnage as the price of freedom,\" the president said. \"Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,\" he added, in reference to the elementary schoolers who died in Newtown. \"And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.\" The president's executive actions, aides said, were birthed from this sense of frustration. “These are not only recommendations that are well within my legal authority and the executive branch, but they’re also ones that the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners, support me doing,\" Obama told reporters on Monday. Though gun control advocates cheered the executive actions, it wasn't clear how far their impact would reach. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said she did not have an estimate on how many additional gun dealers would have to obtain licenses to sell firearms or how many more background checks would be conducted. She noted that there was no legal basis for the administration to declare that firearms sellers that conduct more than a certain number of sales should qualify as businesses subject to the background check system. Rather, the administration would seek to enhance the process by issuing tighter guidance, rather than tacking on new regulations. The approach allows the administration, as Lynch said, to implement rules more quickly, but also raises questions about why the president waited two-plus years after Newtown to begin the process. Chief among the new guidance is for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to finalize two rules. One would require background checks for people trying to purchase dangerous firearms through a trust, corporation or other legal entity. The other would declare that those who ship firearms notify law enforcement if the weapons are lost or stolen in transit. \"During the first part of 2016, ATF is going to engage in the business of educational initiatives targeting not just gun shows, but flea markets and other places where guns tend to be sold, as well as reaching out to online dealers as well,\" said Lynch. \"They will continue to look at those dealers who sell to prohibited people, which is already ongoing, and we will be looking to see whether or not people once on notice comply with this regulation or whether there are those who seek to still sort of hide in the shadows or hide behind the exceptions and continue to sell firearms without doing what's required. Those cases will be referred to the relevant U.S. attorney's office.\" In addition to adding new layers onto the current background check system, the administration is pushing to streamline the current one. The president is proposing that the FBI hire 230 additional examiners to help process background checks on a 24/7 basis. The current system is overloaded and hampered by outdated technology, aides said, with 63,000 background check requests per day. Currently, 91 percent of background checks are done through the federal system within the three days the law allows. Other components of the president's new proposals include a directive to the departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security to do research into gun safety technology, and a proposal for $500 million in additional funding for increased access to mental health care. The push for smart gun technology appears to be a token gesture, as most experts say demand, not supply, has held back the development of advanced safety features. The mental health funding does not fall under the rubric of an executive action, as it would require an appropriation and, therefore, the support of Congress. And that, in turn, spotlights the limits of the president's refined approach. Put simply, Congress still has a say, either in rejecting requests for funding, or in proactively taking funds away from federal agencies if the executive actions go forward. \"I have formally notified Attorney General Lynch that I will aggressively protect our Second Amendment rights using Congress' power of the purse,” said Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas). \"I notified the attorney general that if the Department of Justice attempted to create new restrictions on our constitutional rights that I would use every tool at my disposal to immediately restrict their access to federal funding.” As for the impending legal theatrics, the administration expressed confidence -- naturally -- that Obama was on solid ground. \"We've looked at this from a number of angles and proposed this guidance in a way that we think is consistent with existing law … as well as consistent with the Second Amendment and wanted to be as careful as we could about that,\" said Lynch.

        "articles": "Hillary Clinton looks strong in South Carolina and many Super Tuesday states, leaving Bernie Sanders with a challenging path to the nomination. Ted Cruz might or might not have a substantial lead in Texas. And opinions on diversity in Hollywood vary by race. This is HuffPollster for Friday, February 26, 2016. HILLARY CLINTON IS IN GOOD SHAPE IN SOUTH CAROLINA - South Carolina holds its Democratic primary on Saturday, and the state looks to be a good one for Hillary Clinton. Polls, which have been sparse or unreliable in other primary states, tell a much clearer story here, showing the former secretary of state beating Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by a margin of at least 18 points. While only one poll has been released since Clinton won last week’s Nevada caucuses, there's nothing to suggest the dynamics of the race have changed. If Clinton doesn’t win in South Carolina on Saturday, it will mean one of two unlikely scenarios: the polls were massively wrong, or there was a huge shift of opinion in the last week. SUPER TUESDAY IS UP NEXT, AND POLLING IS SPORADIC - Voters in twelve states will head to the polls on Tuesday. Georgia, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia have been polled regularly in the last few weeks. There have been very few polls, however, conducted in the rest of the Super Tuesday states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Tennessee and Vermont. That’s 272 Republican delegates and 485 Democratic delegates that hang in the balance with little indication of which candidates they might go to. Texas has been especially heavily polled - Texas is the biggest Super Tuesday prize for both parties -- the Republicans have 155 delegates at stake, and Democrats have 251 up for grabs. The Democratic side isn’t much of a contest, according to the polls. Sanders has made considerable gains in the state, but still trails Clinton by a substantial margin. On the Republican side, a plethora of polls released in the last week show conflicting views of how Sen. Ted Cruz is doing in his home state. Some polls show Cruz up by as much as 15 points, while others show him tied or nearly tied with Donald Trump. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is in third place in all the polls, but his support varies from 8 to 25 percent. The HuffPost Pollster average shows Cruz leading with 34 percent over Trump’s 26 percent, and Rubio trailing behind at 13 percent. Trump would continue to lead in the \"SEC primary\" even if the field winnows to two candidates - John McCormick: \"Donald Trump holds a substantial lead in the southern region where Republican voters have their say on March 1….An online Bloomberg Politics poll shows the billionaire is backed by 37 percent of likely Republican presidential primary voters in the seven states surveyed, while Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas are tied at 20 percent….[T]he poll included the so-called 'SEC Primary' states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia….Trump beats both Rubio and Cruz in one-on-one matchups, with Rubio getting the closest at 48 percent to 44 percent. Trump wins a contest with Cruz, 49 percent to 40 percent. If the race were between only Rubio and Cruz, Rubio wins 45 percent to 40 percent.\" [Bloomberg] Where Sanders needs to win on Super Tuesday - Nate Silver: “Our benchmarks suggest that Sanders ought to win Vermont, Minnesota, Colorado, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Tennessee to be on track for the nomination. Sanders is going to rout Clinton in Vermont, of course; he’s also slightly ahead in Massachusetts polls, although not by as much as our targets say he “should” be. There hasn’t been enough recent polling in Colorado or Minnesota for us to make forecasts of the caucuses there, but we’d probably consider Sanders the favorite in those states also. Sanders trails in polls of Oklahoma (narrowly) and Tennessee (badly), however, when he probably needs to win those states too. Meanwhile, he’s losing states such as Georgia by a wider margin than our benchmarks suggest he can afford. The Democrats’ delegate allocation is quite proportional, so these margins matter; underperforming his targets on Super Tuesday would mean that Sanders would have to make up more ground later on with less time left on the clock.” [538] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

WHITE PEOPLE THINK THINGS ARE GOING JUST FINE IN HOLLYWOOD - Maxwell Strachan: \"Ask a white person if he or she thinks Hollywood has a diversity problem, and you’re likely to get a shrug at best. For all the noise online surrounding #OscarsSoWhite in the lead up to the 88th Academy Awards on Sunday, the truth is that white people on the whole believe the status quo in Hollywood to be perfectly acceptable, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. The survey...found one in five white people believe Hollywood does not provide an adequate number of roles to minorities and should produce more films by and starring them. But for the most part, they are totally cool with how things are going….62 percent of white people are happy with the number of movies by and starring racial minorities and 74 percent believe there to be an adequate amount of work available for them. Fourteen percent would even like to see fewer films by and about non-white people. Black Americans, on the other hand, disagree. Seventy-five percent of black people with an opinion would like Hollywood to produce more movies by and about racial minorities, and 87 percent believe the industry does not provide enough opportunities to racial minorities.\" [HuffPost] FRIDAY'S 'OUTLIERS' - Links to the best of news at the intersection of polling, politics and political data: -Kirby Goidel and Keith Gaddie predict outcomes for each of the Super Tuesday primaries, but say “friends don’t let friends forecast caucuses.” [HuffPost] -D.

        "articles": "Last we checked, ice cream is supposed to melt if it isn't kept chilled. But Walmart's store-brand ice cream sandwiches don't even melt in the sun, according to a report from WCPO Cincinnati. The discovery was made by a local mom, Christie Watson, who noticed that a Great Value ice cream sandwich her son left out on their patio table hadn't fully melted -- even though it had been sitting out for 12 hours on an 80-degree day. Watson left a second ice cream sandwich out overnight with the same results, WCPO reports. \"What am I feeding to my children?\" she asked, appalled. “Ice cream melts based on the ingredients, including cream,\" Walmart spokeswoman Danit Marquardt said in an email. \"Ice cream with more cream will generally melt at a slower rate, which is the case with our Great Value ice cream sandwiches.\" But as Business Insider reports, the product also contains a number of additives: According to Wal-Mart's website, the ice cream sandwiches contain milk, cream, buttermilk, sugar, whey, and corn syrup. It also contains \"1 percent or less of mono-and diglycerides, vanilla extract, guar gum, calcium sulfate, carob bean gum, cellulose gum, carrageenan, artificial flavor, and annatto for color.\" WCPO conducted an experiment of their own, leaving out a third Walmart sandwich alongside a Klondike bar and a pint of Haagen Dazs ice cream. The Haagen Dazs ice cream -- which contains only cream, milk, sugar, eggs and vanilla, and no gums -- melted fastest. The Klondike bar melted, too. \"The Walmart sandwich, though it melted a bit, remained the most solid in appearance, and still looked like a sandwich,\" the station reported. One word: EW.

        "articles": "Everything Bill Clinton said Thursday to defend his 1996 welfare reform law was false. Clinton claimed that he left the program with plenty of money for poor people, suggested that it helped reduce black poverty and that it was only the mean, nasty Republicans from the George W. Bush era who gutted it and hurt the poor. Clinton's distortions of economic history and his own record are so outrageous that -- you will be shocked -- it is difficult to believe he was being honest. Here's what he told protesters at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia: \"They say the welfare reform bill increased poverty. Then why did we have the largest drop in African American poverty in history when I was president? The largest in history. What happened was, all these Republicans got into -- the Supreme Court elected President Bush 5 to 4, then all these Republicans took over state legislatures. We left 'em with enough money to take care of all the poor people who couldn't go to work on welfare. We left 'em with the money they had before the welfare rolls went down 60 percent. The Republicans took it away, and [these protesters are] blaming me.\" This is not true. Poverty dropped during the Clinton years not because of welfare reform, but because the entire American economy was being juiced by a massive stock market bubble. No credible economist even disputes this. The Clinton bubble was fueled by the aggressive financial deregulatory policies of Clinton and his Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. When the stock market bubble burst, millions of people who previously would have received welfare fell into poverty. Welfare reform was an intentional effort to curb financial assistance to poor people, on the grounds that many were simply too lazy to get a job. Clinton turned over a federal program to states, which were effectively allowed to slash welfare funding and impose new work requirements on people who received assistance. Even Republican co-architects of welfare reform concede that the program ended up hurting the poor. \"In a recession, it doesn’t work,\" former GOP staffer Ron Haskins told The Huffington Post in 2012 about the welfare reform bill, which he helped shape. \"Even in 2001, which was a relatively mild recession, we saw a lot of these single mothers leaving the workforce because they just couldn’t find a job and being forced off the welfare rolls.\" Let's be clear about the timeline here. The economy went into recession in March 2001, two months after Clinton left office. This was not because George W. Bush had just moved into the White House. It was because Clinton had left the country with a fundamentally unstable economy and a social safety net that had been weakened by his own bill. This wasn't an accident or an unintended consequence. The whole point of welfare reform was to kick people off the welfare rolls. Clinton had campaigned on it in 1992. \"When I ran for president four years ago, I pledged to end welfare as we know it,\" he said on the day the bill passed. \"I have worked for four years to do just that.\" In 1996, the year Clinton signed the law, the poverty rate was 13.7 percent. At the close of 2014 -- the most recent available annual census data -- it was 14.8 percent. But welfare rolls have declined roughly 70 percent, from a peak of 14.2 million in 1994 to 4.2 million today. Maybe that's because 70 percent of the people on welfare were all lazy moochers. Republicans who continue to applaud Clinton's actions suggest just that. But even Clinton himself didn't make that (ridiculous) argument on Thursday. He instead insisted that the GOP was to blame for unnecessarily cutting off aid to needy people, not he. That's an astonishing claim for a bill that -- again -- was literally designed to kick people off welfare rolls. Clinton turned over the federal government's budgeting authority for welfare to the states and now has the audacity to argue that he couldn't have expected them to slash funding. What, then, was the purpose of handing them budgetary power? Clinton's signing-day rhetoric about \"dependency\" and \"responsibility\" is eerily similar to Paul Ryan's 2012 poverty-shaming language about the social safety net becoming \"a hammock.\" People who receive government assistance are lazy, the argument goes. It has nothing to do with a society that systematically denies them economic opportunities and financial security. At least Paul Ryan has apologized. But hey, it was the '90s, right? Everyone was doing it? Nope! Poverty advocates had pleaded with Clinton, urging him to veto the bill. Peter Edelman, an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, even resigned in protest. His 1997 essay for The Atlantic titled \"The Worst Thing Bill Clinton Has Done\" is a classic. Clinton is fabricating political history for a reason. His wife, then-first lady Hillary Clinton, was an aggressive champion of his welfare reform agenda. She is now running for president at a time when the Democratic Party is undergoing a mass re-evaluation of his presidency. Many of those voters are concluding that Bill Clinton's time in office was an eight-year disaster for progressive ideas. And they want to know whether Hillary Clinton still backs the policies that she and Bill Clinton advanced during the 1990s. When she sends Bill out on the campaign trail and he blatantly misleads his audience to defend his record, it's hard to conclude that Hillary Clinton doesn't still believe in that agenda.

        "articles": "I must say that I am simply baffled by what appears to be the prevailing view in this country, and especially among liberals, that Russia is somehow a threat to the United States. In truth, one of the only redeeming qualities of a Trump presidency that I saw was the possibility that his administration would repair ties with Russia and work with that country in trying to solve issues of mutual concern, particularly in the Middle East. Yet, that is one goal of the new White House which the establishment, both in Washington and in the media, seem hell-bent on preventing. Indeed, I agree with the assessment of a number of commentators, including Dennis Kucinich who is breaking ranks with fellow liberals over this issue, that the U.S. intelligence community’s successful attempt to remove Mike Flynn as National Security Adviser was motivated by the desire to keep the new Cold War going. While I certainly understand it is in the interest of the military-industrial complex, again as Kucinich explains, to continue to vilify Russia in order to justify our already-bloated military spending, I am a bit taken aback at how eager most liberals are to embrace and even stoke this demonization. Given the poor historical knowledge of most Americans, a little refresher on past and current affairs is in order. Russia was our ally in WWII in defeating the Nazis. And, contrary to what most Americans are taught, it was Russia that truly won that war in Europe, having lost over 20 million people to the war and having been responsible for 80 percent of the Allies’ Nazi kills. In addition, while many of us might not like the messenger, Donald Trump was correct when, asked about Putin being a killer, he suggested that the U.S. has been less than innocent in this respect. Indeed, though many were horrified by such a moment of candor by a U.S. President, Trump was engaging in gross understatement. Let me be so bold as to say that, certainly since 1960 and up to the present time, the U.S. has been much more brutal and blood-thirsty than Russia. It is not even a close call here. For example, as Noam Chomsky (no lover of the USSR is he) has explained: Chomsky goes on to detail the millions killed by the U.S. in Indochina during its shameful war on Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and Reagan’s support of apartheid South Africa’s rampage through Southern Africa which resulted in the deaths of 1.5 million people. And, what about today? While many are up in arms about Russia’s annexation of the Crimea (though this was done with the approval of the majority of Crimeans who are happy to be returned to Russia) as well as Russia’s intervention in the war in Syria, these actions pale in comparison to the U.S.’s own intervention in Syria, its recent destruction of Libya, its destruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, its continued support for the Saudi rape of Yemen and the U.S.’s support for the pillaging of The Democratic Republic of the Congo which has cost the lives of around 6 million innocents. It is these U.S. wars, along with the U.S.’s over 800 military bases in more than 70 countries (Russia has bases in only one country (Syria) outside the former Soviet Union) which has led to the U.S. rightly being viewed in a poll of people in 65 countries as by far the greatest threat to world peace. Meanwhile, at the U.S.’s urging, and despite its promises to Russia in return for the Soviet Union relinquishing any hold over Eastern Europe, NATO now has troops up to the Russian border and the U.S. has just sold extended-range missiles to Poland which will surely be pointed at Russia. Russia is not similarly postured along the U.S.’s boundaries, and it is unthinkable that it ever would be. In other words, it is Russia which should be afraid of us, and not the other way around. And, President Trump’s expressed desire to stop antagonizing Russia and to work with it in defeating ISIS in places like Syria should be welcomed as eminently reasonable and indeed necessary to avoid a possible nuclear confrontation. This should also be welcome by an American public whose resources have been drained by the greatest military-spending spree by far on the planet. Certainly, liberals, who at least once stood for peace and for greater social spending, should be in the lead in cheering such overtures instead of drumming up anti-Russian hatred which can only lead to more war and more impoverishment of our society.",

        "articles": "Ku Klux Klan fliers are rattling a city in Washington state, after residents found the anti-Muslim propaganda thrown in their driveways last month. “You can sleep tonight knowing the Klan is awake!” read the front of the fliers, while the back contained Islamophobic hate speech, according to the local NBC affiliate, KHQ-TV. In January, around 65 fliers were discovered on residents' windshields in an apartment complex in Idaho, not far from Millwood. Local authorities said no one group was singled out on those fliers and that suspects could face charges that include placing propaganda on private property charges. Klansmen throwing fliers containing racist language is not a new concept. The practice holds some historical significance and has been a means of terrorizing communities and recruiting new members. Fliers similar to the ones found in Millwood were discovered in Pineville, Louisiana, last month; a Chicago suburb in 2013; St. Louis in 2014 and Rockledge, Florida -- a Latino neighborhood -- last year. “It’s just shocking,” Deanna Cuevas, a longtime resident of Millwood, said of the most recent incident in an interview with KHQ-TV. “This has never happened in our neighborhood.” Cuevas daughter, Teresa, went around the neighborhood trashing each flier she could find. “I did that because I don't want them to feel the same upset and hurt that I felt,” she told KHQ 06. “We don't need children coming and seeing this. This is not okay. It's disgusting.” This isn't the first action the KKK has taken against American Muslims. In 2013, an anti-Muslim terrorism plot led by a reputed Klansman, Glendon Scott Crawford, was stopped by FBI agents. Crawford scouted mosques and Islamic centers as “viable targets” for a weapon he believed could kill Muslims via radiation poisoning, according to CAIR.

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- Gladyes Williamson paced the halls of Congress on Wednesday, armed with a bottle of brown water and clumps of her own hair. She'd traveled with a group from Flint, Michigan, where high lead levels have made the water irritating to the skin and unsafe to drink since 2014. Williamson trekked 14 hours on a packed bus, with no sleep, to remind Washington of what’s happening in a poor, embattled, industrial town nearly 75 miles north of Detroit. \"Not only do we feel like the Republicans hate us, but now that the Democrats don’t care either,\" Williams, 62, told The Huffington Post. \"We just need something tangible to make us believe that politicians care about us. The wards in Flint haven’t seen any of this federal aid, but we do all the tax paying and all the dying.” Williamson said her hands go numb if she doesn’t take her blood pressure pills. She drives 10 miles twice a week to take a shower in Mt. Morris, Michigan, where she can use non-contaminated well water. And she's just one of the thousands of residents whose lives have been adversely impacted by the toxic water. Williamson joined other Flint residents in Washington Wednesday for a congressional hearing on the Environmental Protection Agency's response to the crisis. The contamination has forced the city's majority poor, black residents to bathe in and drink water with lead levels that exceed standards set by the EPA -- a crisis that follows a trend of environmental racism. Flint's water went bad after state officials failed to require treatment to stop it from corroding the city's lead pipes, resulting in a spike in the number of Flint kids with high blood lead levels. Though the city has switched back to a correctly treated water source, city officials can't say when it will be safe to drink again. Multiple city, state and federal officials have lost their jobs in the ongoing fallout over the crisis. Kenneth McCloud, 51, and Tammy Loren, 36, left Flint at 7 p.m. Tuesday. Their four sons were just recently diagnosed with lead poisoning, though the family doctor said the kids have had elevated lead levels for almost two years. Their dog died -- which the family attributes to drinking the bad water. They don't take showers, instead washing themselves with baby wipes. And they certainly don't drink what comes out of the tap. “We’ve explained it to our kids, all they drink now is bottled water,\" McCloud said. “After General Motors packed up and moved out, that’s when poverty struck. Drugs came in and destroyed families,” he added. “The economy went to a crash. Broken homes sprouted up, and families just went to hell. Right now, we’ve been dealt so many blows, this right here was just the lowest of them all.” The couple said they are honest with their sons about the situation, explaining as much as they can. That’s all they can do in a crisis of this magnitude. “We have to stay away from the water. The whole city of Flint is condemned. What else can you do? You just dig up as much resources as possible,” McCloud said. “It’s taken a toll on a lot of us. But we have to adapt and change. But it’s rough, hopefully we get through this.” “It’s to the point where we can’t get ourselves a simple glass of water,” Loren told The Huffington Post. LeaAnn Walters, another Flint resident, testified at the hearing about how the crisis has affected her community. “My home used to be a place of comfort and safety for my family. It used to be what a home should be, a place of peace and protection from the outside world. That was taken from us -- and not just from my family, but from every home and citizen in Flint. Now, my home is known as ground zero,” Walters said. “The people in Flint now stand with the people in D.C. who suffered their own lead crisis a decade ago. We know the horror of poison running through the taps and negligence of the agencies paid to protect us.” Bishop Bernadel Jefferson, who leads the Faith Deliverance Christian Center in Flint, said what is happening in the city is a \"great injustice.\" He said he made the trip to Congress to show that the people of Flint are serious about making sure someone is held accountable for this man-made disaster. Melissa Mays, the founder of Flint-based clean water advocacy group WaterYouFightingFor, brought her three sons to the hearing to learn a vital lesson. “I want them to know that the people responsible for poisoning our family will be held accountable, and that I will do whatever it takes to make sure that all Flint residents have safe, affordable water,” Mays said. Audible chants, raucous cheers and amens occupied a crowded overflow room above the House Oversight Committee's hearing room. A plethora of black, brown and white working families from Michigan beamed while watching politicians fight for their cause. Flint was finally in the House.

        "articles": "If social conservatives in Tennessee get their way, the state will soon become the second in the nation to use the coercive power of the government to force people into bathrooms that violate their very sense of self or risk punishment. Legislation targeting trans students pending in both houses in the state's legislature would require public school and university students to use a bathroom or locker room that matches the sex recorded on their birth certificate. Limited-government it's not. Tennessee legislators, though, aren't original in their bigotry. North Carolina controversially passed an even broader law in March, and at least 30 similar bills have been introduced in a total of 16 states this year alone. Proponents of these discriminatory anti-trans bathroom bills have advanced many arguments for why they are necessary. Most are absurd \"urban legends.\" Some argue these bills are necessary to stop predatory men from dressing up as women, entering the female restroom, and then attacking unsuspecting women. The more restrained say it will stop men from just trying to sneak a peek. Not surprisingly, these are solutions in search of a problem. There is neither evidence that anyone has used the fictional \"transgender defense\" for illegal conduct nor reports of any increase in public safety incidents in any of the hundreds of jurisdictions that have extended legal protections to transgender people. \"...forcing transgender people to use the wrong restroom will have terrible consequences for their very real privacy interests...\" The argument getting the most traction, however, is the idea that compelling trans people to use the bathroom that corresponds to their assigned sex at birth protects the privacy of non-transgender boys and girls and men and women. \"Letting boys into girls' restrooms and changing areas, for example, is an invasion of privacy,\" said Matt Sharp, a lawyer with the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom, in defense of Tennessee's bill. One of the stated purposes of Florida's defeated bill last year was \"to secure privacy ... for all individuals using single-sex public facilities.\" North Carolina legislators this year went so far as to name their anti-trans bathroom bill, the \"Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act.\" As a threshold matter, no one is proposing letting boys into girls' bathrooms. Preying on misinformation about transgender people and calling trans girls boys, advocates for these harmful measures decry the fictitious end of sex-segregated spaces altogether. But even beyond the absurd distortions peddled in state legislatures across the country, these purported privacy justifications for unconstitutional government discrimination aren't remotely persuasive. It does not infringe anyone else's rights to share public space with those who are different. People just don't get naked in the restroom, and we should all just keep our eyes to ourselves, anyway. Like previous efforts to expel people of color, people with disabilities, and others from communal space, these arguments for privacy just mask a fear of difference. And as courts have repeatedly recognized, those who are uncomfortable with sharing such spaces can seek out private spaces for themselves rather than force transgender people to be forever stigmatized and isolated. The privacy argument for these anti-trans bathroom bills falls completely apart when it comes to enforcement. Who exactly will have the authority to verify who is \"male\" or who is \"female\"? Will there be pee police? What will happen to androgynous men and women who don't conform to the police officer or bureaucrat's notion of what \"real\" maleness or femaleness is? For legislators trying to protect privacy, the unintended or ill-considered consequences of these bills seem to undermine their purpose. But let's get real, these bills aren't motivated by privacy concerns -- they're motivated by ignorance, misinformation and fear. Many people, particularly social conservatives, find transgender people, at best, curiosities, and, at worst, less than human, even if the more political hide their disgust with carefully crafted language. The bill's sponsor in Tennessee, Republican Rep. Susan Lynn, called her measure \"very friendly.\" Trans students may mistake her kindness for cruelty because forcing transgender people to use the wrong restroom will have terrible consequences for their very real privacy interests as well as their safety. \"These bills aren't motivated by privacy concerns -- they're motivated by ignorance, misinformation and fear.\" Transgender people, whether people know it or not, are already using the bathrooms they have a right to, and doing so without incident. In fact, hundreds of localities and school districts across the country have created more welcoming environments for all, including transgender people, and mayors and law enforcement leaders and others have said nondiscrimination protections actually make their cities safer. Laws like North Carolina's and bills like Tennessee's, if enacted, mean transgender people will have to make the impossible decision of breaking the law or revealing their private medical information. Not to mention the obvious risk of harassment and violence that comes with forcing transgender women into men's restrooms and transgender men into women's restrooms. The fear of violence is already a daily reality for transgender people, and bills like these could very well make it unsafe for trans people to go out in public if they become law. Sometimes legislators have fantasized about committing such acts of violence. In 2012, Tennessee State Representative Richard Floyd, who introduced his very own anti-trans bathroom bill that year, described just what he'd do if he discovered a transgender woman in the same bathroom or dressing room as his wife or one of his daughters. \"I'd just try to stomp a mudhole in him and then stomp him dry,\" he told The Chattanooga Times Free Press. \"Don't ask me to adjust to their perverted way of thinking and put my family at risk.\" That state lawmakers feel so emboldened to threaten trans people with physical violence is a testament to the hostile and scary world in which trans people live. These proposed laws and the conversations about them contribute to the climate in which almost 50 percent of transgender people attempt suicide in their lives and transgender women of color are increasingly the target of deadly violence at the hands of partners and strangers. It is quite clear whose privacy and very lives are really at risk if state legislatures continue to succumb to anti-trans fear and hatred and give it state sanction.",

        "articles": "Earlier in his campaign, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney took a clear stand on the issue of contraception coverage by stating that he would support legislation that allowed all employers to refuse to cover employees' birth control for moral reasons. But lately, when Romney is pressed on that particular stance, he dodges the question in a way that gives the impression he has reversed his previous position. \"I just know that I don't think bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they have contraceptive care or not,\" Romney said during Tuesday night's debate. \"Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives and the president's statement on my policy is completely and totally wrong.\" Romney's answer subtly changes the subject from insurance coverage of contraception to the more general issue of access to contraception, and it strategically leaves enough wiggle room for his campaign to say that his position has not changed. Romney campaign adviser Kerry Healey did exactly that in an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Wednesday. Romney did \"not in any way\" change his position, Healey said. \"Governor Romney is both a strong supporter of religious freedom and also believes in access to contraception for American women.\" Pressed on the details of the Blunt amendment, which would have allowed employers to refuse to cover birth control on moral grounds and which Romney previously said he would support, Healey changed the subject. \"The question of whether or not we should force someone to give up their religious freedom to provide insurance coverage in some hypothetical situation is not really the point to most women out there,\" she said. \"There are 5.5 million unemployed women in the country.\" What's lost in both Romney's and Healey's answers on the contraception issue is the point that President Barack Obama made Tuesday night, which is that for many women, having birth control fully paid for by their insurance plans is an economic issue. \"In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who's insured, because this is not just a health issue, it's an economic issue for women,\" he said. \"It makes a difference. This is money out of that family's pocket.\" Romney also changed the subject on birth control earlier this month when a reporter for the Des Moines Register asked him if insurers should be required to cover it. \"Well it’s a question as to, should you get a car painted, you know, red or blue,\" he said. \"I mean you can decide which you’d like. People who want to have contraceptive health insurance can choose that in their policy. Those that don’t have -- that choose not to can buy a policy with or without.\" Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that he has a \"tremendous amount of respect\" for Hillary Clinton, but he thinks he could make a better president. He said he would make a decision on whether to run by the end of May and is \"very seriously considering\" it. \"I think it would be an extreme poverty indeed if there weren't more than one person willing to compete for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party,\" he said. \"But this is the way I think it's supposed to work: I believe that if you have the executive experience, the ideas that can serve our nation well and the ability to govern, you should offer your candidacy and then let the people decide.\" O'Malley touted his time as the mayor of Baltimore and then the governor of Maryland, saying he \"guided our state through this recession.\" Clinton has served as a secretary of state, senator and first lady, but not as a mayor or governor. He also referenced his work on same-sex marriage and immigration rights -- two issues he criticized Clinton on last week. \"Doing difficult things like passing marriage equality, passing the Dream Act, doing common sense things that allow new American immigrants to fully participate, pay their taxes, play by the rules and take care of their families,\" O'Malley said, listing his achievements as governor. \"That's the inclusive American that I believe all of us want to move to.\" Clinton shifted her stances on marriage equality and driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants last week, and O'Malley took her to task for it. \"I’m glad Secretary Clinton’s come around to the right positions on these issues,\" he told reporters Thursday at Harvard University, where he was delivering a speech on the economy. \"I believe that we are best as a party when we lead with our principles and not according to the polls.

        "articles": "Here in the United States, we're united by a fundamental principle: we're all created equal and every single American deserves to be treated equally in the eyes of the law. We believe that no matter who you are, if you work hard and play by the rules, you deserve the chance to follow your dreams and pursue your happiness. That's America's promise. That's why, for instance, Americans can't be fired from their jobs just because of the color of their skin or for being Christian or Jewish or a woman or an individual with a disability. That kind of discrimination has no place in our nation. And yet, right now, in 2013, in many states a person can be fired simply for being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. As a result, millions of LGBT Americans go to work every day fearing that, without any warning, they could lose their jobs -- not because of anything they've done, but simply because of who they are. It's offensive. It's wrong. And it needs to stop, because in the United States of America, who you are and who you love should never be a fireable offense. That's why Congress needs to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, also known as ENDA, which would provide strong federal protections against discrimination, making it explicitly illegal to fire someone because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This bill has strong bipartisan support and the support of a vast majority of Americans. It ought to be the law of the land. Americans ought to be judged by one thing only in their workplaces: their ability to get their jobs done. Does it make a difference if the firefighter who rescues you is gay -- or the accountant who does your taxes, or the mechanic who fixes your car? If someone works hard every day, does everything he or she is asked, is responsible and trustworthy and a good colleague, that's all that should matter. Business agrees. The majority of Fortune 500 companies and small businesses already have nondiscrimination policies that protect LGBT employees. These companies know that it's both the right thing to do and makes good economic sense. They want to attract and retain the best workers, and discrimination makes it harder to do that. So too with our nation. If we want to create more jobs and economic growth and keep our country competitive in the global economy, we need everyone working hard, contributing their ideas, and putting their abilities to use doing what they do best. We need to harness the creativity and talents of every American. So I urge the Senate to vote yes on ENDA and the House of Representatives to do the same. Several Republican Senators have already voiced their support, as have a number of Republicans in the House. If more members of Congress step up, we can put an end to this form of discrimination once and for all. Passing ENDA would build on the progress we've made in recent years. We stood up against hate crimes with the Matthew Shepard Act and lifted the entry ban for travelers with HIV. We ended \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" so our brave servicemen and women can serve openly the country they love, no matter who they love. We prohibited discrimination in housing and hospitals that receive federal funding, and we passed the Violence Against Women Act, which includes protections for LGBT Americans. My Administration had stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, and earlier this year the U.S. Supreme Court struck down that discriminatory law. Now we're implementing that ruling, giving married couples access to the federal benefits they were long denied. And across the nation, as more and more states recognize marriage equality, we're seeing loving couples -- some who have been together for decades -- finally join their hands in marriage. America is at a turning point. We're not only becoming more accepting and loving as a people, we're becoming more just as a nation. But we still have a way to go before our laws are equal to our Founding ideals. As I said in my second inaugural address, our nation's journey toward equality isn't complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law, for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. In America of all places, people should be judged on the merits: on the contributions they make in their workplaces and communities, and on what Martin Luther King Jr. called \"the content of their character.\" That's what ENDA helps us do. When Congress passes it, I will sign it into law, and our nation will be fairer and stronger for generations to come.

        "articles": "Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum says he loves Pope Francis, but he wants the pontiff to stop talking about climate change. Santorum, a devout Catholic, told Philadelphia radio host Dom Giordano on Monday that the pope should \"leave science to the scientists.\" His comments come as the pope, who holds a degree as a chemical technician and worked as a chemist before turning to the priesthood, becomes increasingly vocal about climate change. Pope Francis is preparing a groundbreaking encyclical to be released in the coming weeks that's expected to make the case that taking action to fight climate change is a moral and religious imperative. Santorum described himself as a \"huge fan\" of the pope and said he appreciates the pontiff's commitment to family issues, but he wants the church to stay out of science. “The church has gotten it wrong a few times on science, and I think that we probably are better off leaving science to the scientists and focusing on what we're really good at, which is theology and morality,” Santorum said. \"When we get involved with political and controversial scientific theories, I think the church is not as forceful and credible.\" His full comments from \"The Dom Giordano Show\" are included below. The discussion of the pope starts at about the 10-minute mark. (Story continues below audio.) Despite his pleas to the pope, Santorum has a history of rejecting established science. He denies that climate change is man-made and has dismissed global warming as a \"hoax\" despite the fact that 97 percent of peer-reviewed papers on climate science endorse the consensus view that human activity is causing climate change, according to an analysis. In addition, surveys find that 97-98 percent of actively publishing climate scientists agree that \"climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.\" Santorum has also rejected evolution and instead believes in \"intelligent design,” according to Discover magazine. Pope Francis says evolution does not contradict church doctrine. (h/t Raw Story) CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Pope Francis holds a master's degree in chemistry. That is incorrect. While he received a secondary diploma in chemistry, it was not a master's degree. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

During an appearance on Fox News' “The O’Reilly Factor,” Carson said Sanger wrote about eugenics and she “was not enamored of black people.” “I encourage people to go and read about Margaret Sanger and go and read about the beginnings of this organization so that you know what you’re dealing with,” Carson said. When talking about the number of abortions happening in black communities, Carson said, \"I wonder if maybe some people might at some point become concerned about that and ask, 'Why is that happening?'\" Carson has recently made several comments reflecting his opposition to Planned Parenthood. Appearing on Fox News' “Your World with Neil Cavuto” on Wednesday, Carson said, “One of the reasons you find most of their clinics in black neighborhoods is so that you can find ways to control that population.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading causes of death for African-Americans are heart disease, cancer and stroke. Abortions are not listed in the report. \"The CDC would not list abortion at all, because legally the fetus is not considered a life. Therefore, there would be no listed death,\" Carson's campaign said in a statement. Carson also addressed reports that he used aborted fetal tissue for research during his medical career. He dismissed the allegations, saying, “All pathology departments will have a whole array of tissues, from day one of conception until 99 years old. ... Just because they get the fetal tissue does it mean they should throw it out? Of course they don't. That's how science is advanced.\" Watch the video above. ﻿This story has been updated with a comment from Carson's campaign. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "At the end of each month, cable news ratings are released to the public. And, like clockwork, Fox News dominates the top 13 or so programs, far outstripping its competitors. January was ... a little different. To be sure, everything is relative in cable news: Fox News still had nine out of the top 10 programs. It has spent 11 consecutive years as the top-rated cable news channel. Its 6 a.m. show drew almost double the ratings of CNN's top-ranking prime time show. But, as rival MSNBC was quick to point out, and BuzzFeed was quick to trumpet, Fox News had its worst prime time ratings in the coveted 25-54 demographic since August 2001, and its lowest total day ratings since June 2008. To a seasoned watcher of cable news ratings, there were other surprises. Rachel Maddow, for instance, came in 10th, beating \"Studio B\" and the 11 p.m. repeat of \"The O'Reilly Factor.\" In January 2012, she came in 14th. It may not seem like much, but the top of the cable news field has been extremely stable -- and if Maddow were to continue creeping up the list, it would mean a real sea change. Overall, MSNBC -- perhaps powered by liberal euphoria over President Barack Obama's inauguration -- was the only cable news channel to grow its ratings from 2012. This continues a pattern that emerged in 2012: Fox News viewers tuned out en masse from Democratic-themed events, causing the network's ratings to plunge during the Democratic National Convention, the hours immediately following Obama's re-election, and the president's inauguration. MSNBC, meanwhile, benefited from the solidification of its Democratic-friendly lineup, and drew a lion's share of eager liberal viewers. Over on CNN, \"The Situation Room\" led the pack, followed by \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" and Anderson Cooper's show. Below, see the top 30 news programs of 2013.",

It was \"the day that changed everything\" -- Including for Muslims like me. On that day, there was tremendous concern that American non-Muslims, bent on revenge, might target Muslims, burn down our mosques and even lynch us. Fifteen years later, there is plenty of \"lynching\" going on in America. But instead of Muslims getting lynched, politically correct enforcers are \"lynching\" those, like myself, who dare to speak out against radical Islam. Today, in a post-9/11 America, if you utter a word of criticism -- not just about Islam, but even about radical Islam -- if you simply give terrorists credit for the attacks that they loudly and proudly take credit for, or if you even mention some of the radical things that radical Islamists say and believe -- you will be branded as a racist and an Islamophobe. Even I -- a Pakistani-born, practicing Muslim woman -- have been called a racist and an Islamophobe, because I was featured in the Clarion Project film \"By The Numbers -- The Untold Story of Muslim Opinions And Demographics,\" and because I dared to go on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher to have an open, honest conversation about the threat of radical Islam and how it impacts us all. When they called 9/11 \"the day that changed everything,\" little did we know what that change would look like. A sad and worrying legacy of 9/11 is the emergence of a virulent strain of political correctness, and a war on America's free speech rights, waged by the likes of CAIR (the Council on American-Islamic Relations) and the \"Islamophobia industry\" backed by millions of petro dollars. They have weaponized political correctness in a fifteen year war to scare Americans away from using common sense and exercising their right to free speech. They want to stop us from having an honest conversation about radical Islam by calling us racists, bigots and even Nazis. But they would never call radical Islamists those names. That would be Islamophobic. Instead, they paint them as the victims, even while terror attacks continue in America: most recently in San Bernardino and Orlando. Such is the upside-down world we live in, fifteen years after 9/11. As a Muslim woman who left a truly bigoted and intolerant society to exercise my free speech rights in America, I find it morally debilitating to hear the apologists on the regressive left make excuses about the rise of radical Islam -- or worse -- to try to shut down debate. We should not be afraid of debate. We should be afraid of a murderous ideology that inspires people to fly planes into buildings, shoot gays in nightclubs, burn women's faces with acid and behead Christians. And we should recognize the breadth and depth of this radical ideology, which is to destroy the West and its values. Fifteen years after 9/11, let's at least have the courage to have a conversation about radical Islam. Maybe then, we can tackle the issue head on and find ways to defeat it together.",

The bill in question, HB 1390, requires that all physicians who perform abortions in Mississippi have admitting privileges at the local hospital and be board certified in obstetrics and gynecology. While all of the physicians at the one clinic in the state are currently board certified OB-GYNs, only one of them has admitting privileges at a local hospital. The other two physicians can't get privileges because they live out of state, and the owner of the clinic has said it can't operate with only one doctor on staff. Following Bryant's comments on the bill, Perkins took a dig at the Democrats who opposed it. \"Well, the driving factor is profit for many of them,\" he said.

One of the things that always attracted me to the party were the ideals of equality, fighting for the little guy and our openness to differing opinions, but lately I have seen my party take a turn that makes me uncomfortable. Somewhere along the way we stopped fighting for the little guy and became the party of the smug, educated elites who look down on those with less education and deem them unable or unworthy of being able to make personal decisions for their own lives. Over the last few years we have made incredible strides in diversity and inclusion, from the election twice of the nation's first African-American President to the legalization of gay marriage, all things that I have loudly and happily cheered for and felt were a long time in coming. As an African-American professional from humble beginnings, I know firsthand the importance of giving everyone an equal opportunity to access the American Dream. I don't take lightly the opportunities I have been given or the fact that many people, black and white, fought for and sometimes died for me to have these rights. I also have serious concerns about the lack of progress that I have seen for many African-Americans and I blame some of that lack of progress on ineffective liberal policies that are based upon wanting to help those in need, but in many instances end up causing more harm than good. Although many African-Americans have made incredible strides in educational attainment we are still lagging behind in key indicators of success such as net worth, poverty rates, high incarceration rates and, as such, have some of the highest unemployment numbers. In addition we seem to be victims of a disproportionate amount violence. All of these issues are some of the most serious problems we face as a people and our culture of political correctness and liberalism has not only not solved them, but I believe has made them worse. I know many liberals who do incredible work to make the world around them better, and that's not who I am talking about. I'm talking about the cocktail party liberals, the elites, who wear the cloak of liberalism to protect themselves from criticism and so they can keep a clear conscious. My problem with Liberalism is that it's more concerned with policing people's language and thoughts without requiring them to do anything to fix the problem. White liberal college students speak of \"safe spaces\", \"trigger words\", \"micro aggressions\" and \"white privilege\" while not having to do anything or, more importantly, give up anything. They can't even have a conversation with someone who sees the world differently without resorting to calling someone a racist, homophobic, misogynistic, bigot and trying to have them banned from campus, or ruin them and their reputation. They say they feel black peoples' pain because they took a trip to Africa to help the disadvantaged, but are unwilling to go to a black neighborhood in the City in which they live. These same college students will espouse the joys of diversity, but will in the same breath assume you are only on campus because of affirmative action or that all black people grew up in poverty. My personal favorite is declaring with surprise how articulate a black classmate is despite the fact that we are attending the same institution of higher learning as they are. The White Liberal culture encourages talking about diversity and shaming others for their alleged racism, but many times they themselves work in environments that are mostly white. When questioned they'll defensively state that they promote strictly on merit. Black people aren't suggesting that we want someone unqualified to get the position, but I find it telling that they assume that we are not qualified. These same Liberals are quick to be against school choice, while their kids go to private or well-regarded public schools. Leaving poor black children behind in underperforming schools and providing less opportunity to improve their lives is inconsequential to keeping true to their white liberal politics. Many people are quick to espouse the political values of liberalism without having to live with the often harsh reality of those policies. Race, gender, religion and sexual orientation are such difficult discussions to have, and many of us don't get it right, but my problem with some white liberals aren't that they sometimes get it wrong, it's their profound lack of self-awareness coupled with the smugness and self-righteousness that they use to lecture to others. White Liberals have hijacked the conversation about diversity, political correctness and what topics we should be outraged about. When a terrorist attack occurs the media and liberals rightly remind us that it's unfair to judge an entire religion by the actions of a small minority, but I haven't heard similar unequivocal statements made in the media about the African-American community being unfairly judged by the negative actions of a few. The media lectures about intolerance of the Right, but is the first to show the mugshot of a young black suspect while showing the much more positive yearbook photo of a young white suspect. In fact the criminalization of African-Americans, especially men, has been turned into public policy in large part because of our negative portrayal in the media, which is predominantly filled with white liberal voices. For so long, as a Black American, I have been told that the problem is Conservative Republicans. While I'll admit they may have done little to try to improve African-American lives, they also don't promise to every election season like the liberal elites. Instead we have given our loyalty and votes to Democrats, who paternalistically tell us they want to help us, but we have little to show for it since blacks started voting Democrat back in the 1960's. I have never lived in a city as an adult that was run by Conservatives or Republicans, but I live in the biggest poor city in the country, Philadelphia. A city, for decades, run by liberal insiders. The City of Philadelphia is going through a Renaissance thanks to the demand of young White millennials who want to live in vibrant urban areas. We have a thriving higher education community, one of the country's best restaurant scenes and home values and rent prices are going up while 10 year property tax abatements make owning new and renovated homes in the City an attractive financial investment. We are an unapologetically liberal city and you cannot be elected in this City without black voters. But why is it that the black community is not benefiting from this same Renaissance as their white liberal counterparts? While the children of our liberal contemporaries attend expensive private universities, how many black men are getting pulled into the prison system because of stop and frisk searches in these supposedly liberal cities? How many so called white liberals have really fought for those civil rights violations to be ended? My own city has a stop and frisk policy in place (even after promises of stopping it), but is also a sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants. It's ironic that the liberal elites proudly proclaim the inhumanity of deportation which could break up the families of these immigrants, but they are more than happy to justify the need to send black men and women to prison for minor infractions, thus separating the families of American citizens. Where is the outrage for our families? Oh yeah, you can take the African-American vote for granted, so you don't need to do more than pay lip service to our concerns. White liberals posting on Facebook about #blacklivesmatter, white privilege and supremacy are not cleansed of their hypocrisy and elitism because they use the right hash tags. I would urge these same people to get off their iPhones and look around to see the issues they ignore in their own lives. If you're one of these people, before you cry out in offense, ask yourself where you chose to live and how many of your neighbors, that you know, are people of color. Where do your kids go to school? Who are your friends and colleagues? Who do you see next to you while you're in your meeting at work? What have you done to change those inequalities? Have you recommended a black friend for a job at your company, or told them about a house for sale in your neighborhood or recommended a talented black child go to your child's school? Answer these questions honestly and you'll realize that you might not be who you think you are when it comes to racial issues in this country. Are you are part of the group I'm referring to as smug white liberals and you don't even know it? If I were to ask what issues of the Democratic Platform from this Presidential Election would address the issues of the African-American community I'm assuming most liberals would point to criminal justice reform. However, the push for criminal justice reform is coincidentally occurring parallel to the epidemic of opioid abuse in white communities. I would argue this is what is actually driving the policy shift from incarceration to treatment, because the sweeping tragedy of drug abuse that has gripped the black community for the last 30 years, is now affecting the same liberal elites that referred to our family members as predators and criminals rather than addicts deserving of compassion. Suggesting that blacks stop being Democrats or Liberals would be a waste of my time, but what I am suggesting is that we require white liberals to do more than pat us on the head and tell us they know better. Free programs aren't enough, nor are they actually free for African-Americans. How many stories have we heard of African-Americans being excessively fined for minor civil infractions or misdemeanor criminal matters? Those fines are used for running a system that not only doesn't work for our community but many times exposes us to a criminal justice system that causes us to become unemployable or financially decimates our families. Remember Eric Garner, the man in New York that died from a chokehold for selling loose cigarettes? That enforcement order was created during Democratic Mayor and Democratic Governor's administrations. I'm sure that they believed that the revenue generated by the cigarette tax would fund important programs for the poor, but there was a real cost to African-Americans in the community who were fined, harassed, incarcerated and, in the case of Eric Garner, died over a tax. Let's not forget the 10 year tax abatement that brings wealthy white liberals to the City, but increases the taxes for many poor home owners of color making it prohibitively expensive to stay in neighborhoods where they may have lived for decades. We need results not more empty promises. We need to take a serious look at the policies that will truly make it possible for blacks to attain better job opportunities, stronger families, safer neighborhoods and better schools. If we continue to align ourselves with liberal elites that lecture about the evils of discrimination, but don't want to see us as their boss (or even colleague), competing for opportunities against their children, or as their neighbors, then we need to look at what other groups can offer the African-American community in terms of opportunities or effective policies that will allow us to prosper. If the only conversation we're requiring them to have about us is about keeping us out of prison or getting less jail time, then we are so far behind that I am not sure that we will ever catch up. We must take control of the narratives about our issues because white liberals are talking about things that may make you feel better, but are not improving the quality of life for your family or our community. Anyone that would tell your children to do something that they wouldn't tell their own child is not your ally. While these conversations, driven by the elites, are seemingly sympathetic, they will only keep our children at the bottom, and uncompetitive to their own children. The truth is that Liberalism is about making elites feel better about themselves and their lives without requiring the underlying action of significantly improving the lives of African-Americans. Hillary Clinton rightly says that it's not about what you say about problem, but you should be judged by what you are doing to solve the problem. In this election, let's take her at her word and take a deeper look at what Liberalism is really doing for us.",

        "articles": "WASHINGTON — The day after the election in 2016, Nancy Goldstein, a 55-year-old Brooklyn writer and academic who has never been to Israel, opened up her computer and began the process of applying for Israeli citizenship. In Washington, D.C., 49-year-old entrepreneur David Bennahum began the complex process of moving his family and startup business to Montreal, finally establishing all four of them and the company there in July.The one thing they had in common: They are both Jewish. And both had looked at the campaign of Donald J. Trump and decided they would be safer as Jews and as liberals if they had an exit strategy from America. The question of living as a Jew in America under Trump has provoked varying degrees of anxiety in the year since he tweeted out an anti-Semitic meme about Hillary Clinton — the infamous Star of David tweet — and then sought to defend it as a “Sheriff’s Star.” That’s when I first started to hear the half-panicked, half-joking conversations about exit strategies if Trump won and considerations about where to go if America were ever to become unsafe. A friend whose grandparents had fled Germany talked to her mother about going back there. A half-Jewish, half-Australian friend decided to pursue — and ultimately secured — dual citizenship and an Australian passport. Contemplating worst-case scenarios is something practically encoded in the Jewish DNA, a legacy of 2,000 years of persecution culminating in the slaughter of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust less than a century ago. And given that most American Jews are Democrats and political progressives, the sense of foreboding that Trump has provoked has been compounded by his actions and rhetoric against other groups Jews have stood in solidarity with in America: refugees, immigrants, religious minorities, people fighting for civil rights. Now the events in Charlottesville, Va., have triggered more difficult historical memories, and forced some Jews to freshly confront troubling questions about their personal and community safety. And it’s forcing many of them to weigh how much they trust America against how much they trust their own fears about where their country is going under Trump. “What happened last Shabbat was terrifying. Seeing Nazis marching with torches on American soil touches our deepest vulnerability, our collective trauma. Hearing the leader of our country refuse to take a stand against them reminds us of so many closed borders, so many who turned away when our parents and grandparents were running for their lives,” Rabbi Rachel Timoner of Congregation Beth Elohim wrote in a letter to her Brooklyn, N.Y., congregation urging them to not feel alone in their fears, and to stand with in the wake of the Charlottesville car attack. Three days after Charlottesville, Eran Greenberg, a 42-year-old doctor who works in Northern Virginia, had a different response: He retook possession of the gun he’d bought years ago but kept stored outside his home. “Seeing this up three blocks from my house set me off,” he said, sharing a photo of an Identity Evropa poster proclaiming “Our destiny is ours” on a lamppost in Old Town, Alexandria, Va. Identity Evropa is an American white supremacist group, and the offices of “alt-right” leader Richard Spencer are in Alexandria, making the city a hub of white nationalist activity. “Every Jewish person I know feels pretty much exactly the same way. And it’s this sort of sense of dread because we don’t know when we’re being unnecessarily frightened and when to take it seriously. It’s the question that’s been asked by Jews around the world: When is it time to go? When is it time to leave? And when is it too late?” asked Kaili Joy Gray, 39, a D.C.-based senior editor at Share Blue media, who unspooled a Twitter thread asking similar questions after Charlottesville. “Most of the time for American Jews, now, in 2017, we feel pretty safe. We don’t necessarily stand out. We don’t necessarily get a lot of attention, and we are used to thinking about the horrible things that have happened throughout our history as historical things. And in the last few days we’ve seen Nazis, saluting Trump and saying ‘Heil Trump’ and it stirs anger and frustration and fear and makes you realize it’s not history, it’s right now and this movement — this hatred — is being fueled by the president of the United States and that’s terrifying,” she said. D.C.-area residents, like New Yorkers, have since Sept. 11 been urged to develop evacuation plans in the event of a terrorist attack, and many work in offices that continue to hand out emergency kits with items such as whistles and face masks. The fact that so many Jews live in communities that have already been on high alert or targeted by al-Qaeda doubtless contributes to the conversations about exit strategies and escape routes, along with the political environment and recent worries about a conflict with a nuclear North Korea. But mainly it’s Trump. “My husband and I have talked about [having to leave] only since Trump took office. In the last half-year, we’ve said, you know it’s a possibility,” said Maia, 40, a business development specialist in Washington, D.C., who asked that I not to use her last name or place of employment. “Thank God there’s an Israel and we have property there,” she added, noting that that would be the couple’s destination if they ever felt truly threatened in America. Israel, of course, routinely comes under rocket fire from armed militias and has been subjected to waves of terrorist attacks that dwarf anything seen in America. “Personally, it’s not as threatening to me as 9/11,” Maia said of the neo-Nazi marchers. “That felt more like an assault. This feels like a lot of empty rhetoric without a lot of planning. I hope that this can bring us together like 9/11.” Bennahum’s reasons for moving to Canada were more complex than just the attentiveness to politics that comes with being a son of a Jew who survived World War II in Nazi-occupied Romania. There were serious business incentives, such as not having to pay healthcare costs for his employees, thanks to Canada’s single-payer system. And he speaks French. “What opened the deal was the election and then what closed it was the incentives offered by the federal government and the Quebec government to companies like mine to relocate engineers and resources,” he said. But he also has a dark theory about what’s happening in America, where he sees a democracy that has been under assault since the 1994 Gingrich revolution. The “deeply bad” Bush v. Gore decision, the “nihilistic Republican Congress from 2010 forward,” and Clinton’s loss of the White House despite winning the popular vote are, along with Gingrich’s move to polarize Congress, “four sequential fundamental battering rams to the social norms of the republic” that have helped weaken the American project, he said. “I put the chances at one in three that the republic is over. Full stop. That the grand American experiment, the world’s oldest continuous democracy — 240 years young — I put it at a one in three shot that it’s out. If Republicans hold Congress in 2018, it goes to one in two. And I think if Trump is reelected with a Republican Congress in 2020, it’s one in one. It is over. … It’s all going to be decided in the next, what, 41 months,” he said. “If I’m wrong, great, then I’ll come back. It’s not complicated. If I’m right, I’m really sorry.” “I think everyone needs an exit strategy. It doesn’t mean you have to exit right away. But if you have not executed on your path out, you’re naive. If your plan is just to wait and see, that’s not a good story. We know how that ends. That ends in tears, at best,” he said. Not everyone is so apocalyptic about the future for Jews in America. “Give me a country and I will tell you we are a lot better off than that country in the Jewish community,” said Ira Forman, the former special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism at the U.S. State Department. “I’d much prefer being a Jew in the United States in terms of anti-Semitic threats than even Canada, France or the U.K.” “Anti-Semitism in the U.S. has been almost qualitatively different from what we see overseas,” he said. “We are not in the ’30s, and we are not the German Jewish community in the 1930s. It is sure as heck not that. But we can’t be complacent.” Fighting anti-Semitism is hard, and some of the most obvious approaches, such as taking down Twitter and Facebook accounts of white supremacists, don’t do as much to solve the problem as people might hope. What works best, what is most powerful, Forman said, is the power of social opprobrium. “One thing we know a fair amount about is civil society speaking out. Heads of churches, civic leaders, business leaders, even common people — when people speak out and the haters pay a social cost, that’s a very powerful tool. We need a lot of folks to speak out. Not just political leaders. We need civil society to rise up,” he said. “It’s got to be consistent, it’s got to be long term and it’s got to be a lot of people.” The Jews I’ve spoken with are less afraid that the U.S. government will turn on them with the organized ferocity of the Third Reich than that independent armed bands of anti-Semites and white supremacists will gain enough strength and engage in enough acts of terrorism, harassment and negative propaganda to bring what has been the golden age of America for Jews to an end. Fear of civilian anti-Semitism and mob violence, and not just official state actions, is deeply grounded in the Jewish experience of non-state actors being the vanguard of anti-Semitic violence when egged on by government officials.“The ‘very fine people’ comment sent shivers down my spine, because the Latvian man who led the murder of my grandfather’s family and the rest of the inhabitants of his tiny village ended up immigrating to Canada after World War II. He settled in Toronto, where I grew up, and in fact lived in the same suburb as I did, not far from my house,” said Lavi Soloway, 50, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who in 2004 became a U.S. citizen. “Why am I afraid? I know that ordinary people, patriotic nationalists, people with hatred for the other, specifically hatred for Jews, can be driven to insane acts of violence.” “Those Charlottesville marchers are a danger to us all. And I cannot simply write them off as a small band of loonies, not with the president giving them succor,” he said. And then there is the deep pain caused by watching elders taking note of the new anti-Semitism in their waning days. “When the Nazis invaded [my grandmother’s] hometown of Lodz, Poland, she was 18 years old. She watched as her parents and all the members of her family were killed. She survived three years in the Lodz Ghetto and internment in Auschwitz, Hainichen and Theresienstadt concentration camps,” said Soloway. “She has lived a remarkable life, and thus it is so monstrously unjust that after having succeeded to rebuild and raise a family, and see her grandchildren grow to adulthood and start families of their own, she is now confronted with the rise of racist nationalism and anti-Semitism, not just in the U.S. but certainly in Europe as well.” Children too have been frightened in a way that hurts. “Yesterday my 9 year-old saw some footage from Charlottesville. Then she asked me if there would be a second Holocaust,” tweeted writer Peter Beinart on Friday. Younger Jews in general are having trouble reconciling the idea of Nazi marches in America with how they think about this country, said Michael Uram, executive director and campus rabbi at the University of Pennsylvania, Trump’s alma mater. A lot of students, particularly those at large universities in major cities who grew up on the coasts, “think of anti-Semitism as something that existed for their grandparents and parents.” To confront it as something they too might have to fight is jarring. “There was an incredible sense of shock and disorientation that all this bubbled up,” he said. “They have not felt marginalized or prohibited from doing anything — and yet the story of anti-Semitism is coming up. It’s very hard for students on campus to integrate, to understand how it fits into their Jewish story.” Some scoff at the idea that Americans would ever turn against Jews in a threatening way. Jewish Americans are, by and large, well assimilated, educated and successful. Trump’s own daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married Jared Kushner, one of the president’s most trusted advisers. The public views Jews more warmly than any other religious faith, according to a Pew Research Center study from 2014, although the numbers are higher among older Americans than those under 30. As well, “Jews receive their most positive ratings from whites,” according to Pew, demonstrating that there is a deep well of good faith toward Jews among the population from which white supremacists seek to recruit. The widespread public condemnations of the marchers in Charlottesville and the rejection of the president by business, arts and charity leaders since his widely panned remarks Tuesday has been heartening to opponents of white nationalism. In Boston on Saturday, thousands of anti-white-supremacy marchers — the official police estimate was 40,000 — turned out to counter a “Free Speech” rally by Trump supporters and white supremacists that drew fewer than 100 attendees. But fear is visceral, not rational. “Rationally, the reaction to Charlottesville by everyone in America who isn’t Trump is reassuring — it suggests there is no significant constituency for anti-Semitism in America. Irrationally, I’ve been thinking about the mechanics of leaving the country and even of last-ditch resistance, ever since last November,” said Adam Kirsch, a poet and literary critic in New York City. Jews make up only 2.2 percent of the U.S. population, so even if only a tiny minority of white Christians choose to agitate against them, it could be felt profoundly given the broader demographics of the country. The Ku Klux Klan at its peak in the 1920s had a membership that constituted roughly 4 percent of Americans and was able to wield terror against African-Americans throughout the South. The increasingly bitter polarization of U.S. politics is also a troublesome turn for Jews, in that they overwhelming vote for only one political party: The Democrats, now out of power at every level of national government. Of all the measured religions, Jews voted for Clinton at the highest percent, casting nearly three-quarters of their ballots for her and 24 percent for Trump, according to Pew . By comparison, only 16 percent of white, born-again Evangelical Christians voted for Clinton. “The Jewish community has learned to live with the fact that one of the parties nominated — and White House came to be inhabited by — someone whose most fervent supporters are white nationalists racists and anti-Semites and those are the supporters he takes care not to alienate,” said Yehudah Mirsky, associate professor of the practice of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University in Boston. “Does [Charlottesville] make Jews feel more threatened in America? It can’t not,” he said. That said, he added: “I don’t think American Jews have reason to be terrified. American society and American democracy are strong and healthy in all sorts of ways, but there are disturbing currents around, and president of the United States takes every opportunity to fan the flames.” “Jews with historical memories always have their passports up to date, that’s just a matter of course,” Mirsky said. But “this isn’t France, where a Jew can’t walk around with his yarmulke on his head without fear of being beaten up.” “Frankly one reason we don’t have that in America, is that as far as I can tell American Muslims are not anti-Semites,” he added. Indeed Benjamin Sax, 42, a scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Maryland, said his group has found that Jews, with their refugee experiences, and Muslims, currently fighting Trump’s ban on refugees and Muslims, have been coming together since the election to build bridges around opposition to the president. Rather than fueling anti-Semitism, he sees Muslims in America making common cause with Jews. “One silver lining is that my organization has responded to numerous requests, mostly by Jewish and Muslim women, looking to connect, so that’s actually been a pretty amazing community. And allies who wouldn’t normally align are finding their ways to our organization.” “I live in Baltimore so I don’t feel at all under siege,” says Sax, but he too has felt compelled to consider over the past year to consider where he would go if he couldn’t stay in America. “I wouldn’t move to Israel, I lived there for five years. I thought about Germany. And I know that there’s a strange irony in that, but my wife grew up in Europe.” Denmark, which they visited on a recent trip, also looked attractive. “It’s very easy to get swept away in a European culture and ignore the demons that are in their closets,” though, he noted. There is also the option that many Jews are taking for now, to stay and fight. Build the self-styled resistance movement. Protest, organize and trust in America. “As the white Jewish mother of a black teen, I deal with my ‘Jewish anxiety and safety concerns’ by teaching marshaling for demonstrations and nonviolent civil disobedience and by helping to organize fierce, disruptive but peaceful protests of varying sizes. Building resistant, defiant, loud community is my jam,” Alexis Danzig, a member of the anti-Trump group Rise and Resist said, quoting from my query. “And then I lie awake at night wondering how to get my kid out of the country.” Seven months into Trump’s first term, Goldstein has completed all the paperwork and been approved for Israeli citizenship upon completing one week of residency there, but it’s a step so fraught, she is still hesitant to take it. The president’s reaction to Charlottesville wasn’t a wake-up call for her but an example of what she feared and expected from his presidency. What she really wants, though, is to feel safe here again, not to leave America. This story was originally published on Yahoo News. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article attributed authorship of the essay to Joe Wurzelbacher. A portion of the essay was posted to Wurzelbacher's website from The Black Sphere, where it originated. To make his case, Wurzelbacher re-posted an excerpt of a blog by conservative blogger Kevin Jackson on his own website, Joe For America, on Oct. 10. In the post, Jackson writes, \"Wanting a white Republican president doesn't make you racist, it just makes you American.\" The post was not attributed to Jackson, and Wurzelbacher only included a link to Jackson's original post at the bottom of the page. Jackson, who is black, referred to the time prior to President Barack Obama's election to the presidency as the \"pre-black president era,\" saying at that time, criticizing the president \"meant that you didn't like his policies.\" \"The election of a recognized black president was not supposed to change anything. In fact, it was supposed to (1) ease any perceived racial tensions, and (2) allow the government to focus on legislating without race. So America would be more free than ever to discuss the issues,\" Jackson wrote. \"Not the case. And that is why having a white Republican president is best for the country.\" The essay goes on to question why no one has accused black people of racism \"when blacks had sanity and disagreed with the policies of racist white Democrat presidents.\" Jackson also brings Mexicans into his argument, saying \"many deranged Mexicans\" who fight for immigration rights \"are not called racist.\" \"Mexicans disagreed with most white Republican presidents over America’s immigration policy. Many deranged Mexicans believe we should open the country up to them, some saying that much of America belongs to Mexico anyway. They are not called racists,\" Jackson wrote. Wurzelbacher has made inflammatory comments about immigration before. In August 2012, when he was running for office, he suggested America \"put a damn fence on the border going to Mexico and start shooting.\" Read the excerpt on Wurzelbacher's blog here.

        "articles": "Anti-immigration conservatives flipped out over news that President Donald Trump made a deal with Democratic leaders on immigration. Following dinner at the White House on Wednesday night, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced that Trump had agreed to legislation that would save the country’s 800,000 Dreamers from deportation. The U.S.-Mexico border wall― a central Trump campaign promise― was not part of this deal, they said. The meeting was the result of widespread backlash over the administration’s decision earlier this month to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program created during former president Barack Obama’s administration that protects undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Trump on Thursday denied that the group had reached a firm agreement, and both White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Schumer’s communications director have said the president would continue to push for the wall in other agreements. Conservative pundits still cried betrayal, though. Far-right news outlet Breitbart News ran with the headline, “Amnesty Don.” “President Trump signaled a full-fledged cave on the issue of giving amnesty to nearly 800,000 illegal aliens currently protected by an Obama-created executive immigration program,” Breitbart reporter John Binder wrote. Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity, who blamed Republican leaders, said that “it’s over” for the president if he abandons his hardline immigration stance. Weak R's have betrayed voters. @POTUS needs to stay the course and keep his promises or it's over! Pelosi and Schumer can never be trusted.  And if @POTUS doesn't keep that promise, and goes for amnesty, it will be the political equivalent or \"read my lips, no new taxes\"  Rep. Steve King (Iowa), one of Congress’ most vocal immigration opponents, warned that Trump supporters would be “disillusioned beyond repair” if reports of the deal were true. @RealDonaldTrump If AP is correct, Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible.  When Trump tweeted on Thursday that Dreamers were in the U.S. “through no fault of their own,” conservative firebrand Ann Coulter wondered, “who DOESN’T want Trump impeached?” At this point, who DOESN'T want Trump impeached?  Fox Business host Lou Dobbs called the reported deal a “huge loss,” while former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh (R) said that Trump “screwed his base.” No wall.DACA enshrined.Trump didn't make a deal w Chuck and Nancy. Trump got screwed by Chuck and Nancy.Trump just screwed his base. Not all conservatives are on the same page, however. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake (R), usually an outspoken Trump critic, offered the president “kudos.” Kudos to @POTUS for pursuing agreement that will protect #Dreamers from deportation  In an interview with The Associated Press published on Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) maintained his position that the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Dreamers was “not in our nation’s interest.” Ryan’s comments reflect what is largely a consensus among prominent establishment Republicans, including Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, that deporting Dreamers is a bad idea. Even former White House strategist Steve Bannon, another immigration hardliner, said he disagreed with the president’s decision to rescind DACA.

        "articles": "In a somewhat surprising turn of events, The Economist in its May 23rd edition, published a piece with no name attached, where it labeled the idea of a basic income for all as \"basically unaffordable.\" It then followed the publication with share after share via social media, with tweets such as \"Why a 'basic income' for all is a bad idea for all\", and \"Why the Green Party is wrong to support a 'basic income' for all.\" All of this would seem pretty damning to the many becoming recently interested in learning more about the idea of a universal basic income -- that is the idea that each and every citizen should be provided an income floor sufficient to cover life's most basic needs like food and shelter -- if The Economist had not curiously undermined their case by simplistically basing their entire argument on a single equation. If important economic discussions were really as simple as discounting entire areas of study with a short paragraph involving a single equation, there wouldn't even be a need for The Economist to exist in the first place, now would there? Imagine if all of this back and forth about increasing minimum wages could be ended by just pointing to an equation written half a century ago. We can't do that though, because minimum wage discussions involve a lot of variables, and study after study has been published about them. Study after study has also been published about the idea of universal basic income over the years, and if we extend the discussion to unconditional cash transfers, the discussion involves piles of papers from hundreds of academics across multiple fields of science and economics. And this is because the idea of basic income, although seemingly simple sounding, is a very complex discussion in which to engage. So let's dive into the complexities that The Economist entirely ignored, shall we? The Argument In 1970 James Tobin, an economist, produced a simple formula for calculating their cost. Suppose the government needs to levy tax of 25 percent of national income to fund public services such as education, policing and infrastructure. Paying for a basic income worth 10 percent of the average income requires average taxes to rise by ten percentage points, to 35 percnet. A basic income worth 20 percent of the average income requires average taxes to be 20 percentage points higher, at 45 percent, and so on. Eradicating relative poverty, defined as income beneath 60 percent of the median, would require tax rates approaching 85 percent. The heart of The Economist's argument therefore lies in the belief that if 25 percent of everyone's income tax goes to fund government, then a basic income given to all, of sufficient size to raise everyone above the federal poverty line, would require raising everyone's taxes an additional 60 percent to a new grand total of 85 percent. This is the entire argument. And all of the following is what it ignores. The Economist estimate: 60 percent additional income tax Average income? Really? Due to how far our income distributions have skewed in the past half century, it should be no surprise that average incomes have shifted upwards considerably, while the median income adjusted for inflation has actually fallen. So whereas Tobin could have been considered safer in making such a statement in the 20th century, we can't make the same statement in the 21st century, because our income distribution now looks like this. Source: New York Times With a chart like the above in mind, let's not even look at the average and instead look at the total of all income in the US, and that's $8.4 trillion. So, if we wish to discuss a universal basic income of $12,000 per adult and $4,000 per child, which is the least expensive design possible capable of eliminating poverty across all household sizes, this would cost about $3 trillion and therefore require an additional income tax of 35.7 percent. Nowhere near 60 percent is it? New estimate: 35.7 percent additional income tax What about all our current spending? However, even this estimate is too high, because The Economist also left out something else that's very pertinent to this discussion, which is the ability to eliminate the 100+ programs we are already funding that we'll no longer require with a basic income, like TANF, SNAP, EITC, WIC, CTC, etc. in addition to all the many subsidies and deductions we could eliminate from the tax code itself. It may be of great surprise just how much this amounts to, in the form of the taxes and transfers we're already providing to all five income quintiles. (A quintile is economist speak for 20 percent of the population) Source: Tax Foundation Those blue bars basically represent the universal basic income we already have, which remains mostly invisible even to those receiving it, save for those in the lowest quintile who get to experience the full extent of the federal bureaucracy we put in place to administrate it. For the most part, those in the higher quintiles receive their transfers without ever thinking of them as transfers, like the mortgage interest rate deduction for example. Now, to be fair, a basic income would not entirely eliminate each of these blue bars, as these bars include programs like Medicaid which would be inadvisable to eliminate with basic income. But a great deal of money can be saved by eliminating a substantial portion of them. By my own calculations, we could eliminate about $1.5 trillion dollars of spending on present programs. So going back to the $3 trillion estimate of UBI, it would actually be more like $1.5 trillion. And so again using total income for our calculation, we would require an additional income tax of not 60 percent, or even 35.7 percent, but 17.8 percent. New estimate: 17.8 percent additional income tax Speaking of flat taxes... One might now think The Economist is already pretty much as far off as they could possibly get in their calculation, claiming 60 percent instead of 17.8 percent in additional taxes, but this estimate is built off of a flat tax universally applied. We don't actually have flat income taxes, so in reality, the additional 17.8 percent could come in the form of a higher increase for the top quintile, with no increase for the bottom four quintiles. But let's instead pretend we use a flat income tax to fund a UBI. Imagine someone earning $20,000. To fund their basic income, we would need to raise their taxes by 17.8 percent, but let's use 20 percent for ease of calculating. Their tax burden goes up $4,000. However, because they also receive a basic income of $12,000, they actually see their overall tax burden decreased by $8,000. For them, the UBI is essentially a giant tax rebate. If their current tax burden is $2,000, their tax rate before basic income is 10 percent. After basic income, their tax rate is negative 30 percent because they end up with $26,000 for earning $20,000. New estimate: Negative income taxation (aka tax rebates for most) So a basic income is basically affordable after all This is how a universal basic income would actually work. Because inequality has reached such extreme degrees, and because we already spend so much money on existing government programs no longer necessary with a basic income for all, the required price tag is not an income tax increase of 60 percent. It's not even an income tax increase of 35 percent or 25 percent. It's a potential income tax increase of under 20 percent. And because a very small amount of people have an almost unimaginable amount of money at the very top, a basic income could actually decrease almost everyone else's income tax burdens except for theirs. Keeping in mind our present level of inequality and its negative effects on economic growth, this is actually even exactly what the richest should want, because although they would pay more in taxes for universal basic income, leaving them a slightly thinner although still very thick slice of the overall pie, the slice of the pie itself would grow, leaving even them better off as well. This is largely due to economic multiplier effects where $1 given to those with lower incomes has three times the growth effects on GDP as giving the same $1 to those who already have a great many dollars. Meanwhile, as if all of the above isn't enough to show how affordable a $1,000 per month universal basic income actually is, it's vital we understand just how much less we can spend as a society, simply by preventing all the costs of poverty that we'd never have to pay in the first place anymore. And if we also care about what we're going to do about all the jobs technology stands to eliminate in the years ahead, we should definitely care about figuring out how we can all be better off in an economy that actually works better with fewer jobs instead of worse off in an economy that's fundamentally broken. It's disappointing all of this economic complexity in regards to the affordability of basic income is nowhere to be found within The Economist. For this is a discussion we need to be having, and not one to be so easily dismissed as too expensive. Instead, we should consider the distinct possibility that continuing on without basic income is what potentially carries the highest price tag of all.

        "articles": "\"Kidnapped for Christ\" is a compelling new documentary that follows the experiences of several American teenagers after they were kidnapped from their homes and shipped to Evangelical Reform schools located in the Dominican Republic. Many of these teenagers' parents discover their children are either gay or experience same-sex attraction, and are sent to “therapeutic Christian boarding school[s]” in order to \"transform into healthy Christian adults\" in an environment outside of U.S. law. Directed Kate S. Logan with Lance Bass cited as an executive producer, the film is currently engaged in a Kickstarter campaign in order to be fully funded. The Huffington Post sat down with Logan this week in order to better understand the function of these reform camps, the experiences of kidnapped youth go through while there, and why this film is important. The Huffington Post: Why did you feel this documentary was necessary? Actually, when I originally got the idea to make the film, I had no idea that there was anything controversial about this school. I was under the impression that it was just an alternative therapy program with a cultural exchange element. It wasn't until I got permission to film and started investigating that I realized what I had gotten myself into. Once I saw what was really going on at Escuela Caribe, I felt I needed to help expose the truth of what this school was doing in the name of \"therapy.\" Why do you think the majority of the public knows so little about these reform institutions? I think it's because the victims of these programs are teens and children and they are often so traumatized by their experiences that they don't speak about it for years -- if at all. Also, a lot of times former students of reform schools get labeled \"bad\" simply because they were sent to a place for \"bad\" kids, so no one believes their stories. Some of the things that go on in these places are, quite frankly, so bizarre and horrible that it's hard to believe if you aren't there to see it yourself. With the Internet it's easier for teens who have been sent to these places to speak out and connect with others who've gone through the same thing, but it's still a relatively small group who are talking about it. What do people undergo in these camps? I mean, how much time have you got? The \"treatment\" was called \"Culture Shock Therapy\" by the administrators. So their actual methods involved jarring kids enough that they were more malleable emotionally and mentally. That was Step One, and it involved strenuous and intense physical labor and exercise, constant repetition of religious and program-written texts, and severe punishments for students who \"acted out.\" Those punishments could be hours of manual labor, exercising, or actual physical beatings, which they called \"swats.\" That was the program. All of that stuff is in their handbook. Then there was so much physical and emotional abuse that went on besides that, combined with a generally oppressive atmosphere of conformity and helplessness. These kids were afraid to speak out, afraid to tell their parents about was was going on, and as a result a lot of them just felt helpless and alone, like they were stuck in this horrible place with no one to talk to and no one to help them. What can viewers expect from the film? Viewers can expect to be consistently shocked. Shocked at the fact that these camps exist, shocked that they are making money from the systematic abuse of teens, and shocked that nobody is doing a thing about it. But it's also a story about a community rallying around a friend and neighbor to help him out of the camp when he's at his most helpless and alone. What are you hoping to accomplish with the film/what do you want viewers to take away? We hope viewers will come out of the film outraged and ready to fight for these teens, knowing that it can be done from the story in our film. There's almost no regulation for these programs -- even for ones that are based in the U.S.; teens have died and continue to die in these camps, and the ones that don't are traumatized. We want viewers to come out set on making sure none of that happens to any teens ever again, and ready to engage with their senators or representatives to make sure legislation is passed to regulate this industry.

After SCOTUS ruled 5-4 in favor of nationwide same-sex marriage Friday, Facebook released a free tool that let users change their profiles to feature a rainbow overlay that resembles the pride flag. The feature garnered more than half a billion likes over three days and 26 million people changed their main photos, according to CNN.

St. Petersburg lawmaker Vitaly Milonov -- notorious for backing Russia's \"homosexual propaganda\" legislation -- asked Russia's media watchdog, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, to block Facebook in the nation for violating the law with its pride filter. \"It is a crude violation of Russian legislation. Facebook has no age limits, it is impossible to control how many minors are there,” he said on Russian radio Saturday evening, per the Express Tribune. “That is why it would be completely normal to pull the plug on Facebook in Russia.”",

        "articles": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and his wife, Jane Sanders, the former president of Burlington College, have hired lawyers in the face of a federal investigation into bank fraud allegations related to a multimillion-dollar loan for the now-defunct liberal arts college. On Saturday, CBS News confirmed that the couple had hired high-profile defense lawyers in light of the FBI probe looking into whether Jane Sanders falsified bank documents in 2010 in an attempt to secure a $10 million loan to expand Burlington College’s campus. That loan, which was obtained, was a factor in the school shuttering its doors in 2016 after it found itself unable to pay off its debt. Jane Sanders, who served as president of Burlington College from 2004 to 2011, has been accused of falsely inflating projected donor contributions in the loan application. The federal probe, according to Politico magazine, may also be looking into whether Sen. Sanders used his political influence to put “improper pressure” on the bank to approve that loan. The outlet said the evidence for that seems “thin at best,” but the investigation has still prompted Sanders to hire Burlington lawyer Rich Cassidy. Jane Sanders has reportedly retained Larry Robbins, a Washington-based defense attorney. The Sanderses have kept mostly mum about the probe. During a May interview with Burlington’s WCAX-TV, however, the senator dismissed the allegations as “nonsense” and suggested they were politically motivated. “[This] was initiated by Trump’s campaign manager, somebody who does this all of the time, has gone after a number of Democrats and progressives in this state,” said Sanders, referring to Brady Toensing, a chairman for the Trump campaign in Vermont who submitted the original complaint that led to the investigation. Toensing has said the probe was launched in early 2016, during President Barack Obama’s tenure. “The FBI has not disclosed what prompted its investigation, but it was started more than a year ago under President Obama, his Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and his United States attorney, all of whom are Democrats,” Toensing said in a May statement, according to VTDigger. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ top political adviser, told CBS this week that the accusations against Sen. Sanders are “baseless” and that the bank loan in question had been “approved by the financial board at the college.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) are both calling for Congress to investigate the New York Federal Reserve Bank after recently released secret recordings show the central bank allegedly going light on firms it was supposed to regulate. Warren and Brown, both members of the Senate Banking Committee, called for an investigation of the New York Fed after Carmen Segarra, a former examiner at the bank, released secretly recorded tapes that she claims show her superiors telling her to go easy on private banks. Segarra says that she was fired from her job in 2012 for refusing to overlook Goldman’s lack of a conflict of interest policy and other questionable practices that should have brought tougher regulatory scrutiny. After Segarra made the tapes public in a joint report with ProPublica and This American Life on Friday, Warren was quick to call on Congress to take action. “Congress must hold oversight hearings on the disturbing issues raised by today’s whistleblower report when it returns in November, because it’s our job to make sure our financial regulators are doing their jobs,” Warren said in a statement on Friday. “When regulators care more about protecting big banks from accountability than they do about protecting the American people from risky and illegal behavior on Wall Street, it threatens our whole economy. We learned this the hard way in 2008.” In an interview with This American Life and ProPublica, Segarra described numerous instances in which she said she alerted her bosses to questionable practices at Goldman. In one instance, she said she alerted a colleague that a senior compliance officer at Goldman had said that the bank's view was that “once clients became wealthy enough, certain consumer laws didn’t apply to them.” Segarra claims that her New York Fed colleagues asked her to ignore the remark and change meeting minutes she had taken, which contained evidence of what the Goldman executive said. \"These allegations deserve a full and thorough investigation, and American taxpayers deserve regulators who will fight each day on their behalf,” Brown said in a statement This American Life and ProPublica also unearthed an internal study by the New York Fed in 2009, which found that the institution had a culture where regulators had gotten too cozy to the banks they were supposed to scrutinize and were discouraged from voicing their honest opinions. In statements released in response to the This American Life and ProPublica report, both the New York Fed and Goldman Sachs denied any kind of wrongdoing. “The New York Fed categorically rejects the allegations being made about the integrity of its supervision of financial institutions,” the Fed said in a lengthy statement on its website. \"The decision to terminate Ms. Segarra’s employment with the New York Fed was based entirely on performance grounds, not because she raised concerns as a member of an examination team about any institution.” The bank added that it could not comment further on the tapes because Segarra is still pursuing a wrongful termination suit against it. In its own statement, Goldman Sachs went after Segarra, saying that she applied for employment there multiple times and that it has long had a comprehensive conflict of interest policy.

        "articles": "Who Is the Gravest Danger to World Peace? Cross-posted with TomDispatch.com Throughout the world there is great relief and optimism about the nuclear deal reached in Vienna between Iran and the P5+1 nations, the five veto-holding members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany. Most of the world apparently shares the assessment of the U.S. Arms Control Association that “the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action establishes a strong and effective formula for blocking all of the pathways by which Iran could acquire material for nuclear weapons for more than a generation and a verification system to promptly detect and deter possible efforts by Iran to covertly pursue nuclear weapons that will last indefinitely.” There are, however, striking exceptions to the general enthusiasm: the United States and its closest regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia. One consequence of this is that U.S. corporations, much to their chagrin, are prevented from flocking to Tehran along with their European counterparts. Prominent sectors of U.S. power and opinion share the stand of the two regional allies and so are in a state of virtual hysteria over “the Iranian threat.” Sober commentary in the United States, pretty much across the spectrum, declares that country to be “the gravest threat to world peace.” Even supporters of the agreement here are wary, given the exceptional gravity of that threat. After all, how can we trust the Iranians with their terrible record of aggression, violence, disruption, and deceit? Opposition within the political class is so strong that public opinion has shifted quickly from significant support for the deal to an even split. Republicans are almost unanimously opposed to the agreement. The current Republican primaries illustrate the proclaimed reasons. Senator Ted Cruz, considered one of the intellectuals among the crowded field of presidential candidates, warns that Iran may still be able to produce nuclear weapons and could someday use one to set off an Electro Magnetic Pulse that “would take down the electrical grid of the entire eastern seaboard” of the United States, killing “tens of millions of Americans.” The two most likely winners, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, are battling over whether to bomb Iran immediately after being elected or after the first Cabinet meeting. The one candidate with some foreign policy experience, Lindsey Graham, describes the deal as “a death sentence for the state of Israel,” which will certainly come as a surprise to Israeli intelligence and strategic analysts -- and which Graham knows to be utter nonsense, raising immediate questions about actual motives. Keep in mind that the Republicans long ago abandoned the pretense of functioning as a normal congressional party. They have, as respected conservative political commentator Norman Ornstein of the right-wing American Enterprise Institute observed, become a “radical insurgency” that scarcely seeks to participate in normal congressional politics. Since the days of President Ronald Reagan, the party leadership has plunged so far into the pockets of the very rich and the corporate sector that they can attract votes only by mobilizing parts of the population that have not previously been an organized political force. Among them are extremist evangelical Christians, now probably a majority of Republican voters; remnants of the former slave-holding states; nativists who are terrified that “they” are taking our white Christian Anglo-Saxon country away from us; and others who turn the Republican primaries into spectacles remote from the mainstream of modern society -- though not from the mainstream of the most powerful country in world history. The departure from global standards, however, goes far beyond the bounds of the Republican radical insurgency. Across the spectrum, there is, for instance, general agreement with the “pragmatic” conclusion of General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the Vienna deal does not “prevent the United States from striking Iranian facilities if officials decide that it is cheating on the agreement,” even though a unilateral military strike is “far less likely” if Iran behaves. Former Clinton and Obama Middle East negotiator Dennis Ross typically recommends that “Iran must have no doubts that if we see it moving towards a weapon, that would trigger the use of force” even after the termination of the deal, when Iran is theoretically free to do what it wants. In fact, the existence of a termination point 15 years hence is, he adds, \"the greatest single problem with the agreement.\" He also suggests that the U.S. provide Israel with specially outfitted B-52 bombers and bunker-busting bombs to protect itself before that terrifying date arrives. “The Greatest Threat” Opponents of the nuclear deal charge that it does not go far enough. Some supporters agree, holding that “if the Vienna deal is to mean anything, the whole of the Middle East must rid itself of weapons of mass destruction.” The author of those words, Iran’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Javad Zarif, added that “Iran, in its national capacity and as current chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement [the governments of the large majority of the world’s population], is prepared to work with the international community to achieve these goals, knowing full well that, along the way, it will probably run into many hurdles raised by the skeptics of peace and diplomacy.” Iran has signed “a historic nuclear deal,” he continues, and now it is the turn of Israel, “the holdout.” Israel, of course, is one of the three nuclear powers, along with India and Pakistan, whose weapons programs have been abetted by the United States and that refuse to sign the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Zarif was referring to the regular five-year NPT review conference, which ended in failure in April when the U.S. (joined by Canada and Great Britain) once again blocked efforts to move toward a weapons-of-mass-destruction-free zone in the Middle East. Such efforts have been led by Egypt and other Arab states for 20 years. As Jayantha Dhanapala and Sergio Duarte, leading figures in the promotion of such efforts at the NPT and other U.N. agencies, observe in “Is There a Future for the NPT?,” an article in the journal of the Arms Control Association: “The successful adoption in 1995 of the resolution on the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in the Middle East was the main element of a package that permitted the indefinite extension of the NPT.” The NPT, in turn, is the most important arms control treaty of all. If it were adhered to, it could end the scourge of nuclear weapons. Repeatedly, implementation of the resolution has been blocked by the U.S., most recently by President Obama in 2010 and again in 2015, as Dhanapala and Duarte point out, “on behalf of a state that is not a party to the NPT and is widely believed to be the only one in the region possessing nuclear weapons” -- a polite and understated reference to Israel. This failure, they hope, “will not be the coup de grâce to the two longstanding NPT objectives of accelerated progress on nuclear disarmament and establishing a Middle Eastern WMD-free zone.” A nuclear-weapons-free Middle East would be a straightforward way to address whatever threat Iran allegedly poses, but a great deal more is at stake in Washington’s continuing sabotage of the effort in order to protect its Israeli client. After all, this is not the only case in which opportunities to end the alleged Iranian threat have been undermined by Washington, raising further questions about just what is actually at stake. In considering this matter, it is instructive to examine both the unspoken assumptions in the situation and the questions that are rarely asked. Let us consider a few of these assumptions, beginning with the most serious: that Iran is the gravest threat to world peace. In the U.S., it is a virtual cliché among high officials and commentators that Iran wins that grim prize. There is also a world outside the U.S. and although its views are not reported in the mainstream here, perhaps they are of some interest. According to the leading western polling agencies (WIN/Gallup International), the prize for “greatest threat” is won by the United States. The rest of the world regards it as the gravest threat to world peace by a large margin. In second place, far below, is Pakistan, its ranking probably inflated by the Indian vote. Iran is ranked below those two, along with China, Israel, North Korea, and Afghanistan. “The World’s Leading Supporter of Terrorism” Turning to the next obvious question, what in fact is the Iranian threat? Why, for example, are Israel and Saudi Arabia trembling in fear over that country? Whatever the threat is, it can hardly be military. Years ago, U.S. intelligence informed Congress that Iran has very low military expenditures by the standards of the region and that its strategic doctrines are defensive -- designed, that is, to deter aggression. The U.S. intelligence community has also reported that it has no evidence Iran is pursuing an actual nuclear weapons program and that “Iran’s nuclear program and its willingness to keep open the possibility of developing nuclear weapons is a central part of its deterrent strategy.” The authoritative SIPRI review of global armaments ranks the U.S., as usual, way in the lead in military expenditures. China comes in second with about one-third of U.S. expenditures. Far below are Russia and Saudi Arabia, which are nonetheless well above any western European state. Iran is scarcely mentioned. Full details are provided in an April report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which finds “a conclusive case that the Arab Gulf states have... an overwhelming advantage of Iran in both military spending and access to modern arms.” Iran’s military spending, for instance, is a fraction of Saudi Arabia’s and far below even the spending of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Altogether, the Gulf Cooperation Council states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE -- outspend Iran on arms by a factor of eight, an imbalance that goes back decades. The CSIS report adds: “The Arab Gulf states have acquired and are acquiring some of the most advanced and effective weapons in the world [while] Iran has essentially been forced to live in the past, often relying on systems originally delivered at the time of the Shah.” In other words, they are virtually obsolete. When it comes to Israel, of course, the imbalance is even greater. Possessing the most advanced U.S. weaponry and a virtual offshore military base for the global superpower, it also has a huge stock of nuclear weapons. To be sure, Israel faces the “existential threat” of Iranian pronouncements: Supreme Leader Khamenei and former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad famously threatened it with destruction. Except that they didn’t -- and if they had, it would be of little moment. Ahmadinejad, for instance, predicted that “under God’s grace [the Zionist regime] will be wiped off the map.” In other words, he hoped that regime change would someday take place. Even that falls far short of the direct calls in both Washington and Tel Aviv for regime change in Iran, not to speak of the actions taken to implement regime change. These, of course, go back to the actual “regime change” of 1953, when the U.S. and Britain organized a military coup to overthrow Iran’s parliamentary government and install the dictatorship of the Shah, who proceeded to amass one of the worst human rights records on the planet. These crimes were certainly known to readers of the reports of Amnesty International and other human rights organizations, but not to readers of the U.S. press, which has devoted plenty of space to Iranian human rights violations -- but only since 1979 when the Shah’s regime was overthrown. (To check the facts on this, read The U.S. Press and Iran, a carefully documented study by Mansour Farhang and William Dorman.) None of this is a departure from the norm. The United States, as is well known, holds the world championship title in regime change and Israel is no laggard either. The most destructive of its invasions of Lebanon in 1982 was explicitly aimed at regime change, as well as at securing its hold on the occupied territories. The pretexts offered were thin indeed and collapsed at once. That, too, is not unusual and pretty much independent of the nature of the society -- from the laments in the Declaration of Independence about the “merciless Indian savages” to Hitler’s defense of Germany from the “wild terror” of the Poles. No serious analyst believes that Iran would ever use, or even threaten to use, a nuclear weapon if it had one, and so face instant destruction. There is, however, real concern that a nuclear weapon might fall into jihadi hands -- not thanks to Iran, but via U.S. ally Pakistan. In the journal of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, two leading Pakistani nuclear scientists, Pervez Hoodbhoy and Zia Mian, write that increasing fears of “militants seizing nuclear weapons or materials and unleashing nuclear terrorism [have led to]... the creation of a dedicated force of over 20,000 troops to guard nuclear facilities. There is no reason to assume, however, that this force would be immune to the problems associated with the units guarding regular military facilities,” which have frequently suffered attacks with “insider help.” In brief, the problem is real, just displaced to Iran thanks to fantasies concocted for other reasons. Other concerns about the Iranian threat include its role as “the world’s leading supporter of terrorism,” which primarily refers to its support for Hezbollah and Hamas. Both of those movements emerged in resistance to U.S.-backed Israeli violence and aggression, which vastly exceeds anything attributed to these villains, let alone the normal practice of the hegemonic power whose global drone assassination campaign alone dominates (and helps to foster) international terrorism. Those two villainous Iranian clients also share the crime of winning the popular vote in the only free elections in the Arab world. Hezbollah is guilty of the even more heinous crime of compelling Israel to withdraw from its occupation of southern Lebanon, which took place in violation of U.N. Security Council orders dating back decades and involved an illegal regime of terror and sometimes extreme violence. Whatever one thinks of Hezbollah, Hamas, or other beneficiaries of Iranian support, Iran hardly ranks high in support of terror worldwide. “Fueling Instability” Another concern, voiced at the U.N. by U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power, is the “instability that Iran fuels beyond its nuclear program.” The U.S. will continue to scrutinize this misbehavior, she declared. In that, she echoed the assurance Defense Secretary Ashton Carter offered while standing on Israel’s northern border that “we will continue to help Israel counter Iran’s malign influence” in supporting Hezbollah, and that the U.S. reserves the right to use military force against Iran as it deems appropriate. The way Iran “fuels instability” can be seen particularly dramatically in Iraq where, among other crimes, it alone at once came to the aid of Kurds defending themselves from the invasion of Islamic State militants, even as it is building a $2.5 billion power plant in the southern port city of Basra to try to bring electrical power back to the level reached before the 2003 invasion. Ambassador Power’s usage is, however, standard: Thanks to that invasion, hundreds of thousands were killed and millions of refugees generated, barbarous acts of torture were committed -- Iraqis have compared the destruction to the Mongol invasion of the thirteenth century -- leaving Iraq the unhappiest country in the world according to WIN/Gallup polls. Meanwhile, sectarian conflict was ignited, tearing the region to shreds and laying the basis for the creation of the monstrosity that is ISIS. And all of that is called “stabilization.” Only Iran’s shameful actions, however, “fuel instability.” The standard usage sometimes reaches levels that are almost surreal, as when liberal commentator James Chace, former editor of Foreign Affairs, explained that the U.S. sought to “destabilize a freely elected Marxist government in Chile” because “we were determined to seek stability” under the Pinochet dictatorship. Others are outraged that Washington should negotiate at all with a “contemptible” regime like Iran’s with its horrifying human rights record and urge instead that we pursue “an American-sponsored alliance between Israel and the Sunni states.” So writes Leon Wieseltier, contributing editor to the venerable liberal journal the Atlantic, who can barely conceal his visceral hatred for all things Iranian. With a straight face, this respected liberal intellectual recommends that Saudi Arabia, which makes Iran look like a virtual paradise, and Israel, with its vicious crimes in Gaza and elsewhere, should ally to teach that country good behavior. Perhaps the recommendation is not entirely unreasonable when we consider the human rights records of the regimes the U.S. has imposed and supported throughout the world. Though the Iranian government is no doubt a threat to its own people, it regrettably breaks no records in this regard, not descending to the level of favored U.S. allies. That, however, cannot be the concern of Washington, and surely not Tel Aviv or Riyadh. It might also be useful to recall -- surely Iranians do -- that not a day has passed since 1953 in which the U.S. was not harming Iranians. After all, as soon as they overthrew the hated U.S.-imposed regime of the Shah in 1979, Washington put its support behind Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who would, in 1980, launch a murderous assault on their country. President Reagan went so far as to deny Saddam’s major crime, his chemical warfare assault on Iraq’s Kurdish population, which he blamed on Iran instead. When Saddam was tried for crimes under U.S. auspices, that horrendous crime, as well as others in which the U.S. was complicit, was carefully excluded from the charges, which were restricted to one of his minor crimes, the murder of 148 Shi’ites in 1982, a footnote to his gruesome record. Saddam was such a valued friend of Washington that he was even granted a privilege otherwise accorded only to Israel. In 1987, his forces were allowed to attack a U.S. naval vessel, the USS Stark, with impunity, killing 37 crewmen. (Israel had acted similarly in its 1967 attack on the USS Liberty.) Iran pretty much conceded defeat shortly after, when the U.S. launched Operation Praying Mantis against Iranian ships and oil platforms in Iranian territorial waters. That operation culminated when the USS Vincennes, under no credible threat, shot down an Iranian civilian airliner in Iranian airspace, with 290 killed -- and the subsequent granting of a Legion of Merit award to the commander of the Vincennes for “exceptionally meritorious conduct” and for maintaining a “calm and professional atmosphere” during the period when the attack on the airliner took place. Comments philosopher Thill Raghu, “We can only stand in awe of such display of American exceptionalism!” After the war ended, the U.S. continued to support Saddam Hussein, Iran’s primary enemy. President George H.W. Bush even invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to the U.S. for advanced training in weapons production, an extremely serious threat to Iran. Sanctions against that country were intensified, including against foreign firms dealing with it, and actions were initiated to bar it from the international financial system. In recent years the hostility has extended to sabotage, the murder of nuclear scientists (presumably by Israel), and cyberwar, openly proclaimed with pride. The Pentagon regards cyberwar as an act of war, justifying a military response, as does NATO, which affirmed in September 2014 that cyber attacks may trigger the collective defense obligations of the NATO powers -- when we are the target that is, not the perpetrators. “The Prime Rogue State” It is only fair to add that there have been breaks in this pattern. President George W. Bush, for example, offered several significant gifts to Iran by destroying its major enemies, Saddam Hussein and the Taliban. He even placed Iran’s Iraqi enemy under its influence after the U.S. defeat, which was so severe that Washington had to abandon its officially declared goals of establishing permanent military bases (“enduring camps”) and ensuring that U.S. corporations would have privileged access to Iraq’s vast oil resources. Do Iranian leaders intend to develop nuclear weapons today? We can decide for ourselves how credible their denials are, but that they had such intentions in the past is beyond question. After all, it was asserted openly on the highest authority and foreign journalists were informed that Iran would develop nuclear weapons “certainly, and sooner than one thinks.” The father of Iran’s nuclear energy program and former head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization was confident that the leadership’s plan “was to build a nuclear bomb.” The CIA also reported that it had “no doubt” Iran would develop nuclear weapons if neighboring countries did (as they have). All of this was, of course, under the Shah, the “highest authority” just quoted and at a time when top U.S. officials -- Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Henry Kissinger, among others -- were urging him to proceed with his nuclear programs and pressuring universities to accommodate these efforts. Under such pressures, my own university, MIT, made a deal with the Shah to admit Iranian students to the nuclear engineering program in return for grants he offered and over the strong objections of the student body, but with comparably strong faculty support (in a meeting that older faculty will doubtless remember well). Asked later why he supported such programs under the Shah but opposed them more recently, Kissinger responded honestly that Iran was an ally then. Putting aside absurdities, what is the real threat of Iran that inspires such fear and fury? A natural place to turn for an answer is, again, U.S. intelligence. Recall its analysis that Iran poses no military threat, that its strategic doctrines are defensive, and that its nuclear programs (with no effort to produce bombs, as far as can be determined) are “a central part of its deterrent strategy.” Who, then, would be concerned by an Iranian deterrent? The answer is plain: the rogue states that rampage in the region and do not want to tolerate any impediment to their reliance on aggression and violence. In the lead in this regard are the U.S. and Israel, with Saudi Arabia trying its best to join the club with its invasion of Bahrain (to support the crushing of a reform movement there) and now its murderous assault on Yemen, accelerating a growing humanitarian catastrophe in that country. For the United States, the characterization is familiar. Fifteen years ago, the prominent political analyst Samuel Huntington, professor of the science of government at Harvard, warned in the establishment journal Foreign Affairs that for much of the world the U.S. was “becoming the rogue superpower... the single greatest external threat to their societies.” Shortly after, his words were echoed by Robert Jervis, the president of the American Political Science Association: “In the eyes of much of the world, in fact, the prime rogue state today is the United States.” As we have seen, global opinion supports this judgment by a substantial margin. Furthermore, the mantle is worn with pride. That is the clear meaning of the insistence of the political class that the U.S. reserves the right to resort to force if it unilaterally determines that Iran is violating some commitment. This policy is of long standing, especially for liberal Democrats, and by no means restricted to Iran. The Clinton Doctrine, for instance, confirmed that the U.S. was entitled to resort to the “unilateral use of military power” even to ensure “uninhibited access to key markets, energy supplies, and strategic resources,” let alone alleged “security” or “humanitarian” concerns. Adherence to various versions of this doctrine has been well confirmed in practice, as need hardly be discussed among people willing to look at the facts of current history. These are among the critical matters that should be the focus of attention in analyzing the nuclear deal at Vienna, whether it stands or is sabotaged by Congress, as it may well be.

        "articles": "If you're a minimum wage earner and of drinking age, be sure to raise a glass when the ball drops Wednesday night. There's a decent chance you'll be getting a pay raise. Thanks to a raft of state-level laws and ballot measures this year, 20 states will be hiking their minimum wages on New Year's Day -- evidence of a growing nationwide move toward higher mandatory pay despite congressional inertia on the issue. With a proposal to raise the $7.25 federal minimum wage to $10.10 languishing on Capitol Hill, more and more states are choosing to bypass Congress and raise the wage floor on their own. That trend has even come to red states like Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota, where voters approved various minimum wage ballot measures in the November elections. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimates that the new raises will boost the income of 3.1 million low-wage workers. That includes workers who currently earn minimum wage, as well as workers who earn slightly more than minimum wage but who are still likely to see an increase as employers adjust their pay scales upward. Of course, some employers may respond to the higher wage mandates by cutting hours, though for many workers the wage gains will cover the hours that may be lost. The Jan. 1 pay raises will total about $1.6 billion in additional wages, which EPI says will act as a modest economic stimulus, since minimum wage workers are likely to spend the extra cash on groceries and other goods, rather than tucking it away or putting it in the stock market. Minimum wage workers in Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia will all see their pay go up on Jan. 1. Minimum wage workers in Delaware and Minnesota are also expected to receive a pay hike in June and August 2015, respectively. (For details on the specific amounts by which wages will go up in each state, take a look at EPI's data here.) The upcoming wage hikes underscore the rift between congressional Republicans and the rest of the country when it comes to the minimum wage. The idea of raising the wage floor tends to poll extremely well, with at least two-thirds of respondents in most surveys supporting it, including many conservatives. Nevertheless, Congress hasn't authorized a federal minimum wage raise since 2009, with Republicans standing in the way of more recent efforts. Yet as of the new year, for the first time a majority of states -- 29, to be exact -- will have minimum wages higher than the federal level. Many of those states have chosen to tie their wage floors to an inflation index, guaranteeing that the state minimum wage will rise over time along with the cost of living. HuffPost readers: Are you seeing a raise due to the minimum wage hikes on New Years? Tell us about it. As in years past, Washington state will continue to have the highest minimum wage, going up to $9.47 per hour from its current rate of $9.32 an hour. Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont will also reach or surpass the $9 mark on New Year's Day. In addition to the 20 states bringing their wage floors up on Jan. 1, New York will be raising its own state minimum wage from $8 to $8.75 on Dec. 31. Due to the state's large population and the 75-cent increase, New York has the highest number of workers poised to benefit from this week's wage hikes -- a projected 711,000 people -- of any state raising its wages this week, according to EPI. These piecemeal raises represent a major victory for organized labor and its progressive allies, who in recent years have made large investments in state- and city-level minimum wage campaigns across the country. The raises also mark an accomplishment for fast-food workers involved in the union-backed Fight for $15 movement, who have effectively put a face to the low-wage workforce through their ongoing one-day strikes and protests.

        "articles": "When Donald Trump made his way down the escalator and strolled to the podium to announce his run for the White House, the last thing he was probably thinking was that his speech would cause such a corporate backlash and lead to businesses cutting ties with him and entire countries boycotting his Miss Universe contest. In his speech, Trump boasted about being \"really rich\", being \"really proud\" of his success, and then referring to others as stupid. However, he didn't stop there. Trump's most offensive comments came when discussing the Mexican-American border and immigration. \"They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" Sally Kohn summed it up perfectly in an article she wrote at CNN.com: \"Perhaps the lowest point, in a speech filled with low points, was when Trump started bashing Mexico and Mexicans -- and, in so doing, also bashed the fundamental values on which our own nation is founded.\" Since his speech, Trump has refused to back down from any of his offensive comments. When asked if he would take back any of his derogatory comments in interviews with MSNBC, CNN, and FOX News, Trump doubled down on his comments. So far, companies such as NBC Universal, Macy's, Serta, and even NASCAR have decided to end business relationships with him. Perhaps where Trump has been hit hardest, is with his Miss America and Miss Universe contests, which he co-owns. NBC, Univision, and others have announced that they will not be airing the Miss America and Miss Universe contests and numerous judges, co-hosts, and performers have dropped out. And it doesn't stop there. So far several countries have also started dropping out of the Miss Universe contest in response to Trump's racist comments. Recently, Mexico and Costa Rica announced that they will not be sending a representative to this year's contest. More recently, Panama announced that they too will not be sending a representative to this year's Miss Universe contest, citing \"solidarity\" with Mexicans offended by Trump's comments.

        "articles": "So that happened. This week, the House of Representatives voted to help banks and car dealerships discriminate against customers of color. And it wasn't just Republicans -- 88 Democrats, including Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) -- voted in favor of the legislation. Listen to HuffPost's analysis of the auto market discrimination bill in the podcast embedded above. Most dealerships are authorized to sell cars and make loans to finance the purchase. They send their customers' financial information to a bank, which then sends the dealer an appropriate interest rate for a borrower with that particular credit profile. But banks also permit dealers to \"mark up\" the interest rate on the loan to a higher level, and allow the dealership to pocket some of the additional charge. That, of course, creates incentives for the dealer to charge people higher interest rates. But lawsuits dating back to the 1990s have shown that people of color are more likely to have their interest rates marked up than white borrowers. Black, Latino and Asian-American borrowers also tend to see higher markups than white borrowers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued regulatory guidance in 2013 instructing companies on how to cope with this phenomenon. Since the markup practice tends to result in overcharging borrowers of color, the CFPB recommended that banks and dealerships ditch the practice. If they didn't, however, they needed to ensure that borrowers with similar credit profiles weren't receiving different interest rates due to their race or national origin. Since issuing the guidance, the CFPB has taken action against Honda and Ally Bank for overcharging borrowers of color, forcing them to return more than $100 million to their customers. This was apparently too much for banks and auto dealers to handle. They lobbied for a bill that would nullify the CFPB's regulatory move. The NAACP, the Urban League, the National Council of La Raza, Americans for Financial Reform and other groups opposed the legislation. The Congressional Progressive Caucus urged lawmakers to vote against it, as did Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the top-ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. President Barack Obama issued a statement saying he \"strongly opposes\" the bill, but stopped short of a formal veto threat. None of the opposition was enough to counter two interest groups that wield tremendous power on Capitol Hill. No Republicans voted against the bill to curb the CFPB's enforcement of anti-discrimination law this week, while 88 Democrats voted in favor. The legislation cleared by a vote of 332 to 96. The lopsided vote makes it a prime target for inclusion in a year-end government spending bill. In December 2014, Republicans secured a measure to subsidize risky Wall Street derivatives trading by including it in a bill to fund the government. Democrats would have had to shut down the government in order to reject the deregulation measure. At the time, then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) pointed to the dozens of votes the subsidy had received from Democrats as evidence that the provision should be considered uncontroversial.

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- North Carolina lawmakers filed legislation Monday to repeal the state's extreme anti-LGBT law, which, since its passage last month, has drawn a presidential rebuke and spurred businesses to pull out of the state. The bill, HB 946, would strike down the new law that, among other things, bars transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity, and prevents local municipalities from passing their own LGBT anti-discrimination ordinances. Here's a copy of the repeal legislation: Gov. Pat McCrory (R) has been widely criticized over the law, known as HB 2 before it was enacted. More than 180 businesses have condemned it as discriminatory and called for a repeal. Bruce Springsteen canceled a concert in protest. Former basketball player Charles Barkley called for moving the 2017 NBA All-Star Game out of Charlotte, while PayPal decided against expanding its business operations to the city. On Friday, President Barack Obama called the state law \"wrong\" and said it \"should be overturned.\" McCrory spokesman Josh Ellis responded by defending it. \"The governor respectfully disagrees with the political left's national agenda to mandate changes to basic, common-sense restroom norms,\" Ellis said in a statement. It's not likely the repeal bill will get very far. HB 2 passed the state House and Senate on wide margins, and the governor is standing by it. It appears more likely that, if the law goes down, it will be because of a lawsuit. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal are challenging it in federal court, arguing that it is unconstitutional because it violates the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the 14th Amendment. Critics of the law are still pressuring McCrory and the legislature to reverse course. On Monday, a coalition of civil rights, faith and business leaders delivered more than 150,000 signatures to the governor's office, urging a repeal of the law. Thousands of people are expected to rally outside the legislature. \"HB 2 was a reckless attempt to malign and marginalize transgender people, and it is bringing immense harm to our state's people, economy, and reputation,\" Sarah Preston, acting executive director of the ACLU of North Carolina, said in a statement. \"The General Assembly must work as expeditiously as possible to repeal this terrible law as it worked to pass it.\" McCrory's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the repeal legislation.

While the fact that Sanders yesterday swept \"Western Saturday\" (with votes in Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington) is a part of the analysis -- as is the fact that, in just a few hours of voting, Sanders managed to eliminate 22.5% of Hillary Clinton's 296-delegate lead -- it isn't the greater part. I'm not even focusing here on the fact that, after weeks of being told how staggeringly far ahead Clinton is in the pledged delegate race, her monumental margin ends up, as of today, being no more than 54.9% to 45.1%. A single-digit lead. With 1,750 pledged delegates -- nearly 45% of all pledged delegates -- yet to be awarded, across 22 future nominating contests. So: those are some pretty eye-popping numbers. Still, far more important to undercutting the specious media narrative about Bernie Sanders and diverse electorates is a somewhat broader observation: that thus far, six of the ten most diverse states in America have held Democratic nominating contests, and both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have won three of these contests. In two of her three wins in ultra-diverse states, Clinton won with relatively slim majorities: in Arizona she pulled 57.6% of the vote, and in Nevada, 52.6%. In both states, Clinton substantially underperformed pre-election polling. The RCP polling average in Arizona predicted a 30-point victory; instead, Clinton won by 17.7%, and in fact she lost the live (Election Day) voting to Sanders, 52% to 48%. Meanwhile, in Nevada, Clinton met the expectations set by polls taken in the 120 hours before the caucuses, but fell dramatically short of the last poll taken prior to that period, which predicted a 23-point Clinton victory instead of the 5.5-point one she got. This enabled Sanders to claim, not unfairly, that he'd made up more than 17 points on Clinton in the eight weeks leading up to the Silver State caucuses. The New York Times, getting it right for once, called Clinton's Nevada win \"narrow\". Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders won his three contests in ultra-diverse states -- Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington -- with 81.6%, 69.8%, and 72.7% shares of the vote, respectively. In all three states, Sanders exceeded expectations dramatically. Polling website FiveThirtyEight.com had predicted 8-point wins for Sanders in Hawaii and Alaska, and a more generous 17-point win in Washington. Instead, Sanders won Alaska by 61.5 points, Hawaii by 39.8, and Washington -- the largest of the three Western Saturday states -- by a jaw-dropping 45.6 points. (As a side note, Sanders also just won the Democrats Abroad primary -- which awards as many delegates as do Alaska, Vermont, or Wyoming -- 69% to 30%. While the demographic breakdown of Democrats Abroad voters is unknown, we do know that Sanders defeated Clinton in 167 of 170 countries -- those last four words might be worth reading twice -- and that in one of the three countries Clinton won, only five people voted. That means Sanders won among Democrats in every majority-nonwhite country in the world that has Democrats in it other than Nigeria, Singapore, and the Dominican Republic. As noted, only five people voted in Nigeria; in Singapore, Clinton's win was a relatively modest one, 58% to 42%. I won't list the 167 countries Sanders won, as I just don't have the space here.) If you thought these four decisive Sanders wins offered the national media a pretty good opportunity to drop its ridiculous narrative about Bernie Sanders supporters -- namely, that nearly all of them are white -- you either don't understand how firmly in the Clinton camp even mainstream media organizations are, or you don't pay any attention to domestic politics at all. Most of us knew what to expect from the media after seeing months of purportedly objective \"panels\" on CNN and MSNBC comprised entirely of Clinton surrogates or neutral reporters; watching media outlets fail to cover even a single second of election-night speeches by Sanders; and cringing as every major media organization continued counting \"super-delegates\" as though these were earned and confirmed \"votes,\" despite a DNC directive to not tally them until the summertime. Most importantly, most of us knew what to expect after the national media had ignored entirely Sanders' strong performances in, demographically speaking, the \"middle half\" of U.S. states -- that is, those states ranked 13th through 38th in terms of their white population. Sanders' record in these states is as follows (acknowledging exceedingly close results as ties): The total delegate count for these seventeen \"normative\" American states? Clinton 643, Sanders 566. 53.1% to 46.9%. So we see here that Clinton has a very slight edge in states (1) and delegates (77), but not a dramatic one -- especially given that in one of her \"win\" states, North Carolina, live (Election Day) voting was essentially a tie. Meanwhile, all of Sanders' wins were by large margins. When you add to the above seventeen states the six ultra-diverse ones referenced at the top of this article -- plus the Democrats Abroad primary -- the tally for Sanders looks like this: The total delegate count for these twenty-one diverse American states? Clinton 807, Sanders 749. 51.8% to 48.2%. Whereas none of the Sanders \"wins\" listed in this second chart were at all close, two of the wins Clinton banked were squeakers in one way or another: Nevada, because Clinton only won 52.7% to 47.2%; and North Carolina, because (again) Election Day voting there was a virtual tie. So, is it really the case that all the voting in the nation's most diverse states (at least those that have voted thus far) comes down to Clinton beating Sanders -- in delegates -- just 51.8% to 48.2%? Almost. What the above analysis really does is underscore how complicated questions of race are in America. For instance, the data assessment used at the head of this article to determine the ten most diverse states in America was one that considered mixed-race voters as \"non-white.\" For this reason, it did not include Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, or Texas -- states that would have appeared in the top ten if the question had simply been what percentage of each state's voters are Caucasian. But should that really be the measure we use to determine a state's demographic diversity? Certainly, it seems impermissibly reductive to blithely call mixed-race Americans \"Caucasian.\" Yet most media assessments of racial and ethnic demographics do exactly that. For this reason, I've used, in the middle of this article -- the part with the bullet-pointed lists -- a data assessment that ranks states solely by their Caucasian populations. This assessment offers no break-out for mixed-race Americans. So if you consider mixed-race voters, as of course we should, Sanders and Clinton have indeed both won three of the ten most diverse states. And if you don't -- that is, if you look instead at \"percentage-white\" data only, as the national media habitually does -- the seventeen American states that are the most \"normative\" racially and ethnically indeed have voted just 53% to 47% in Clinton's favor. So, somehow a 53%-47% delegate split in the seventeen most \"normative\" American states (demographically speaking) and a 3-3 split among the six most diverse states that have voted so far adds up to a compelling narrative about Sanders' inability to attract nonwhite voters? That's a head-scratcher for sure. If you think I'm just having fun with numbers here, look at it this way: right now Clinton leads Sanders by 226 delegates, and 215 of that 226-delegate lead (over 95% of it) can be attributed to just four states, three of which are majority-white: Georgia (53% white), Florida (55% white), Mississippi (57% white). Of these four states that account for almost the entirety of Clinton's lead on Sanders, only one of them -- Florida -- has any real chance of being won by the Democrats in the next four general elections. In other words, reports of Sanders' irrelevance to the full swath of Democratic voters are not just exaggerated, but laughable. Now, none of this is to say that Sanders performs just as well as Clinton among African-American voters, or Latino voters, though we can note that Sanders has improved his performance among both groups as time has gone on and that -- and this is perhaps the worst canard the media has perpetuated -- the fact that Clinton performs well among these two voting groups does not mean that Sanders is unpopular in these communities. Indeed, Sanders' favorability ratings wouldn't be 32 net points higher than Clinton's (+11 as compared to -21) if this were the case. But what the above data do tell us is that \"Western Saturday\" was the time for the media to finally put to rest its outlandish claim that Bernie Sanders doesn't do well in states with diverse populations -- as that narrative, we can say for certain, is untrue. Unfortunately, that sort of magnanimity from the corporate media just wasn't to be. Amazingly, most Sanders supporters I've spoken to, skeptical as they've been about the media's coverage of the Sanders campaign, are still absolutely appalled at what unfolded after Sanders absolutely dominated Clinton on \"Western Saturday\" -- which was, again, if we let demographic statistics be our guide, the day on the spring election calendar in which the largest number of racially and ethnically diverse populations got to weigh in on the Democratic primary race. But you know what? They've a right to be appalled, and even by the low standards set by news media coverage of the presidential election, it was appalling. Here's an abbreviated list of the shocking, indeed borderline racist political analyses heard on CNN during Western Saturday: I'm not including, in the list above, all the other absurd misstatements that CNN in particular filled the airwaves with -- such as Bakari Sellers stating that Clinton's 13.8% win in Ohio (after polling had predicted a victory by more than 30 points) was as miraculous a performance as Sanders' come-from-behind win in Michigan or (moreover) his making up of almost the entirety of a 42-point deficit in Illinois in just the last seven days of that campaign. So what explains all this journalistic malpractice? The same thing that explains the absence of Sanders surrogates or supporters on cable TV. The same thing that explains media blackouts of Sanders speeches. The same thing that explains super-delegate tallies having been used by cable news all spring -- successfully -- to influence public perception of the Clinton-Sanders race, despite their use for this purpose having been explicitly opposed by the Democratic National Committee. The same thing that explains Sanders having netted 21 delegates on \"Western Tuesday\" (the votes in Arizona, Idaho, and Utah) rather than losing between one and ten net delegates -- as predicted before the voting by the media -- without anyone coming on air thereafter to issue a mea culpa or even a well-done to Sanders. In short, the national media has a false narrative in its jaws like a dog with a bone and the only thing that will dislodge it is -- apparently -- Sanders not only winning the Democratic nomination for President but, also, each member of the media being allotted one Sanders voter apiece to pinch them mercilessly on the arm.

        "articles": "Once again, we've heard that the gunman was deranged. Once again, we've heard that gun control is imperative. What we aren't hearing is that Americans, for many more years and with greater intensity than inhabitants of other countries, have been groped and goosed and pummeled by a sophisticated, multi-trillion dollar drive to short-circuit deliberation and dialogue in order to spur the self-centered impulse buying that is ruining our civil society. This campaign isn't partisan or avowedly ideological. It isn't malevolent as often as it's mindless in civic-republican, non-market terms. As Daniel Greenwood and I argued in The Atlantic two years ago (and as you can hear me arguing on NPR, it's driven by fiduciaries and managers of anonymous, ever-shifting whorls of shareholders pursuing maximum profit and market share. They're civically mindless even when they're trading on fear and rage by pushing violent video games, guns, and devices to forestall armed home invasion, all in their increasingly financialized rush to bypass our brains and hearts on the way to our lower viscera and wallets. What we also aren't hearing from political leaders or business leaders, let alone from our Supreme Court, especially since the disastrous Citizens United ruling, is that these anonymous whorls are overwhelming our already-weakened capacity as citizens to deliberate about how best to regulate them. Freedom of speech means little if the invaders have megaphones while most citizens have laryngitis from straining to be heard. (Recall that Occupy protestors were denied megaphones and, soon enough, disbanded by militarized police.) Growing numbers of Americans are responding to the unending tsunami of titillation, unsubtle intimidation, and destruction of their political and economic options with heart-breakingly impulsive, socially corrosive and self-destructive behavior that includes not only the shootings but road rage, sale-day rampages, gladatorialization in sports, degrading and sadistic entertainment, sexual assaults, bullying, and, in futile response, the militarization of police, mass incarceration, intrusive surveillance, and new toleration of torture. It began innocently enough. I think of a moment in 1972 when I first heard the anodyne jingle, \"You deserve a break today. So get up and get away -- to McDonald's,\" on a transistor radio while sitting -- in a McDonald's, as it happened! -- in leafy Natick, Massachusetts. The message worked and seemed utterly harmless because it was playing off of lots of thick but voluntary social discipline. But countless other, increasingly sophisticated efforts were underway to dissolve that social strength, and just when declining remuneration and protection of work were also dissolving it in favor of lotteries and vapid escapes. Twenty years later, in Jihad vs. McWorld, Benjamin Barber noted that the tsunami was prompting violent reactions of a less libertarian, more communally organized sort abroad. \"They're fanatics, crazed and murderous,\" we thought then. But look at us now, another 20 years on. The relentless, ever-more intimate dissolution of social discipline and comity has subjected Americans of all creeds and colors to levels violence and anarchy that we thought only racism, religious fanaticism, and \"mental illness\" could generate. The truth, as I learned while covering such shootings as the Long Island Railroad massacre of 1993, is that the deranged are sometimes attuned more acutely to signals being sent subliminally by powerful social engines than are those of us who can still filter them out. Hunger for something better isn't restricted only to the insane. A liberal capitalist republic has to rely on its citizens to uphold voluntarily certain republican virtues and beliefs that neither the liberal state nor markets themselves do much to nourish or defend. The liberal state can't do it because it's not supposed to judge too harshly between one way of life and another. Markets can't do it because their very genius is to approach investors and consumers as narrowly self-interested actors in market exchanges. That leaves republican citizen-leadership to be nourished all the more intensively somehow, in what we call civil-society -- the very schools, colleges, churches, civic associations, sports programs, that markets and our market-conquered government are handing over increasingly to markets alone, in ways reported every day in these pages. For those of us not yet too ill to bear these sicknesses and their cures, the cure begins in recognizing that a more vigorous, truly republican government, far from being our enemy, is our only protection and guide to navigating these tsunamis. In the American republic, the enemy hasn't been government censors but the commercial sensors that are groping and grouping us. A bought government isn't far behind them, of course, and maybe only a new politics that's more global than national can deflect or even channel the riptides. But, for starters, those of us who miss ordered republican liberty should stop imagining that we can reconcile it with knee-jerk obedience to every whim and riptide of the casino-like financed, consumer-bamboozling juggernaut that is dissolving republican virtues and sovereignty before our eyes, under our feet, and, yes, in our lower viscera.

        "articles": "Joe Biden is a man looking for his moment. Behind those famous aviators, he’s surveying the landscape to see if 2020 might just be his year to fulfill his presidential dreams. Biden has already run for president twice. Although he didn’t run in 2016, he thinks he could have won that race. When Hillary Clinton lost, she was heavily criticized for not having a populist economic message that could have reached the working-class white voters who swung over to Donald Trump. Those voters are the speciality of the former vice president, who was born in the Rust Belt city of Scranton, Pennsylvania. When he represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate, Biden was known for taking Amtrak to and from Washington, just like the regular people. Biden is now wondering if 2020 may be his time. “I’m not closing the door. I’ve been around too long and I’m a great respecter of fate, but who knows what the situation is going to be a year and a half from now,” he said Tuesday. According to Politico, Biden has also privately been telling people that as of now, he doesn’t see anyone besides himself who could stop Trump from winning a second term. But 2020 may not be Biden’s year. While he is better than many other Democrats at offering up economic populism, there are other rising movements for which he isn’t well positioned to be the face of the party. Clinton lost. And with her defeat went many people’s hope that the nation would finally have its first female president. Afterward, women ― some of whom had supported Clinton and some who did not ― launched a resistance movement to push back on Trump’s policies and get more politically engaged. Record numbers of women are now running for office. The movement has extended beyond politics. Men in entertainment, media, business and other areas are finally being held accountable for sexist behavior. From former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly to producer Harvey Weinstein to comedian Louis C.K., men are losing their jobs after years of having sexually harassed or assaulted women with impunity. Biden is the wrong guy to bear the standard of any party purporting to speak for the victims of unaccountable power. In many ways, Anita Hill launched the movement against sexual harassment in 1991. Then a 35-year-old law professor, she publicly accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of having sexually harassed her when she worked for him. She faced a Senate Judiciary Committee composed entirely of white men. Although the Senate went on to confirm Thomas anyway, women around the country were captivated by her testimony. For the first time on national television, a woman was describing what so many of them faced every day in their jobs. “I’ve seen movements come and go. And some are quite powerful. I’ve not seen something like this. And I’m hoping that [it will] bring lasting change,” Hill told CNN last week on the progress that has been made since her testimony. Hill has previously said she doesn’t believe her allegations against Thomas received the consideration they deserved. There were other women who were ready to support her allegations, but they were never allowed to testify before the Judiciary Committee. The man who could have changed that was Biden, who served as chair of the committee in 1991. In the years since, he has publicly presented himself as Hill’s ally, but she made clear in an interview with HuffPost in 2014 that she believes the senator let her down. “There were three women who were ready and waiting and subpoenaed to be giving testimony about similar behavior that they had experienced or witnessed. He failed to call them,” Hill said. “There also were experts who could have given real information as opposed to the misinformation that the Senate was giving ... and helped the public understand sexual harassment. He failed to call them.” Biden told The New York Times two days before Hill was set to testify that he began by assuming that Thomas was innocent ― and, as it follows, by assuming that Hill was lying. “I must start off with a presumption of giving the person accused the benefit of the doubt,” Biden said. “I must seek the truth and I must ask straightforward and tough questions, and in my heart I know if that woman is telling the truth it will be almost unfair to her. On the other hand, if I don’t ask legitimate questions, then I am doing a great injustice to someone who might be totally innocent. It’s a horrible dilemma because you have two lives at stake here.” Since that time, Biden has built a long record of championing women’s rights. As vice president, he sought to address the scourge of sexual assault on college campuses and fought to make the matter a priority in the Obama administration. But part of his record remains the way he treated Hill. And for that, he has never fully apologized. Instead, on Monday, he said he felt bad that Hill felt she had been mistreated ― but he still insisted he was her champion. “I feel really badly that she didn’t feel like the process worked, but I tell you what, I said something at the time that proved to be right,” Biden said. “I said this is going to be the start of a fundamental change of what constitutes harassment in the workplace and people are going to begin to change.” Biden was correct. But it was in large part because of the way Hill was treated and the way he handled the hearing that people started talking. Women saw Hill go up against the white men on the Senate Judiciary Committee ― who were either unsympathetic to what she had gone through or simply didn’t come to her assistance ― and decided that they needed to change the face of Congress. In response, a record number of women ran for Congress in 1992. And two new female senators finally took seats on the Judiciary Committee ― but not without a misstep by Biden. After then-Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) won her party’s Senate primary, the chairman hand-delivered to her a dozen red roses with the note, “Welcome to the Senate Judiciary Committee.” News reports at the time described the moment in highly gendered language ― that Biden had tried to “woo” Boxer but was “scorned” and that Biden had gone “courting” while the new female senators played “hard to get.” Boxer ultimately chose not to join the committee. Biden also continues to maintain ― as he did in his remarks Monday ― that he wanted the other women to testify on behalf of Hill. He claimed that they didn’t want to do so and that they would have undercut Hill’s testimony. That is not, however, the version of events that Hill and her legal team remember, as HuffPost has reported. They believe that Biden, like the other senators at the time, simply wanted to finish up Thomas’ confirmation hearing and move on ― even if it meant Hill would get the short end of the stick. Today, part of Biden’s schtick is that he’s Uncle Joe. He’s the jovial guy who can go into a bar and connect with anyone there. During the Obama administration, his ability to glad-hand and connect with people in an entertaining way was on full display every two years when he greeted the new senators and their families as they were sworn in. He’d schmooze and make jokes with little kids and elderly relatives alike. His behavior also had more patronizing undercurrents. A big part of his act was remarking on the attractiveness of women, young and old. He would comment on how pretty young women were and warn their fathers to keep the guys away. Many people found this behavior charming. He wasn’t stiff like some politicians. He grabbed people’s hands, put his arm around them and even kissed people on the cheek. But it’s clear some people were uncomfortable. The teenage daughter of Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), for example, visibly cringed and pulled away when Biden whispered in her ear and kissed her on the head. In 2015, when Biden put his arms on the wife of Defense Secretary Ash Carter at Carter’s swearing-in ceremony, people noticed how uncomfortable the moment looked. There are plenty of other examples. New York Magazine even had a slideshow of them called “9 Times Joe Biden Creepily Whispered in Women’s Ears.” In 2015, conservative columnist Byron York wrote about Biden’s handsy ways, questioning whether his gestures were appropriate. “Do the incidents add up to anything? Assume that all of Biden’s gestures were entirely innocent, just Joe being Joe,” York wrote. “Still, in today’s society, sexual harassment complaints have been lodged for less. Biden’s behavior gives critics plenty of ammunition and puts supporters in a difficult position. Why is that kind of stuff OK when the vice president does it and cringe-making when it’s the overly-friendly guy in the office?” Biden has clearly been a champion for women’s rights in his policies. Even advocates who criticized his conduct during the Hill testimony say he is today one of their strongest allies. He has evolved ― but so have his party and the country. And the newly energized women under the Democratic tent may not want a relic from the pre-woke era to be their standard-bearer. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "It was ten days after Election Day and most liberals were still in full blown crisis mode, wading their way through the fever dream of the post-Trump victory world. The week since the unthinkable had happened had been a whirlwind; the rallies, the recounts, the sense of chaos, loss, and most of all, deep uncertainty. What was certain, however, was the dreamy vision of a progressive American identity many had been so sure of the morning of November 8th had been snuffed out, quite literally overnight. The liberal vision of the election as a significant step towards a more perfect union, the glorious symbolism of the first woman president succeeding the first black president, the long awaited relish of defeating Trump himself, it was all gone. And in its wake was little more than brooding, self-affirmative groupthink about a flawed, bigoted America resistant to progress and pluralism. It was against this backdrop that Saturday Night Live, long a bastion of urban progressivism and fresh off months of mercilessly mocking of Trump and his team, aired “The Bubble.” The sketch detailed an eponymous planned community for liberals ― or “like-minded freethinkers ― and no one else” ― to seek refuge from the ravages of Trump’s America. To borrow from a successful SNL character, “The Bubble” has everything: wine bars, raw milk, and WiFi that only connects to liberal blogs. In short, the sketch is chock full of small digs at the modern stereotypes of American liberals. But it goes even deeper. At one point, one of the community’s fictional spokesmen, a white man in Warby Parker glasses, declares that its members “don’t see color, but celebrate it,” prompting an eye-roll from his black female cohort. At another, the starting rate for a one-bedroom apartment is mentioned to be $1.9 million. Even more significant than its playful parody of liberal idiosyncrasies is its nudging at white liberals on the more discomforting (and more politically relevant) issues of their racial insensitivity and economic privilege, suggesting they are not quite as egalitarian and open-minded as they believe. Coming on the heels of an election whose shock outcome was attributed by many in the media to the supposed insularity of urban and progressive communities, the skit was widely circulated and well-received - across conservative media in particular. But lost in much of the post-November conversation about ideological provincialism, and conservatives’ celebration of liberals being pilloried for their own, is the stark difference in how the left and right views and attends to their own bubbles. The release this month of Jordan Peele’s cinematic tour de force, Get Out, underscores the gaping, and growing, gap between liberals and conservatives’ ability to critique, confront, and laugh at their own imperfections. To call Get Out “racially charged” would be an understatement. From the get-go, the film, premised on a black man meeting the family and entering the world of his white girlfriend, is racially volted, with the very opening scene alluding to Trayvon Martin’s killing. It is a testament to Peele’s distinct talent as an artist that even as the the film descends into a frenzied, bizarre thriller it still manages to incorporate elements of satire, subtlety, and comic relief. Tracking closely with that descent is the tone and breadth of the film’s statement on race. While racial discrimination and insensitivity are present from early in the film, they initially come exclusively from expected sources ― Baby Boomer parents, white male police officers. The film is too laden with symbolism and meaning to fully address here, but there is one moment that particularly sticks out. While there are several big “reveals,” the most thrilling comes when it is revealed that Rose ― the white girlfriend who had theretofore been distinct from her family and friends’ racism ― is directly complicit in the racial subjugation plot of her family. The moment encapsulates the clear message underlying Get Out: that many, even most, of the ostensibly “woke,” craft-beer drinking liberals that populate SNL’s Bubble do in fact reside on the same spectrum of racial oppression as the red state rubes from which they created the community to seek refuge. In itself, the delivery of this message by Peele is a watershed moment in American culture. Never before has such a message been given as big a megaphone or received as strong an affirmation (the film enjoys a 99 percent “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes). Receiving less attention but even more significant than the film’s content itself is what it tells us about bubbles and insularity. Given the film’s entire message is a strong criticism of progressives, in particular white progressives, it is significant it has been received positively by liberal critics and audiences alike. Get Out is the biggest indication yet that, for all the “snowflake” flak they get, American liberals choose to both create and expose themselves to artistic content that critiques themselves ― on some of the most emotional and explosive social issues, no less. Indeed, once one gets past the meme of liberal insularity and sensitivity, it becomes clear that the entire narrative is dubious at best and utterly fallacious at worst. Think for a second about the last television show or movie created by, directed at, and critical of conservatives. You’ll ponder in vain. They simply do not exist. Many on the right would indignantly protest that they are underrepresented in the studios and boardrooms of Hollywood and Manhattan, and this is at least partially true. But the past few years have seen a veritable explosion in conservative media. Mike Huckabee, for example, has produced nearly a dozen movies, including The Gift of Life, God’s Not Dead, and God’s Not Dead 2 (in case there was any ambiguity remaining). Kirk Cameron’s Saving Christmas, even after earning the dubious distinction of being ranked the worst movie of all time by IMDB, banked $2.5 million in 2014. Glenn Beck’s media flagship The Blaze is worth nearly $100 million ― and saw fit to construct a full-scale replication of the Oval Office from which Beck broadcast during the 2016 GOP primary. Just last year, Miracles from Heaven, a story of a chronically ill little girl who supposedly ascended to heaven and returned, grossed $70 million at the box office ― off a budget of $13 million. In other words, the capital is there. The tools are there. The audience is there. Conservatives simply choose not to utilize any of them to produce any content that is even remotely critical of any aspect of their ideology. Even Lena Dunham, the most reviled example of liberal decadence to the American right, looks like a bona fide Joan Rivers-Christopher Hitchens love child when compared to conservative media; her HBO opus “Girls” is itself centered around living caricatures of white, liberal millennials. The separation between conservative and liberals is only underscored when one considers the yawning gap between the mainstream acceptability of their ideologies. Per polls from the past year and a half: 57% of Americans acknowledge human activity to be a driver behind climate change, 7 in 10 Americans support Roe v. Wade, 55% support increased gun control, and a (mind boggling) 88% support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. In short, the entire modern conservative movement is organized around a series of political positions wholly out of step with middle America. Even if conservatives and liberals did live in equivalent “bubbles,” the latter would still be less isolated given they are overwhelmingly more in touch with the center of American society. The bottom line: despite their frequent denigration of liberal “safe spaces,” and “sensitivity,” it is demonstrably true that conservatives live overwhelmingly more homogenous and insulated lives. The position du jour of many effete elites ― that conservatives and liberals alike exist in equally aloof “two Americas” ― flies in the face of all evidence and logic. In Trump’s America, the left is producing and processing media that examines everything from innocuous idiosyncrasies to real, systemic hypocrisies. Meanwhile, conservatives are incapable of challenging even the most fantastical of statements by Trump and his advisors. From his claim of five million illegal immigrants voting in the presidential election to his recent allegation President Obama executed an intricate, secret, criminal conspiracy to wiretap him during the election, the grotesque falsehoods and absurdities of President Trump ― and the lack of pushback from any prominent conservative voice or elected official ― is a living, breathing embodiment of the unparalleled bubble around which modern conservatism is organized. As the pain and shock of the morning of November 9th showed, progressives do have blind spots. Acknowledging that does not necessitate capitulating to bigots or admitting one’s way of life is somehow inferior to a heartland conservative’s. What it does take is self-awareness, honest self-appraisal, and a firm insistence on the concept of objective reality ― not coincidentally, all characteristics modern conservatives are lacking. They are also the precise tools that, if utilized, will lead progressives, and America as a whole, to the future we envisioned the morning of November 8th. With projects like Get Out, there’s hope for that future.",

        "articles": "Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen donated $100,000 to a political fundraising group hoping to keep Republicans in control of the House of Representatives, according to financial disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission earlier this year. Allen, who owns the Seattle Seahawks and the Portland Trail Blazers, donated to Protect the House, a joint fundraising committee that then divvied up the funds to several candidates and political action committees. Some $33,900 of Allen’s donation went to the National Republican Campaign Committee, $5,000 to a PAC launched by Vice President Mike Pence and nearly a dozen congressional Republicans received $2,600. The Seattle Times was the first to report the June 14 donation, which was made public in FEC filings in July. Allen is worth a reported $20.3 billion, according to Forbes, and has made regular donations to both Republican and Democratic candidates for years. But the Times notes that his checks have traditionally swayed more towards the left, and during the 2016 election he gave $74,500 to Democrats and $52,400 to Republicans. He has already donated more than $216,000 this election cycle, with 78 percent of that figure going to Republican-affiliated efforts, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. “Paul Allen has supported both Republicans and Democrats over the years, and he will continue to support candidates on both sides of the aisle,” his spokesman, John Pinette, told The Seattle Times in a statement. Pinette also told the outlet Allen had made donations to 21 congressional Democrats. Allen, who was honored last year at an “environment and sustainability gala,” is now showing significant support for the only significant climate-science-denying party in the world. Protect the House, which has raised more than $13.7 million this election cycle, is headed by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and has attracted several notable donors in recent months. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk gave the group $38,900 earlier this year, drawing ire from many who accused the billionaire of being a GOP mega-donor, despite his protestations. Other donors to the group include business magnate Sheldon Adelson and the owner of the Houston Texans, Robert McNair. Both gave $371,500. Allen has been regularly involved in Washington state politics in recent years, spending millions to back efforts to criminalize the sale of endangered animal parts in 2015. This year, he’s donated more than $1.2 million to an effort that would tighten access to firearms in the state. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "In the wake of Alt-Right, white nationalist related murders in the past three weeks, liberal pundits continue to come out against any form of violence against fascist, terrorist groups. A popular theme to the condemnations stems from two schools of thought, consequences, and pacifism. Consequences being first that the optics of violence helps the right, but also that punching is illegal and can be damaging to those doing the punching. Legality should not play a role in stopping self-defense. Antifa and others are not trying to make it legal to punch to anyone, there is a reason they wear masks and often run away after. They are more interested in doing what is right, not what is legal. And yes, they know the legal ramifications of their actions and are willing to take the risk. They are putting their own freedoms on the line for the greater good. Violence is not being sought, but rather implemented when it is the only form of defense against a violent organization calling for the mass extermination of millions of people. When it comes to optics, we can use the punching of Richard Spencer on January, 20, as an example. In Spencer’s own words he was terrified after being assaulted, he planned to attend the Women’s March the weekend after the inauguration and didn’t show up out of fear for his safety. Spencer was already a public figure who was punched while being interviewed by an international television station, but the message was sent to his followers. That message is that they are not safe to stand in the streets and spread their message of genocide. Not punching him would have shown him he is safe to stand on the street espousing his abhorrent views, without consequence. Professor George Ciccariello-Maher, in an interview with Abolition Journal, had this to say about the punching of Spencer: Don’t be fooled into believing the Alt-Right is only taking up violence because someone punched Spencer. The alt-right has long been preparing for war, they are holding training courses and teaching each other how to make weapons to bring to rallies. They are doing so, not only to protect themselves from Antifa but also attack them, all under the guise of “free speech rights.” They understand that people mobilizing to deplatform them is a threat to any attempt that they have to organize, and thus are doing everything they can to carve out space for themselves. Unfortunately, it appears that when these neo-Nazi fascists show up armed in towns like Berkeley, California, many liberals seem to believe the best way to counter them is to stay home and bring them no attention. Recently, in Portland, Oregon, a man was shouting anti-Muslim slurs at two teens on a train. Upset by what they were witnessing, several men approached the man to stop him. This man was carrying a knife and slashed their throats. The Southern Poverty Law Center discovered that this man empathized with Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City Bomber, was pro-Hitler and Nazi ideologies, and anti-semitic. A spokesman from SPLC has emphasized that, while standing up for others can do wonders and diffuse a situation, it is best to leave any type of confrontation to the police. This man, a white nationalist terrorist, was harassing someone, armed, and obviously ready to kill. Waiting for the police, who more often than not protect alt-right white supremacists, especially in Portland with a long history of systematic racism. Two heroes stepped up because it was the right thing to do. Standing by and doing nothing is to condone such violence. They lost their lives saving a woman who very well could have lost hers at his very hands. You can’t “leave any type of confrontation to the police,” as the SPLC suggests. It’s unrealistic to think, with their history of racism, they would do much to help the Muslim victim and would instead aid the oppressor. Sure, the little old lady on the train should probably call 911 instead of intervening, but any able-bodied person should step in and defend the victims. Liberals ran to the store to buy safety pins after the election to show their solidarity and defense of such victims, and yet we should stand aside and let this harassment continue? If we stand by and do nothing, we are making the streets a safe place for them to spread these ideas. We didn’t end slavery by standing aside, we fought slavers. This is where these misguided liberals turn to pacifism and bring up the Civil Rights movement and its use of non-violence around Martin Luther King, Jr. Yes, King was non-violent, yet he refused to condemn violence and riots. “It is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard,” King said weeks before his assassination. King did famously disagree with Malcolm X on the use of violence, but to say that violence didn’t play a huge role in the Civil Rights movement is simply naive. That ignores the amazingly important role Malcolm played in the movement, or the Black Panthers, or the thousands if not more, that gave their lives fighting against an abusive and oppressive police state. Non-violence sounds wonderful, but it’s not always possible. Liberalism fetishizes non-violence. Again, Ciccariello-Maher: Sadly, liberals paint a whitewashed revisionist version of King’s legacy. They stopped listening after “I have a dream,” and ignore the reality of the situation. At the time King was accused of provoking violence through his tactics. King wasn’t an idiot, he knew he would provoke state violence and the community would respond. To call him totally non-violent is simply ignorant. It is also important to note that it is time and time again it is white liberals who are condemning the actions of violence among not only the Civil Rights Movement but also the anti-fascist movement. White liberals who came into institutionalized power through centuries of violence against people of color and other minority groups now demand those same groups ask nicely for their freedoms. Ask yourself when white men have ever taken something without violence? The United States was formed on the violent takeover of Natives. The country was built on the backs of Africans violently taken from their homes in Africa. Slavery was defended through violent means, and the rights of those later freed were fought against through violence such as public lynchings carried about by civilians and police. And all of that barely scratches the surface of white violence against marginalized groups. Why would white men be afraid of the Alt-Right? They have the least amount to lose should the alt-right movement win further power and begin to realize their goals of ethnic cleansing, yet in the face of continued violence and terrorism, these liberals continue to dictate how the most marginalized of communities must react. They did the same when people took to the streets in Ferguson, and they are doing the same now as people take the streets around the country to combat these injustices. Liberals need to wake up to the reality they are facing and heap praise and solidarity onto those willing to risk everything for the greater good. Antifa and others like them are calculated self-defensive actions against a rising threat of greater violence and mass extermination. We know the end goals of these fascist, neo-Nazi groups and we must stop them before it’s too late and before more lives are lost. This post originally appeared on It’s Going Down.

        "articles": "Western news media is reporting a possible Russian intelligence purge and mole hunt by Vladimir Putin in December, as a response to the “Golden Showers” blackmail dossier CNN and Buzzfeed reported in January. According to USA Today, Putin has black bagged and arrested three other high-ranking Russian intelligence officials, as well as the head of the top cybersecurity firm in Russia. This weekend The Telegraph reports that ex-KGB Chief Oleg Erovinkin was found dead in his Lexus after previously being the top subordinate of Putin's Igor Sechin, an oligarch who runs Russia’s state owned Roseneft oil company. This story is part of the continued fallout from Buzzfeed's release of the \"Golden Showers\" raw intelligence dossier, which has likely sparked the Russian President's lethal retaliation against one member of his own, inner circle. The Daily Mail reports: What's interesting about these news reports of Putin's retaliation, is that they're all emerging a month after the ex-KGB Chief's death, and when Putin's black bag arrests took place, which means that they happened in late-December. The public revelation of the \"Golden Showers\" news was released afterward. The Telegraph reported one expert's blog post linking the dossier to the deceased Ex-KGB Chief: News analysis suggests the following; that America's intelligence agencies may have used the dossier as a Canary Trap, testing the Trump administration's ability to keep a national security matter secret by handing him a version or several of the classified document and observing the real world responses of those discussed in the trap's documents. CNN reported the dossier's existence first on January 10th. If Putin reacted to the dossier's revelation of leaks in his inner circle, and if America's intelligence agencies did brief Donald Trump in early December, then likely would have shared word with his National Security Advisor Gen. Matt Flynn about the infamous dossier, and perhaps with others. Flynn’s son was unceremoniously dismissed from the Transition Team, but his association with the official business of hiring the federal government highlights the Trump administration’s inclinations towards nepotism. In particular, Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn has been reportedly in close contact with the Russian Ambassador, at the same time that President Obama enacted sanctions, and expelled two major diplomatic missions in late-December, and the FBI has listened to those calls, with one division proclaiming them innocent to the Washington Post. With compartmentalization, it’s impossible to know if the FBI agent who commented is actually on the investigation. An investigation could target numerous other transition team officials or Trump associates because widespread reports indicated that the Trump team used a private, unsecured telephone to have conversations with world leaders since early November. Even Russian official state propaganda announced a call between Trump and Putin in mid-November, so one can reasonably conclude that there were not multiple lines of communication between the Transition Team and the Kremlin soon after the election. On the eve of Trump's inauguration, six federal agencies - including the FBI and CIA - announced with anonymity to the New York Times that they were listening to intercepted communications. They named three obvious Trump regime players with Russian ties in a media leak intended to protect their investigation from being ordered closed by one of its targets. The New York Times report from those agencies revealed the outlines of their plainly massive investigation but is a safe assumption as any that the real targets - in this case, potentially Ret. Gen. Flynn, who is the single person most responsible for managing Trump's Russia relationship identified by the media to date - would not be publicly fingered. In fact, one might infer that Flynn may have been intentionally omitted or comments made in the opposit, for the sake of making he or others being closely watched by law enforcement and intelligence agencies to feel even more secure to act. It is important to note too, that Trump himself is not legally immune in any way for any of his acts before assuming the office of President, nor is he exempt from criminal law violations if he commits a crime while in office. Trump's transition team very publicly end-ran official channels to hold their direct, high-level foreign diplomatic discussions. A federal law called the Logan Act prohibits private citizens from conducting foreign affairs, a category of people which includes the legally meaningless title of President-elect. There was nothing legally stopping the FBI claiming probable cause, and obtaining a warrant from the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in secret, and then listening to those phone calls between foreign leaders - many in countries where Donald Trump holds conflicting business interests - the man who would lead America against all enemies foreign and domestic, with a man who spent two months obsessively sending love tweets to V. Putin before being sworn in as President. The revelations of Putin's retaliation against his inner circle are a key sign in the ongoing war of spies between Russia and the United States, which might indirectly validate the contents of the \"Golden Showers\" dossier, and could give further clues to the true nature and depth of Donald Trump's extensive ties to the Russian regime.

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- The House Republican version of the new Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) would dramatically roll back confidentiality protections for abused immigrant women, make it more difficult for undocumented witnesses to work with law enforcement officials, and eliminate a pathway to citizenship for witnesses who cooperate with police on criminal cases. The provisions are tucked into a bill that reauthorizes the act, and have received scant media attention. But the legislation is picking up steam in the House. The bill, officially sponsored by freshman Rep. Sandy Adams (R-Fla.), has the backing of the full House leadership, and is headed for a vote in the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is typically a bipartisan affair lacking in contention. This year, however, Republicans are pressing for significant changes that would weaken protections for victims of domestic violence, arguing that the current law is being taken advantage of by undocumented immigrants looking for legal citizenship. The author of the rollback, Adams, was herself a victim of domestic violence, which House Republicans hope will inoculate it from attacks by groups who work with abused immigrant women. In 1994, VAWA addressed a problem faced by abused immigrant women who are married to citizens or legal residents. In some cases, husbands would use their control over their victims' immigration status as a tool of abuse, refusing to sign the proper paperwork or threatening to revoke it. The act created a \"self-petitioning\" process that allows such women to confidentially apply for protected immigration status on their own. Protections for immigrant women have been strengthened in subsequent reauthorizations of the bill. That process is managed by a specific branch of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services based in Vermont, where officials are highly trained in secrecy and in dealing with domestic violence situations. Extreme precautions are taken to assure that the victim's identity or action is not revealed to the abuser, for obvious reasons. The Republican bill would eliminate that confidentiality and require women to go to the closest immigration office. It would allow the officer, not specifically trained in domestic violence response, to reach out to and inform the abusive partner that the alleged victim is applying for immigration status. House Republicans say that some women have taken advantage of the confidentiality by fraudulently claiming abuse to acquire residency status. Victims who are not committing fraud, however, will now be exposed to retaliatory violence. What's more, most undocumented immigrants prefer to operate under the government's radar, and prefer as little contact with federal immigration authorities as possible. It's not obvious that embarking on an elaborate fraud that involves these authorities is the most attractive option for undocumented immigrants already in the country. Persuading victims of domestic violence to seek protection can often be a daunting challenge, advocates say, and the new House rules would only make it that much more difficult. Jennifer Podkul, who works with immigrant women who have been victims of violence as a program officer at the Women's Refugee Commission, said a provision in the law that would limit reporting time could be particularly damaging. That part of the House bill would limit the period of time for domestic violence to be reported in order to receive protection to 60 days -- a short period considering the lack of information many victims have about immigration law. Some undocumented women don't realize victim protections actually exist until they are fighting deportation proceedings and consult an immigration lawyer, Podkul said. Beyond that, she said the proposed provision is an unnecessary restriction for a protection that is already fairly limited. \"It's a fix to something that's not a problem,\" she said. \"There are so few people that get these benefits anyway, especially in VAWA.\" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) expressed concern about fraud during debate over the Senate bill, which does not include the House provisions. \"The one hearing the Judiciary Committee held presented testimony that fraud exists in the VAWA-self petitioning process. We heard from victims who fell in love with foreign nationals, sponsored them for residency in the United States, only to be accused of abuse so that the foreign national could get a green card,\" Grassley said. The GOP bill would also change the standard of evidence from \"preponderance of evidence\" to \"clear and convincing\" -- a higher standard than that faced by asylum seekers or other types of immigration petitioners. But eliminating the Vermont-based office that handles these issues could undermine the ability to detect fraud. Those agents are highly-trained on these issues -- meaning they are also best-suited to catch fraud, a Democratic aide who was not authorized to speak on the issue told HuffPost. The office also isn't the rubber stamp provider that it's portrayed to be by Republicans; it already rejected 32 percent of petitions in the 2011 fiscal year -- a far higher rejection rate than the average for all types of visa requests. Michelle Ortiz, director of the Lucha Project at Americans for Immigrant Justice, wrote in a HuffPost blog that she has represented women whose lives have likely been saved by self-petition process. \"I know firsthand how dangerous an abuser can be and the risks that immigrant survivors take when they courageously decide to leave their abusers. Sara's husband was so enraged that he began threatening me after he found my business card among things she had left behind,\" Ortiz writes of one client who used the process. \"Fortunately, he has never found Sara. She is now a lawful permanent resident. If Sara had not had the promise of confidentiality she likely would not have taken the steps necessary to free herself from her abuser.\" The bill also targets crime witnesses. Under current law, undocumented immigrants who assist police or prosecutors during an investigation are eligible to apply for legal immigration status -- known as a U visa -- as long as law enforcement certifies that the person was helpful. The new law requiring that the crime be reported within 60 days would only allow certification while the case is open -- which is precisely the time when law enforcement would likely not want to certify the petition, worried that the witness might stop cooperating. And even if they did cooperate, under the Republican bill victims would no longer have a path to U.S. citizenship if granted a U-Visa, putting them in legal limbo. Republicans say the controversy over changing provisions that impact immigrants is based on disagreements between the House and Senate over how VAWA should be reauthorized -- disagreements which have been blown out of proportion because Democrats are trying to play politics. Todd Winer, a spokesman for Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), who supports the bill and serves as vice chair of the House Republican Conference, said the controversy boils down to Democrats trying to use the issue for political gain. \"There have been and continue to be some legitimate differences about certain aspects of the bill, relatively minor aspects of the bill, not the whole bill,\" Winer said. \"The reason why this controversy emerged in the first place is that Democrats were using it as a campaign issue.\" Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "America may be exceptional in many ways, but it also tops the charts of a new, troubling ranking. The U.S. has more low-paying jobs than any other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an economic group of 34 developed countries, according to a research note released by Morgan Stanley on Monday. Economists Ellen Zentner and Paula Campbell based their analysis on the OECD Economic Outlook Report, which documents employment and labor trends in each member nation. The OECD defines \"low-paying\" as jobs that earn less than two-thirds of a country's median income. On average, around 16 percent of jobs in OECD countries are considered low-paying. In the U.S., over 25 percent of all jobs qualify as such. See the chart below, from Morgan Stanley: The ranking reflects America's problem with income equality. Even though the U.S. has one of the highest household median incomes in the world (about $44,000 compared to roughly $10,000 worldwide), there's a wide gulf between those making much more than the median income and those making much less. According to the Morgan Stanley economists, income inequality is stifling U.S. economic growth because low-income Americans aren't able to spend enough to boost the greater economy. Wages will need to rise so that households can buy more things. \"Stronger growth in wages and salaries is essential,\" wrote Zentner and Campbell. \"It would help households spend more broadly across the income spectrum.\" The OECD recommends that all its members have a \"sensible\" minimum wage, increase progressive taxation and \"scale up\" in-work benefits to address income inequality.",

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- A lobbying firm has prepared a memo offering advice to its Wall Street clients to help them manage any political fallout from Occupy Wall Street, warning that Republicans may turn on big banks, at least in public, altering the political ground for years to come. It is one of the first clear signs that the movement may be starting to trouble the moneyed elite. The memo, first reported by MSNBC's Chris Hayes, host of the show \"Up with Chris Hayes,\" was written by the firm Clark, Lytle, Geduldig, Cranford and addressed to one of its Wall Street clients. It runs four pages long and is set to be sent on Thanksgiving. The first two graphs of the memo, provided by MSNBC to The Huffington Post, express angst over the idea that the movement could mean \"more than just short-term discomfort for Wall Street firms\" and has \"the potential to have very long-lasting political, policy and financial impacts on the companies in the center of the bullseye.\" The paragraphs read in full: Leading Democratic party strategists have begun to openly discuss the benefits of embracing the growing and increasingly organized Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement to prevent Republican gains in Congress and the White House next year. We have seen this process of adopting extreme positions and movements to increase base voter turnout, including in the 2005-2006 immigration debate. This would mean more than just short-term discomfort for Wall Street firms. If vilifying the leading companies of this sector is allowed to become an unchallenged centerpiece of a coordinated Democratic campaign, it has the potential to have very long-lasting political, policy and financial impacts on the companies in the center of the bullseye. It shouldn't be surprising that the Democratic party or even President Obama's re-election team would campaign against Wall Street in this cycle. However the bigger concern should be that Republicans will no longer defend Wall Street companies -- and might start running against them too. The lobbying firm, a high-powered shop with an array of clients from across the political spectrum, declined to comment. On its website, the firm notes that it \"combines sophisticated high-level strategic thinking with robust ground-level relationships established over decades with key members of Congress and their staff, Administration officials.\" Joshua Stephens, who has participated in the occupy movement in New York City, says the memo worries might be misplaced or potentially obsolete. \"The danger is not whether or not politicians will defend these institutions. My fear wouldn't be that,\" he said. \"My fear would be that the politicians that come to their aid will be increasingly irrelevant...That's the real threat and that's where things are going.\" Watch the \"Up with Chris Hayes\" segment on the memo below: Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy Ryan Grim contributed reporting to this story.

The poll, conducted by Pew Research Center, found that 63 percent of Republican millennials -- defined as those born between 1981 and 1996 -- feel that the use of marijuana should be legal. Support among Democratic millennials was even higher, at 77 percent. While a majority of Democrats in all age groups born after 1945 support marijuana legalization, the only Republican age group to favor legal marijuana was millennials. Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., all passed ballot measures to legalize recreational marijuana last November. The poll results came the same week the measures went into effect in Alaska and Washington. Oregon's legalization is set to go into effect later this year. The months since Washington voted to legalize marijuana have been filled with debates and threats as congressional Republicans attempted to thwart the law. Ultimately, the required 30-day period for congressional review expired, and legalization went into effect. Pew Research Center notes that the contrast between Republican millennials and their elder counterparts is comparable to their positions on same-sex marriage: a March poll showed that 61 percent of Republican millennials favor legalizing gay marriage.

        "articles": "Gun stores nationwide are selling out of bump stocks, a device used by the Las Vegas shooter that allows a semiautomatic gun to fire as quickly as a machine gun. Police said Stephen Paddock, the 64-year-old gunman, had outfitted 12 of his firearms with bump stocks, which he used to fire hundreds of rounds into a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers Sunday from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Hundreds were injured and at least 59 people were killed, including Paddock, who died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. While some retailers, such as Walmart and Cabela’s, discontinued the sale of bump stocks following the shooting, others couldn’t keep up with the demand. At least six online gun retailers examined by Newsweek had sold out of the device this week. Slide Fire, a Texas-based manufacturer of bump stocks, sold out of the devices within days of the mass shooting. The company posted a note to customers on its website: “We have decided to temporarily suspend taking new orders in order to provide the best service with those already placed.” Another Texas-based bump stock manufacturer, Bump Fire Systems, noted on its Facebook page on Tuesday that its website couldn’t handle the amount of interest it had received this week. “Currently our servers are down due to high traffic volume,” read a post on Bump Fire Systems’ Facebook page. “Please be patient, our IT Dept is currently working on the issue as fast as possible.” Dozens of people commented on the post, leaving messages ranging from condemnation over the sales to desperate inquiries about when it would be possible to purchase the devices. Neither Bump Fire Systems nor Slide Fire immediately returned HuffPost’s requests for comment. “Will I be able to order sometime soon?” one Facebook user asked. “I want to get one before there is a push to make them illegal.” Jay Roberts, a 43-year-old municipal worker in Ohio, said he bought his first bump stock in 2012 because he wanted to try out a full automatic weapon, but “couldn’t afford the outrageous price” of one. He fired through two magazines using his new bump stock before putting it in his safe, he said, where he’s left it ever since. “The bump stock is nothing more than a novelty item,” Roberts told HuffPost in an email on Thursday. “It is very impractical and would take quite a bit of training to be able to even remotely wield one as a viable weapon.” “Also, you do not even need a bump stock to fire rapidly,” he said, noting that he ordered another one this week in case the government issues a ban against the device. “[A] simple YouTube search will show you that.” While fully automatic weapons are strictly regulated under federal law, bump stocks offer gun owners a relatively easy ― and cheap ― way to get around such restrictions. The devices, which could be purchased online for as little as $100, enable a user to fire hundreds of rounds per minute. Slide Fire and Bump Fire Systems were uncertain they would be able to legally sell bump stocks when they first developed them. But in 2010, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, responding to an inquiry from Slide Fire, noted that bump stocks were not regulated under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act. Gun sales (and, in turn, gun stocks) typically rise after mass shootings, as many eager buyers worry the government will pass legislation that would significantly crack down on gun ownership and use. But lawmakers rarely do so, even when children are slaughtered at their elementary school or churchgoers are gunned down during Bible study. Still, Sunday’s mass shooting ― the deadliest in modern U.S. history ― has renewed debate over gun control on Capitol Hill. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a longtime proponent of stricter gun control legislation, introduced a bill on Wednesday that would ban the sale and possession of bump stocks. “The only reason to modify a gun is to kill as many people as possible in as short a time as possible,” Feinstein told reporters. The bill, titled the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act, currently has 26 co-sponsors and would go into effect 180 days after its passage. Though zero Republican lawmakers have pledged their support, some have said they might be open to the idea of banning bump stocks. “I’ll look at it for sure,” Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) said. “You can’t buy a chain-fed machine gun in the United States today. There’s a reason for that. And I want to make sure that nobody has access to that if that’s the law of the land.” On Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) became the highest-ranking Republican to call for scrutiny of bump stocks. “Look, I didn’t know what they were until this week, and I’m an avid sportsman, and so we are quickly coming up to speed with this,” Ryan said in an interview with MSNBC’s Hugh Hewitt. “So to turn a semiautomatic to fully automatic is something we have to look into.” Even the National Rifle Association, the massive gun rights advocacy group that has spent millions of dollars lobbying against gun control legislation, places some restrictions on bump stocks at its own headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia. The gun range there doesn’t allow the use of such devices, an NRA employee confirmed to HuffPost on Thursday. The NRA did not immediately answer HuffPost’s request for comment about why or when this rule was implemented. Despite Sunday’s mass shooting and the unparalleled levels of gun violence in the U.S., many gun enthusiasts are none too pleased by the prospect of tighter gun laws. They claim that more gun restrictions likely wouldn’t have prevented Paddock’s attack. Roberts said he believes automatic weapons should be available to anyone who “can complete a background check” and said it wouldn’t be the “American way” to shut down bump stock manufactures like Slide Fire just because some people feel they are “complicit” in mass shootings. “The problem is the guy pulling the trigger,” Roberts said. “Back in the day we had mental hospitals, where people could get treatment. They are now turned loose on the street or in prisons because of the notion that inclusion in society is a better way. I don’t agree with that.” “The problem with the animal in Vegas is that he didn’t show any signs [of mental illness], that the public knows of, so what do you do about that? I don’t have an answer,” Roberts added. “Complete freedom comes with risks,” he concluded. “Risks I’m ok with.” This story has been updated with a quote from Paul Ryan and information about the NRA’s restrictions on bump stocks at its gun range.",

        "articles": "Michelle Obama spoke out against the wave of anti-LGBT \"religious freedom\" bills moving through state legislatures across the country while delivering the commencement address at Jackson State University in Mississippi. \"If we fail to exercise our fundamental right to vote, then I guarantee that so much of the progress we’ve fought for will be under threat,\" the first lady said Saturday. \"Congress will still be gridlocked. Statehouses will continue to roll back voting rights and write discrimination into the law. We see it right here in Mississippi — just two weeks ago -– how swiftly progress can hurtle backward, how easy it is to single out a small group and marginalize them because of who they are or who they love.\" \"So we’ve got to stand side by side with all our neighbors –- straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender; Muslim, Jew, Christian, Hindu immigrant, Native American — because the march for civil rights isn’t just about African-Americans, it’s about all Americans,\" she added. \"It’s about making things more just, more equal, more free for all our kids and grandkids. That’s the story you all have the opportunity to write. That’s what this historic university has prepared you to do.\" The Mississippi measure, called the Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act, allows individuals and organizations to use religion as a justification to discriminate against LGBT people. More than 100 anti-LGBT measures are currently being considered across 22 states. Earlier this week, the U.K. issued a travel warning to LGBT travelers who “may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi.” The measures have also prompted a wave of boycotts of the states by businesses and entertainers. President Barack Obama also addressed the issue in a press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron over the weekend. Obama said that while the people of North Carolina and Mississippi \"are wonderful\" and that the British people should feel welcome to visit those states, “the laws that have been passed there are wrong and should be overturned.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced he's running for president in 2016. Christie told supporters of his plans in a phone call Tuesday morning, according to NBC and the AP. Christie made a public announcement Tuesday afternoon at Livingston High School, his alma mater, in Livingston, New Jersey. \"I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America,\" Christie said at the public announcement. He praised his home state during his speech, sharing how working as governor inspired him to run for president. Christie also took hits at lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, claiming a lack of productivity from Congress is giving Americans anxiety. \"Both parties have failed our country... both parties have led us to believe that America, a country that was built on compromise -- that compromise is somehow a dirty word,\" Christie said. \"We need to have the courage to choose, we need to have the courage to stand up and say 'enough,'\" Christie added. Christie, a tough-talking former federal prosecutor whose reputation for political bullying was reinforced by a George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal last year, has served as New Jersey governor since January 2010, winning election twice in a state where Democrats greatly outnumber Republicans. He notably led the state during catastrophic damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Christie's favorability rating among voters skyrocketed after he made himself visible through interviews, press conferences and tours of storm damage during the disaster. Christie focused on his state rather than the presidential election that took place days after New Jersey's shore was ravaged by the storm. HuffPost reported in November 2012 Christie turned down an invitation to appear at an event with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney days ahead of the election. Instead, Christie was seen that October praising President Barack Obama for responsiveness and \"leadership\" in the storm's aftermath. In an October 2012 interview with Fox News, Christie said he didn't \"give a damn about presidential politics\" in the wake of the storm. \"I have got a job to do here in New Jersey that is much bigger than presidential politics. And I could care less about any of that stuff,\" Christie said Christie was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association in November 2013. He worked within that role to raise money and contribute to the campaigns of Republican governors across the U.S., many of whom won in the 2014 midterm elections. While serving as chair of the governors association, Christie held prep sessions on foreign policy with officials, business leaders and academics in an attempt to ready himself for a White House run, according The Associated Press. Known for his blunt speaking style, Christie has acknowledged that he can come off brash and confrontational. \"I'm not everybody's cup of tea, but I'm not in this business to get elected to prom king. My job is to lead, and that's what I try to do,\" Christie said in 2014, according to the AP. His image suffered a major blow in 2014, when it was revealed members of his administration, including his deputy chief of staff, were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge to retaliate against a mayor who hadn't supported Christie's 2013 re-election. Dubbed \"Bridgegate,\" the controversy caused Christie, who had enjoyed high favorability ratings, to see his negatives rise sharply. Christie has also faced criticism for reversinghis position recently on Common Core education standards. Christie initially supported the standards but said recently that he no longer supports them because of how they've played out in his state. According to HuffPost Pollster, Christie is in the middle of the pack of GOP presidential candidates: Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed reporting.

        "articles": "The rollout was a disaster. A website that was supposed to make health insurance reform a reality still wasn't ready for use a month after the official kick-off. White House officials announced delays. Even after it went online, the website was cumbersome to navigate and riddled with problems. The year was 2005, and the Bush administration had a mess on its hands trying to roll out the President's signature reform initiative, Medicare Part D. But as Daily Beast writer Michael Tomasky points out, Democrats who opposed Pres. George W. Bush's Part D legislation made sure that once it became law, they helped their constituents access the coverage it provided. Tomasky reminds us that then-Sen. Hillary Clinton went on record saying, \"I voted against it, but once it passed I certainly determined that I would try to do everything I could to make sure that New Yorkers understood it, could access it, and make the best of it.\" It's a statement that seems remarkable today, if only because it is a cooperative, even-handed commitment to value people over politics. After President Bush's Part D was signed into law, there was no scramble to the Supreme Court to try to block it, no government shutdown, no epic temper tantrum intended to derail the law. Instead, opponents such as Hillary Clinton rolled up their shirt sleeves and worked to fix Part D's technical problems and get it fully implemented. They didn't sit on the sidelines then and our union isn't doing so now. Yet a piece this week on Politico imagines - wrongly - that unions are absent from the effort to get people enrolled through HealthCare.gov. That's news to the 1.6 million members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFL-CIO). It's certainly news to Jim Dixon, an AFSCME Local 2600 member in Springfield, Ill., who is helping people access Affordable Care Act through his state's insurance exchange website. He's proud of his work to make affordable health insurance a reality for Illinois' uninsured, and we are proud of him and every AFSCME member who does the same across the country. So proud in fact that we publicly wrote about Dixon on our website on Oct. 9: \"Illinois AFSCME Members Signing Up the State's 1.8 Million Uninsured.\" It was also news to me, because on Oct. 1, I stood with other union leaders and elected officials including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and shared our union's support for the law. We wrote about that on the AFSCME website, too - \"Supporters Celebrate Kick-off of Affordable Care Act.\" Of course union support doesn't fit the narrative that right-wing ideologues desperately want to create about the Affordable Care Act. It's an inconvenient truth that union members do support the law and we stand with President Obama as he works to bring this essential reform to 48 million uninsured Americans. Every day, AFSCME members are on the frontlines in unemployment offices, emergency rooms, and every other public facility where the poor and middle class try to find a foothold in a country whose economic terrain is increasingly rocky for all but the wealthy. Our union's members know that it is wrong to deny children with pre-existing conditions the care that will keep them alive. We know that seniors need access to free cancer screenings and affordable prescriptions. We know that insurance companies need to be held accountable. As we fought for passage of the law for years, we support its full implementation now. There's no doubt HealthCare.gov was weighed down by technical problems and that there are concerns about the ACA that need to be addressed. But this doesn't mean we should abandon the crucial health care reform that is now, for the first time, the law of the land. MSNBC's Chris Matthews recently scolded the opportunists cheerleading for the demise of health care for all by crowing about the website's problems: \"It's a new rule,\" Matthews said. \"If something doesn't work, you get rid of it! If the post office is late today, let's get rid of the post office! If the plane is late an hour, get rid of airplanes! It's ridiculous!\" Consider this: In its first 24 hours, HealthCare.gov logged 4.7 million unique visits. That's a lot of Americans eager to access what was previously out of reach for them. It also underscores how unrepresentative of American interests the right-wing members of the U.S. House are. At every turn, they're trying to destroy a law that that will improve the lives of working families. Our union will do everything in our power to make sure that the law succeeds.

        "articles": "Chris Savage had had enough of Bill Clinton and his shenanigans by the time the 2000 election rolled around, and he wasn’t thrilled about putting his vice president, Al Gore, back in the White House for another four years. But as a Democrat, there was no way the 36-year-old Michigan resident was going to vote for George W. Bush either. Then, he found Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. “He was pretty convincing in terms of the things he was advocating for. And he did have some very progressive positions and ideas, so those appealed to me,” Savage recounted. He soon put a Nader sign in his yard, became politically active and was all in to send a message to the establishment. But this cycle, Savage isn’t even considering voting third party. He’s now an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter and literally works for the establishment as Democratic Party chair of Washtenaw County in Michigan. And he wants to make sure that disaffected voters know exactly what they’re doing in this election before they go pull the lever for a third-party candidate like Jill Stein of the Green Party or Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party. “I was somewhat uninformed and felt like there wasn’t that big a difference between Gore and Bush, believe it or not,” he said. “Obviously, in retrospect, it was a moronic way to look at things.” The Huffington Post spoke with Nader voters who have since figured out that the best way to fix the two-party system is to join it. They’ve worked in Democratic politics for years ― some as penance for what they did in 2000 ― and they worry that Stein voters are going to be making the same mistake they did with Nader. “If you think there’s no difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, then you’re not paying attention,” said Joe Rospars, who was the chief digital strategist for both of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns and voted for Nader in Virginia when he was 19. “I don’t think that I’m just an old person now saying what an old person would have said to me 16 years ago. ... Voting for Jill Stein in a battleground state or Gary Johnson for any reason is just not a useful way to operate the electoral system.” Nader took 2.7 percent of the vote in 2000, and there’s been a national argument ever since over whether he cost Gore the election. He received nearly 100,000 votes in Florida, a state in which Bush beat Gore by only 537 votes. People who went for Nader in 2000 have done their own soul-searching over the years, with plenty of accusations from friends that they led to things like the Iraq War. “Those of us who voted for Ralph Nader in 2000, most of us, if we had to do it over again, would not do it,” said Kurt Ehrenberg, 58, who served as Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) New Hampshire political director but now solidly backs Clinton. “You feel, in some small way, responsible for all this stuff that George W. Bush was able to do because he was elected president ― even though it was the closest race in my lifetime and there’s still some question as to whether, if all the votes had been counted, Bush would’ve won.” Jesse Berney was 25 when he voted for Nader and has since worked at the Democratic National Committee and for Clinton’s 2008 campaign. When asked if he regretted his vote, he replied, “Of course! John Roberts and Samuel Alito, the Iraq war, the huge irresponsible tax breaks, the pushing of abstinence-only education. The list goes on and on.” Berney eventually ended up creating a list that he called Bush’s “Scorecard of Evil,” summing up all the president’s objectionable actions. Many of Stein’s supporters were one-time Sanders supporters. But even though the senator himself is now out there campaigning for Clinton, not all of them are on board. Sanders’ supporters booed the senator himself at the Democratic National Convention in July when he said it was time to vote for Clinton. “It’s frustrating,” Ehrenberg said. “I try to talk to these folks about my vote for Ralph Nader and how much I regret that.” Ehrenberg and others worry that many of the younger Stein supporters have never really known a president besides Obama ― and they don’t realize how much worse it could be under a Republican president. “Part of what is going on with these voters is they’re mostly younger people who had very little experience with electoral politics before the Bernie campaign,” he said. “And their main opponent all through the primaries is Hillary Clinton. So they really continue to view Hillary Clinton as sort of the enemy when clearly, to me, and clearly if you listen to Bernie Sanders, she’s not the enemy.” “A lot of them have the luxury of having Obama for eight years,” added Irene Lin, who was 24 and living in California when she voted for Nader and has since worked on Democratic campaigns. “I think they take for granted how bad it was before. Especially when I worked on the Hill in 2005, and it was Bush and then Republicans had control of the Senate and the House and it was just miserable.” Some of these Nader-voters-turned-Democratic-operatives also said they underestimated just how bad Bush would be. They were, after all, primarily focused on the Clinton administration and devoting energy to criticizing the Democratic Party. “I think at the time, a lot of people were under the illusion he wasn’t as bad as he turned out to be,” Rospars said. “Not that I would have ever voted for him, but ...you wouldn’t have imagined that even from just a policy perspective, that it was as bad as it wound up being based on the campaign and the broader media environment during the election.” “But also as a kid, I didn’t know what the hell was going on,” he added. Some Nader supporters have officially joined the Democratic Party as elected leaders. Kyrsten Sinema, for example, worked on Nader’s presidential campaign in 2000 and is now a Democratic member of the House from Arizona. James Wolf was in college at the University of Cincinnati when he backed Nader, unhappy with NAFTA and some of Clinton’s welfare-to-work policies. “Nader really spoke to me at the time,” he said. Since his college days, he’s joined the city council in Mount Healthy, Ohio, and now serves as the Democratic mayor there. He still considers himself more liberal than both Clinton and Obama, but he said his experience has helped him better understand why it’s useful to support the top of the ticket even if the candidate isn’t perfect. “The work that [major party presidential candidates] do when they run for office helps build the voter file and helps build the party so that when I run for election, it helps people like me get elected,” he said. “And when people like me get elected at the lower level, we help grow the party from the grassroots and push it into the direction I would like to see. ... So now I really believe in changing things through the party.” “To be honest, these third-party candidates are kind of selfish,” Wolf added in a statement that probably would have shocked his college self. “Their campaigns are selfish. Because when you support Jill Stein, the money goes toward Jill Stein, and there’s no Green Party candidate in Mount Healthy, for example. ... So you’re not building any long-term momentum or movement. You’re just helping one person.” Right now, many of these Nader voters say they’re not too worried about disaffected Democrats going third party and tipping the election to Trump. But then again, most of them thought that Gore would easily win in 2000 as well. And there are indications that third-party votes will hurt Clinton more than Trump. That’s why they’re still a bit concerned. “If there are progressive or otherwise just public service-oriented people who are somehow figuring out a way to rationalize voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson,” Rospars said, “they should seek out me and the other people who you’re talking to for this piece for a conversation because I really can’t imagine how one could come to that conclusion.” Enter your email address: Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

        "articles": "There's a virus infecting our politics and right now it's flourishing with a scarlet heat. It feeds on fear, paranoia and bigotry. All that was required for it to spread was a timely opportunity -- and an opportunist with no scruples. There have been stretches of history when this virus lay dormant. Sometimes it would flare up here and there, then fade away after a brief but fierce burst of fever. At other moments, it has spread with the speed of a firestorm, a pandemic consuming everything in its path, sucking away the oxygen of democracy and freedom. Today its carrier is Donald Trump, but others came before him: narcissistic demagogues who lie and distort in pursuit of power and self-promotion. Bullies all, swaggering across the landscape with fistfuls of false promises, smears, innuendo and hatred for others, spite and spittle for anyone of a different race, faith, gender or nationality. In America, the virus has taken many forms: \"Pitchfork Ben\" Tillman, the South Carolina governor and senator who led vigilante terror attacks with a gang called the Red Shirts and praised the efficiency of lynch mobs; radio's charismatic Father Charles Coughlin, the anti-Semitic, pro-Fascist Catholic priest who reached an audience of up to 30 million with his attacks on Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the New Deal; Mississippi's Theodore Bilbo, a member of the Ku Klux Klan who vilified ethnic minorities and deplored the \"mongrelization\" of the white race; Louisiana's corrupt and dictatorial Huey Long, who promised to make \"Every Man a King.\" And of course, George Wallace, the governor of Alabama and four-time presidential candidate who vowed, \"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Note that many of these men leavened their gospel of hate and their lust for power with populism -- giving the people hospitals, schools and highways. Father Coughlin spoke up for organized labor. Both he and Huey Long campaigned for the redistribution of wealth. Tillman even sponsored the first national campaign-finance reform law, the Tillman Act, in 1907, banning corporate contributions to federal candidates. But their populism was tinged with poison -- a pernicious nativism that called for building walls to keep out people and ideas they didn't like. Which brings us back to Trump and the hotheaded, ego-swollen provocateur he most resembles: Joseph McCarthy, U.S. senator from Wisconsin -- until now perhaps our most destructive demagogue. In the 1950s, this madman terrorized and divided the nation with false or grossly exaggerated tales of treason and subversion -- stirring the witches' brew of anti-Communist hysteria with lies and manufactured accusations that ruined innocent people and their families. \"I have here in my hand a list,\" he would claim -- a list of supposed Reds in the State Department or the military. No one knew whose names were there, nor would he say, but it was enough to shatter lives and careers. In the end, McCarthy was brought down. A brave journalist called him out on the same television airwaves that helped the senator become a powerful, national sensation. It was Edward R. Murrow, and at the end of an episode exposing McCarthy on his CBS series See It Now, Murrow said: \"It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men -- not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.\" There also was the brave and moral lawyer Joseph Welch, acting as chief counsel to the U.S. Army after it was targeted for one of McCarthy's inquisitions. When McCarthy smeared one of his young associates, Welch responded in full view of the TV and newsreel cameras during hearings in the Senate. \"You've done enough,\" Welch said. \"Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?... If there is a God in heaven, it will do neither you nor your cause any good. I will not discuss it further.\" It was a devastating moment. Finally, McCarthy's fellow senators -- including a handful of brave Republicans -- turned on him, putting an end to the reign of terror. It was 1954. A motion to censure McCarthy passed 67-22, and the junior senator from Wisconsin was finished. He soon disappeared from the front pages, and three years later was dead. Here's something McCarthy said that could have come straight out of the Trump playbook: \"McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled.\" Sounds just like The Donald, right? Interestingly, you can draw a direct line from McCarthy to Trump -- two degrees of separation. In a Venn diagram of this pair, the place where the two circles overlap, the person they share in common, is a fellow named Roy Cohn. Cohn was chief counsel to McCarthy's Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the same one Welch went up against. Cohn was McCarthy's henchman, a master of dark deeds and dirty tricks. When McCarthy fell, Cohn bounced back to his hometown of New York and became a prominent Manhattan wheeler-dealer, a fixer representing real estate moguls and mob bosses -- anyone with the bankroll to afford him. He worked for Trump's father, Fred, beating back federal prosecution of the property developer, and several years later would do the same for Donald. \"If you need someone to get vicious toward an opponent,\" Trump told a magazine reporter in 1979, \"you get Roy.\" To another writer he said, \"Roy was brutal but he was a very loyal guy.\" Cohn introduced Trump to his McCarthy-like methods of strong-arm manipulation and to the political sleazemeister Roger Stone, another dirty trickster and unofficial adviser to Trump who just this week suggested that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin was a disloyal American who may be a spy for Saudi Arabia, a \"terrorist agent.\" Cohn also introduced Trump to the man who is now his campaign chair, Paul Manafort, the political consultant and lobbyist who without a moral qualm in the world has made a fortune representing dictators -- even when their interests flew in the face of human rights or official US policy. So the ghost of Joseph McCarthy lives on in Donald Trump as he accuses President Obama of treason, slanders women, mocks people with disabilities, and impugns every politician or journalist who dares call him out for the liar and bamboozler he is. The ghosts of all the past American demagogues live on in him as well, although none of them have ever been so dangerous -- none have come as close to the grand prize of the White House. Because even a pathological liar occasionally speaks the truth, Trump has given voice to many who feel they've gotten a raw deal from establishment politics, who see both parties as corporate pawns, who believe they have been cheated by a system that produces enormous profits from the labor of working men and women that are gobbled up by the 1 percent at the top. But again, Trump's brand of populism comes with venomous race-baiting that spews forth the red-hot lies of a forked and wicked tongue. We can hope for journalists with the courage and integrity of an Edward R. Murrow to challenge this would-be tyrant, to put the truth to every lie and publicly shame the devil for his outrages. We can hope for the likes of Joseph Welch, who demanded to know whether McCarthy had any sense of decency. Think of Gonzalo Curiel, the jurist Trump accused of persecuting him because of the judge's Mexican heritage. Curiel has revealed the soulless little man behind the curtain of Trump's alleged empire, the avaricious money-grubber who conned hard-working Americans out of their hard-won cash to attend his so-called \"university.\" And we can hope there still remain in the Republican Party at least a few brave politicians who will stand up to Trump, as some did McCarthy. This might be a little harder. For every Mitt Romney and Lindsey Graham who have announced their opposition to Trump, there is a weaselly Paul Ryan, a cynical Mitch McConnell and a passel of fellow travelers up and down the ballot who claim not to like Trump and who may not wholeheartedly endorse him but will vote for him in the name of party unity. As this headline in The Huffington Postaptly put it, \"Republicans Are Twisting Themselves Into Pretzels To Defend Donald Trump.\" Ten GOP senators were interviewed about Trump and his attack on Judge Curiel's Mexican heritage. Most hemmed and hawed about their presumptive nominee. As Trump \"gets to reality on things he'll change his point of view and be, you know, more responsible.\" That was Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. Trump's comments were \"racially toxic\" but \"don't give me any pause.\" That was Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Republican African-American in the Senate. And Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas? He said Trump's words were \"unfortunate.\" Asked if he was offended, Jennifer Bendery writes, the senator \"put his fingers to his lips, gestured that he was buttoning them shut, and shuffled away.\" No profiles in courage there. But why should we expect otherwise? Their acquiescence, their years of kowtowing to extremism in the appeasement of their base, have allowed Trump and his nightmarish sideshow to steal into the tent and take over the circus. Alexander Pope once said that party spirit is at best the madness of the many for the gain of a few. A kind of infection, if you will -- a virus that spreads through the body politic, contaminating all. Trump and his ilk would sweep the promise of America into the dustbin of history unless they are exposed now to the disinfectant of sunlight, the cleansing torch of truth. Nothing else can save us from the dark age of unreason that would arrive with the triumph of Donald Trump. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) claimed Wednesday night that “the Democrats are the party of the Ku Klux Klan.” Speaking on Fox News, Cruz blasted the party for its opposition to Jeff Sessions, who was confirmed as attorney general on Wednesday. Critics had accused Sessions of racial bias, among other things, but Cruz attempted to turn it around on the Democrats. “When the left doesn’t have any other arguments, they go and just accuse everyone of being a racist. It’s an ugly, ugly part of the modern Democratic Party,” he said on “America’s Newsroom.” “You look at the most racist, you look at the Dixiecrats, they were Democrats who imposed segregation, imposed Jim Crow laws, who founded the Klan,” Cruz said. “The Klan was founded by a great many Democrats.” However, historians say the KKK and its founding had nothing to do with what Cruz called the “modern Democratic Party.” PolitiFact looked into the accusation when it came up in 2013 and called it false. The KKK was indeed made up largely of Democrats in the South after the Civil War, as most whites in the South were Democrats, but it was not started by the party, historians told the website. In addition, the modern Democratic and Republican parties are not what they were in the 19th century. “The party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today,” Carole Emberton, an associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo, told PolitiFact. “Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "Jonathan Gruber, an M.I.T. economist hired by Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney to help craft health care reform, sharply criticized the Republican presidential candidate for distinguishing between his bill and President Barack Obama's in an interview with Capital New York published Wednesday. \"They're the same f***ing bill. He [Romney] just can't have his cake and eat it too,\" Gruber said. \"He can try to draw distinctions and stuff, but he's just lying. The only big difference is he didn't have to pay for his. Because the federal government paid for it. Where at the federal level, we have to pay for it, so we have to raise taxes.\" The Huffington Post's Andrea Stone reported in May that Gruber called Romney's opposition to the health care law the president signed \"largely political.\" Gruber also said Romney was \"subtly hypocritical\" and \"misleading\" for suggesting that if Massachusetts could devise its own health care law, then other states should be allowed to develop their own plans. The health care bill Romney signed and the Affordable Care Act signed by Obama have substantial similarities. Both have individual and employer mandates and subsidies, establish health insurance exchanges, allow young adults to stay on their parents' insurance and prohibit insurers from denying people based on pre-existing conditions. Romney has defended the law he signed but said that states should be able to develop their own health care laws. He favors repealing the health care law the president signed into law. Gruber is a Democrat, and told The New Yorker that Romney never asked him about his political views. He also recalled that Romney argued for the individual mandate since it would eliminate the \"free rider\" problem of uninsured patients seeking care at emergency rooms. The White House also contacted Gruber to do the economic modeling for Obama's plan. In the interview with Capital New York, Gruber also expressed frustration that the Supreme Court might decide the fate of health care on \"political grounds.\" \"It's very disturbing,\" he said. The Huffington Post's Mike Sacks reported that the high court is likely to make a decision on the constitutionality of the individual mandate at the end of June 2012.

        "articles": "President Donald Trump confirmed late Thursday that he canceled a trip to London next month to help open the new U.S. Embassy there, saying he did not support the project and that former President Barack Obama crafted a “bad deal” to see it built. “Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for ‘peanuts,’ only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars,” Trump tweeted, before continuing: “Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!” The process to move the embassy actually started during President George W. Bush’s tenure. “This has been a long and careful process,” Robert Tuttle, former U.S. ambassador to Britain, said in October 2008. “In the end, we realized that the goal of a modern, secure and environmentally sustainable embassy could best be met by constructing a new facility.” Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO! Trump’s comments come amid reports in British media that the White House was worried about mass protests during the president’s visit. Multiple outlets say Secretary of State Rex Tillerson may travel to the U.K. instead. British Prime Minister Theresa May invited Trump to visit the country last year during her sojourn to the White House after the U.S. election. But the specter of such a invitation has been increasingly contentious. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, an outspoken Trump critic, welcomed the trip’s cancellation. “Many Londoners have made it clear that Donald Trump is not welcome here while he is pursuing such a divisive agenda,” Khan said in a tweet. “It seems he’s finally got that message. Many Londoners have made it clear that Donald Trump is not welcome here while he is pursuing such a divisive agenda. It seems he’s finally got that message. This reinforces what a mistake it was for Theresa May to rush and extend an invitation of a state visit in the first place. pic.twitter.com/lNaQGx9iBw Khan had previously called on May to cancel the invitation after Trump retweeted anti-Muslim videos from a far-right Twitter account in November, accusing the U.S. president of promoting a “vile, extremist group,” The Associated Press reported at the time. “Many Brits who love America and Americans will see this as a betrayal of the special relationship between our two countries,” Khan, who is London’s first Muslim mayor, said in a statement. “It beggars belief that the President of our closest ally doesn’t see that his support of this extremist group actively undermines the values of tolerance and diversity that makes Britain so great.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "Scholars and political pundits have long bemoaned the partisanship that pervades our politics, and the use of the Constitution to seek policy changes. Now, acrimony seems to have seeped into every part of the political process. Some observers blame the corrupting influence of campaign cash, others point to the rise of the \"tea party\" movement, still others say it is just the nature of political parties. Whatever the cause, it doesn't have to be this way. For nearly two decades, The Constitution Project, a bipartisan legal watchdog group that I head, has brought together policymakers and legal practitioners from across the ideological spectrum to develop consensus solutions to some of the toughest constitutional challenges of our time. To recognize others who share our vision, each year we present our Constitutional Champion Award to individuals and organizations who have dedicated themselves to defending our Constitution and the principles it embodies. This year, I am pleased to say that two of our honorees are Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Both have worked doggedly to build bipartisan consensus on a number of critical constitutional issues. For example, both Sen. Leahy and Sen. Paul are sponsors of the Justice Safety Valve Act, which would give federal judges the ability to impose sentences below mandatory minimums in appropriate cases and based upon mitigating factors. Mandatory minimums dictate the least amount of time a federal judge may sentence a convicted criminal for a specific crime regardless of the defendant's involvement, criminal history, mental health, addiction, and other mitigating factors. The proposed legislation would allow federal judges to tailor sentences on a case-by-case basis, returning them to the constitutional duties we expect of them. Such judicial discretion would help reduce the bloated federal prison population, while also ensuring that sentences fairly fit the circumstances of the crime and the offender. They co-sponsored similar legislation in the last Congress. \"Over the last several decades, politicians have added more and more mandatory minimum sentences to our criminal laws because they make for a good 'tough on crime' message. But the truth is they do not make our communities safer and they are breaking the bank,\" Sen. Leahy said upon introducing the most recent version of the bill in February. Sen. Paul urged Congress to quit tying the hands of federal judges, noting that mandatory minimum sentences disproportionally affect minorities and low-income communities. Sen. Leahy has long been an advocate for reaching across the aisle to safeguard fairness in the criminal justice system. More than a decade ago, for instance, he worked with then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) to include provisions in the federal law to ensure the fairer administration of the death penalty by allowing greater access to post-conviction DNA testing, thereby reducing the risk of executing innocent people. Sen. Leahy and Sen. Paul have also been leaders in protecting against the erosion of constitutional rights and principles in the name of national security. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Congress passed several laws, including the Patriot Act, that vastly expanded the search and surveillance powers of domestic law enforcement and foreign intelligence agencies like the National Security Agency and limited the ability of courts to ensure that those powers were not abused. However, most Americans were unaware of the extent of the NSA's massive surveillance apparatus until two years ago, when a series of stories based on classified documents that Edward Snowden leaked to the media spelled it out. Sen. Leahy teamed up with Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.), one of the original authors of the Patriot Act, to introduce the USA Freedom Act. The legislation was aimed at curbing dragnet collection of millions telephone records by the NSA, provide greater transparency of policies underlying government surveillance programs, and increasing due process and our Fourth Amendment rights by allowing the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to appoint a special advocate to represent privacy concerns in certain cases and requiring it to disclose significant decisions relating to Americans' privacy rights. Although a version of the bill passed the House and enjoyed the support of a majority of the Senate, a procedural hurdle kept it from coming up for a vote, and the legislation died in the waning days of the last Congress. Sen. Paul has also been a vocal critic of NSA spying. He introduced legislation declaring that \"the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution shall not be construed to allow any U.S. government agency to search the phone records of Americans without a warrant based on probable cause,\" and has made it clear that he will vote against any extension of the Patriot Act provisions expiring in June. On the issue of making certain the constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches extends into the digital age, Sen. Leahy joined forces with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) on legislation requiring law enforcement agencies to obtain a search warrant based on probable cause before accessing emails or documents stored in the cloud. Their warrant-for-content proposal - which is supported by a broad coalition of more than 70 technology companies, trade associations and privacy groups including TCP - would update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, a 1986 law that currently allows law enforcement agencies to access , without a warrant, emails that have been stored for more than 180 days and information stored in the cloud. Once the legislation is signed, law enforcement agents would still be able to seek electronic communications as evidence in criminal investigations and prosecutions, but only if they can convince a judge to provide a warrant. Sen. Paul is an ardent defender of the constitutional principle of separation of powers. Along with Sen Tim Kaine (D-Va.), he has been outspoken in his insistence that the Obama administration seek authorization from Congress in order to carry out military actions against Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq, disputing the assertion that the president as commander-in-chief could act alone. Finally, six months after the airstrikes began, President Obama submitted a request for war authority to Congress, and the Senate is expected to take up the issue in the coming weeks. Of course, these are but a few of the issues on which these two statesmen have been standing for fairness, liberty and constitutional principles. TCP is proud to recognize them with our 2015 Constitutional Champion Award. In addition, for reasons I have outlined in another column, we will also honor Twitter for their strong defense of the First Amendment and of the public's right-to-know. Sen. Leahy and Sen. Paul, along with Twitter, will accept the award at TCP's annual gala on April 22 at the offices of Jones Day in Washington, D.C.

        "articles": "Hillary Clinton's 6-point lead over Donald Trump in last month's CBS News poll has now evaporated. As of mid-July (even before Trump enjoys a predictable post-convention bump in the polls) she is tied with him. Each garners the support of 40 percent of voters. This is astounding, given that Trump's campaign is in shambles while hers is a well-oiled machine; that he's done almost no advertising while she began the month spending $500,000 a day on ads; and that Republican leaders are deserting him while Democrats are lining up behind her. The near tie is particularly astonishing given that Trump has no experience and offers no coherent set of policies or practical ideas but only venomous bigotry and mindless xenophobia, while Hillary Clinton has a boatload of experience, a storehouse of carefully-crafted policies, and a deep understanding of what the nation must do in order to come together and lead the world. What happened? Apparently the FBI's recent report on Clinton's email heightened what already were public concerns about her honesty and trustworthiness. Last month, on that same CBS poll, 62 percent of voters said she's not honest and trustworthy; now 67 percent of voters have that view. So as the Republican convention prepares to nominate the least qualified and most divisive candidate in American history, the Democrats are about to nominate among the most qualified and yet also most distrusted. What explains this underlying distrust? I've known Hillary Clinton since she was 19 years old. For twenty-five years I've watched as she and her husband became quarries of the media - especially, but not solely, the rightwing media. I was there in 1992 when she defended her husband against Jennifer Flower's charges of infidelity. I was in the cabinet when she was accused of fraudulent dealings in Whitewater, and then accused of wrongdoing in the serial rumor mills of \"Travelgate\" and \"Troopergate,\" followed by withering criticism of her role as chair of Bill Clinton's healthcare task force. I saw her be accused of conspiracy in the tragic suicide of Vince Foster, her friend and former colleague, who, not incidentally,wrote shortly before his death that \"here [in Washington] ruining people is considered sport.\" Rush Limbaugh claimed that \"Vince Foster was murdered in an apartment owned by Hillary Clinton,\" and the New York Postreported that administration officials \"frantically scrambled\" to remove from Foster's office safe a previously unreported set of files, some of them related to Whitewater. I saw Kennth Starr's Whitewater investigation metastasize into the soap opera of Bill Clinton's second term, featuring Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, and Juanita Broaddrick, among others - culminating in Bill Clinton's impeachment and Hillary's very public (and, presumably, intensely private) humiliation. Then, more recently, came the storm over Benghazi, which led to inquiries about her email server, followed by the questions about whether or how the Clinton Foundation charitable work and the Clintons' own for-profit speeches might have intersected with her work at the State Department. It is worth noting that despite all the stories, allegations, accusations, insinuations, and investigations spread over a quarter century - there has never been any finding that Hillary Clinton engaged in illegal behavior. But it's understandable why someone who has been under such relentless attack for a large portion of her adult life might be reluctant to expose every minor error or misstep that could be blown up into another \"scandal,\" another media circus, another interminable set of investigations generating half-baked conspiracy theories and seemingly endless implications of wrongdoing. Given this history, any sane person might reflexively seek to minimize small oversights, play down innocent acts of carelessness, or not fully disclose mistakes of no apparent consequence, for fear of cutting loose the next attack dogs. Such a person might even be reluctant to let their guard down and engage in impromptu news conferences or veer too far off script. Yet that reflexive impulse can itself generate distrust when such responses eventually come to light, as they often do - as when, for example, Hillary was shown to be less than forthright over her emails. The cumulative effect can create the impression of someone who, at worst, is guilty of serial cover-ups, or, at best, shades the truth. So while Hillary Clinton's impulse is understandable, it is also self-defeating, as now evidenced by the growing portion of the public that doesn't trust her. It is critically important that she recognizes this, that she fight her understandable impulse to keep potential attackers at bay, and that from here on she makes herself far more open and accessible - and clearly and fearlessly tells all.

        "articles": "New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the chamber's third-ranking Democrat, plans to announce his opposition to the nuclear deal negotiated by the U.S., Iran, and five world powers tomorrow, three people familiar with his thinking tell The Huffington Post. Schumer's move will come a day after New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Schumer's fellow New York senator, Kirstin Gillibrand, announced their support for the deal. That momentum is blunted by Schumer's pending announcement. Backers of the deal had hoped that if Schumer decided to oppose the deal, he would hold off until the last minute. Schumer's support of a war footing over diplomacy puts him at odds with the Democratic caucus he intends to lead next term, though it is consistent with the position he has long taken. As the soon-to-be leader of his party in the Senate, Schumer’s decision to directly fight President Barack Obama on the biggest foreign policy achievement of his presidency is a bold, but not surprising, move. Schumer has long been more hawkish on foreign policy than some of his fellow Democrats. In 2002, he voted for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force in Iraq. In 2006 he backed John Bolton's nomination to serve as George W. Bush's ambassador to the United Nations, reportedly telling a Senate Democratic caucus meeting that \"a vote against Bolton was a vote against Israel.\" Bolton is an ardent foe of negotiation with Iran. In response to Schumer's announcment, MoveOn, an anti-war advocacy group and political action committee vowed to launch a donor strike against the Democratic Party, with the stated goal of withholding $10 million in contributions over the next three days. \"No real Democratic leader does this,\" MoveOn wrote of the incoming party leader in a statement. \"If this is what counts as 'leadership' among Democrats in the Senate, Senate Democrats should be prepared to find a new leader or few followers,\" the statement continued, noting that Schumer should have learned from supporting the \"misguided war of choice in Iraq.\" Despite the backlash from supporters of the nuclear deal, Schumer was under mounting pressure to oppose the accord. The New York Senator has a sizable Jewish constituency and has developed close ties to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the influential pro-Israel lobbying group that has pledged over $20 million to kill the nuclear accord. During his 34 years in Congress, Schumer has become fond of telling his voters that his surname is derived from “shomer,” the Hebrew word for “guardian.” “I am a shomer for Israel and I will continue to be that with every bone in my body,” he said in 2010. But to his more hawkish pro-Israel constituents, Schumer’s hesitation to announce his position and his failure to whip fellow Democrats against the deal demonstrate a betrayal of this promise. “Schumer, you are no shomer,” yelled a crowd of 10,000 protesters rallying against the Iran deal in New York City's Times Square last month. “Where is Chuck? Kill this deal!” they chanted. Schumer’s announcement comes one month before lawmakers hold a critical vote on a resolution of disapproval of the nuclear accord, which would revoke the president’s ability to waive some sanctions against Iran and likely kill the deal. Even if all Republican senators vote down the deal (and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake is a big if), 13 Democrats will need to join them in order to override Obama’s inevitable veto of the resolution. In the past several days, a handful of fence-sitting Democrats have come out in support of the nuclear agreement -- including Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), and Gillibrand -- making it increasingly unlikely that Schumer and other opponents of the diplomatic accord will succeed in driving it down. Schumer did not immediately respond to a request for comment but later gave the New York Times a lengthy statement on his position. “Advocates on both sides have strong cases for their point of view that cannot simply be dismissed,\" Schumer wrote. \"This has made evaluating the agreement a difficult and deliberate endeavor, and after deep study, careful thought and considerable soul-searching, I have decided I must oppose the agreement and will vote yes on a motion of disapproval.” ﻿This post has been updated to include Schumer's and MoveOn's statements Enter your email address: Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is a talented woman with tremendous leadership skills and keen sense of purpose. She's survived decades of criticism from Republicans, in addition to the political baggage associated with her husband, and helped create a powerhouse within the Democratic Party. Although I'm the biggest Bernie Sanders booster on the internet, I appreciate the fact Hillary Clinton endured the sexism of the 1990's and once courageously battled Gingrich and other Republicans. She's earned a great deal of what she's built, and alongside Bill Clinton, helped redefine American politics in many respects. However, what drives me to advocate a Bernie Sanders presidency in such a passionate manner can be summarized by the astute political evaluation of both Clintons from Joy-Ann Reid. In an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now, Ms. Reid explains a central theme of her book titled Fracture: Barack Obama, the Clintons, and the Racial Divide: JOY-ANN REID: Yeah, it's interesting, because Hillary Clinton has had this remarkable arc over the course of her life, from being a sort of conservative, \"Goldwater Girl\"... And so she sort of occupied this strange space that has mirrored the Democratic Party, that's gone left, she's gone right, she's been hawkish, she's been sort of the neocon in the party. In my writing and in my advocacy of Bernie Sanders, I've tried to highlight this critical aspect of the 2016 Election, albeit in a more forceful manner. Hillary Clinton has gone right, and like Ms. Reid states, \"she's been hawkish, she's been sort of the neocon in the party.\" In addition to Joy-Ann Reid, leading historians in The New York Times have discussed Hillary Clinton's neoconservative advisers, in addition to a future \"neocon\" foreign policy. Vox states Hillary Clinton will pull the Democrats -- and the country -- in a hawkish direction, yet the same people who believe Dick Cheney is Satan's spawn could care less. The billions spent on perpetual wars could fund universal healthcare, but again, liberals have evolved on the definition of \"pragmatism.\" This privilege is the embodiment of the Clinton name, but also the embodiment of the fact both Clintons are white. Hillary Clinton once called Barack Obama \"elitist\" for stating Americans cling to their guns, and ran a racist 3 a. m. ad questioning his ability to make the right foreign policy decisions, yet few liberal pundits remember ancient history. In response, Obama labeled Clinton \"Annie Oakley,\" but the politics showed a white Democrat painting her black rival as weak; both in domestic and foreign policy. Militarism, and it's affects within American society, removes the emphasis away from those in poverty or struggling economically and towards threats like ISIS. More time is spent on nightly news programs addressing terrorism than the 27% of African Americans living in poverty or the 1 million African Americans in prison. While a Bernie Sanders presidency would limit overarching foreign policy objectives and focus upon universal healthcare and free college tuition, his rival is never questioned about the price tag associated with destroying ISIS. Rather, the pragmatism of free college tuition is now an issue, even on the left, while Clinton's foreign policy is hailed as smart power, not dangerous and costly. Since the Democratic Party should stand for the antithesis of Dick Cheney and Rumsfeld, it's bizarre that progressive pundits would ignore a glaring philosophical weakness in Hillary Clinton's record on war and foreign policy. Not many people can vote for Iraq, advocate a disastrous Libyan intervention, and write a glowing book review on Henry Kissinger's memoirs, yet still be called a liberal icon. This is the epitome of white privilege. Hillary's privilege allows this bizarre state of affairs to exist. To Hillary supporters, experience is measured in years, certainly not a stellar track record on the primary powers of a president: war and foreign policy. In terms of unilateral powers (the Authorization for Use of Military Force), the ability to wage war makes America's president the most powerful person in the world. Of course, the Bush Administration started the ball rolling on perpetual wars, but Democrats like Hillary Clinton helped them in this regard. Ultimately, this dynamic hurts poor people. Martin Luther King's Beyond Vietnam speech in 1967 highlights the relationship between war and poverty: A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor, both black and white, through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam, and I watched this program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything on a society gone mad on war. The most striking example of white privilege in America, and something that most progressive pundits ignore, is placing greater emphasis on war than the plight of struggling Americans. Only a white politician in America can overtly challenge the core principles of liberal politics, and get away with it, while simultaneously expecting the support of minority voters. In a sense, Hillary Clinton is the progressive whisperer, capable of a Jedi mind trick of epic proportions, while The Daily Beast and Banters of the world rush eagerly towards a right-wing cliff of Henry Kissinger's politics and an Iraq vote \"mistake.\" Remember the militarized police in Ferguson? The Washington Post writes The Pentagon gave nearly half a billion dollars of military gear to local law enforcement last year. Think foreign policy doesn't affect the black and Latino communities? Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said \"Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of war.\" Dr. King's words are just as relevant today as they were in 1967. After two major wars and failed policies that devastated the Middle East, do you think a black or Latina woman could run for president on a record of voting for Iraq, while simultaneously defending against an email scandal? If white privilege has any definition, it's the ability to be linked to an FBI investigation, while simultaneously touting one's experience. If Michelle Obama had been involved in endless scandals, one can only imagine the effects on her political future, especially if she were to run for public office. Being a Clinton, and being a white woman, has benefited Hillary tremendously. Even with the FBI investigating a private server, and with 67% of Americans distrusting her, Clinton is still running for president. You simply can't earn that kind of overt privilege; it's given to you by the same people who complain about it in progressive publications. In contrast, Bernie Sanders has indeed earned everything he's ever accomplished in politics, and was never given a free pass on scandal or controversy. He's certainly benefited from being white, but this benefit doesn't allow him to circumvent an FBI investigation or flawed Congressional votes on war. In terms of fundraising, he's never spoken to Wall Street for millions of dollars, and relies upon the American people to finance his campaign. He's honest, and his honesty is at times a political liability, but he remains true to himself, regardless of the consequences. He's not a casino capitalist, he's a Democratic-Socialist like FDR and Teddy Roosevelt. If you don't like it, too bad, because he's going to fight for working people and especially poor people, and even the paranoid rantings of Claire McCaskill regarding Sanders being \"too liberal\" won't influence his value system. He actually has a value system, unlike his rival. Sanders was arrested in 1963 as a Civil Rights advocate. He endorsed Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988, and the great Harry Belafonte has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. Vermont's Senator isn't part of a political machine, wasn't married to a president, and wasn't appointed Secretary of State because of a political utility. It's a long presidential race and Bernie Sanders has the money to fight until the end. He'll win the presidency, either because the FBI descended upon the Clinton campaign, or because he's less than 6 points behind Clinton nationally. The gleeful naysayers are already predicting a Sanders defeat, just like they failed to predict his ability to battle the Clinton machine. Rest assured, Bernie Sanders has just begun to fight. As for Clinton's prison lobbyist donations, I discuss this overt example of white privilege in the following YouTube segment. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.",

        "articles": "Maine Gov. Paul LePage made a racist claim about his state's heroin epidemic on Wednesday, alleging men with nicknames like \"D-Money\" are coming from cities to sell heroin and \"impregnate\" Maine's white women. During a town hall meeting in Bridgton, Maine, LePage was asked how he plans to address the state's heroin epidemic. The first step, LePage said, is beefing up enforcement. \"Now the traffickers ... These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty, these types of guys. They come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, and they go back home,\" LePage said. \"Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue that we've got to deal with down the road. We're going to make them very severe penalties.\" LePage's office didn't immediately return a request for comment. The governor's office did provide comment to the Portland Press-Herald, which first reported the remarks. \"The governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant,” LePage communications director Peter Steele said. “What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood, too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state.\" Click here to watch video of LePage's remarks, starting around 1:55. LePage's remarks drew a strong response from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. \"Governor LePage’s comments tonight are not only offensive and hurtful but they try to cover up the very real epidemic of drug abuse facing people in his state and across the country,\" Hillary for America's Marlon Marshall said in a statement. \"LePage’s racist rants sadly distract from efforts to address one of our nation’s most pressing problems.\" Maine, like many other states, has seen a major spike in heroin treatment and overdoses in recent years. LePage has previously called for greater enforcement against out-of-state dealers, and said last year he would consider using the state's National Guard. Maine lawmakers are considering a bill to help ease the crisis that would include money for Drug Enforcement Administration agents and other law enforcement, in addition to funding for treatment programs and facilities. LePage, however, has threatened to veto the bill for what he said was favoritism toward treatment facilities receiving funding. In August, a drug addiction clinic in Sanford, Maine, closed its doors, blaming LePage's policies. \"In Maine, Governor LePage is discussing calling in the National Guard to combat the state's drug epidemic while leaving multi-million dollar grant opportunities for funding treatment on the table,\" Charles Faris, the president of Spectrum Health Systems, said. LePage has made many offensive remarks during his time in office, and in 2013 was accused of saying President Barack Obama hates white people. LePage denied the reports. The governor also made headlines in 2011 after the NAACP criticized him for turning down invitations to several of the group's events. LePage put the civil rights group on blast, pointing to a Jamaican teenager who moved in with his family in 2002 (whom LePage refers to as his adopted son) as evidence he is not racist. \"Tell ‘em to kiss my butt,” LePage said. \"If they want to play the race card, come to dinner and my son will talk to them.\" Recently, LePage has joined New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on the Republican presidential campaign trail. LePage was Christie's first major endorser, and has made several campaign appearances with him. (Christie stumped for LePage in 2014.) Meanwhile, LePage may soon face impeachment. Democrats in the state legislature plan to move forward with an impeachment motion next week.

        "articles": "Hillary Clinton's campaign announcement is an insult to the presidency. It represents a total capitulation to the political consulting business -- two-and-a-half minutes of marketing images, without anything resembling serious argument. Madison Avenue has replaced Madison at the center of the Republic. Clinton's 30 second appearance in her grade-B advertisement is a tribute to sound-bite democracy. The triviality of her performance is heightened by apologists who are already reading deep meanings into her two-liner: \"The deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion.\" (See here and here.) Nothing compelled Clinton to choose this path to emptiness. To the contrary, she has the nomination locked up, giving her the freedom to define her campaign on her own terms. If she found a face-to-face format most congenial, a fifteen minute video would have sufficed to set out her core political commitments. She has chosen instead to leave all of us in the dark. This will make it easier for her to fine-tune her message to exploit the particular weaknesses of the Republican who wins the primaries. But it is all too likely that she will leave her supporters guessing about the seriousness of her progressive commitments, whatever they may turn out to be. At the end of the day, this evasive strategy won't prevent me from casting my ballot for Hillary on Election Day -- since a third Clinton term will save us from a fourth Bush term, or something even worse. Nevertheless, even if she makes it to the White House, her Madison Avenue campaign is a grim augury for the future. If Clinton has so utterly failed to stand up for anything at a moment of such great political strength, is there any reason to expect her presidency to serve as a platform for an ambitious campaign for progressive values? Or will 2020 be a year of deepening liberal alienation -- in which Hillary Clinton's performance as America's first woman president serves to emphasize the shattered hopes inspired by Barack Obama's \"Yes We Can?\" Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale, is currently the Daimler Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin.

        "articles": "As a Jew, I don't like people making Hitler comparisons. I don't like when they do it to President Obama. I didn't like when people did it to President Bush. There was only one Hitler, and we have not had a politician who rose to that level -- yet. That said, a chill went down my spine when I saw private remarks from Chris Christie, regarding one of Donald Trump's first moves, if he is elected. Reuters reports: If he wins the presidency, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would seek to purge the federal government of officials appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and could ask Congress to pass legislation making it easier to fire public workers, Trump ally, Chris Christie, said on Tuesday. Why is this scary? It is literally one of the first moves made by Adolf Hitler, upon democratically attaining power. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed just two months after Hitler became Chancellor of Germany. It was such a major piece of his plan to ultimately become dictator, that the Holocaust Museum notes it on their timeline of events: The German government issues the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums), which excludes Jews and other political opponents of the Nazis from all civil service positions. Gutting government of any civil service officers who are not completely and blindly loyal to the new leader usually is one of the first moves of someone looking to become a dictator. Another act is one Trump previously voiced support for - tighter control over a free press. Whether dictatorship is the overt intent of Donald Trump or not, what cannot be denied is that a move like this runs completely counter to the very idea of our Republic, whose very Constitution goes to very, very great lengths to prevent usurping of that kind of power. Whether it is Saddam, or Stalin, going after the bureaucracy, purging it, and installing loyalists is almost always a first step for a rising dictator. Apparently, that has not gone unnoticed by Trump, who openly admires Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and Saddam Hussein. This is not hyperbole. This is not a joke. This is real. Donald Trump's man in charge of putting together a government seriously just said that one of Donald Trump's first moves will be the same as one of Hitler's. Conservatives often talk a big game about the Constitution, about fighting tyranny. Now that Donald Trump's plans are transparent, we'll see just how serious they are about that.

        "articles": "President Barack Obama on Monday will throw his support behind a new proposal to dramatically revamp the federal student loan program, according to the White House. A bill proposed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would allow borrowers to potentially save thousands of dollars by giving them a chance to effectively pay off their high-rate existing loans in exchange for new loans that carry substantially lower interest rates. The Obama administration initially was hesitant to fully embrace the bill because of disagreements over how to pay for it. But with mounting pressure from advocacy groups, and with a renewed political focus on issues confronting working families, the president has softened his opposition. Obama’s endorsement would be the latest recognition to date of the ascendance of Warren-style populism within the Democratic Party. An administration official told The Huffington Post that Obama is expected to \"call for passage of the refinancing bill\" when it comes up for a vote, as it is scheduled to do next week. Student groups and other organizations focusing on younger Americans enthusiastically support Warren’s bill, under which new interest rates would range from 3.86 percent for loans taken out by borrowers when they were undergraduates to 6.41 percent for parents who took out loans for their children's college tuition, as well as for borrowers who took out loans to pay for graduate school. The financial industry, perhaps not surprisingly, is less enamored with the proposal. The bill would allow borrowers to refinance loans owned by the private sector into new loans made by the Education Department. Paying off loans early deprives lenders of future interest income, causing paper losses. Republicans appear to be dead set against enacting the proposal into law, but for different reasons. The Democrats proposed to offset the loss of future federal revenue by increasing taxes on the wealthy -- a pay-for idea that is anathema in conservative circles. “This bill doesn’t make college more affordable, reduce the amount of money students will have to borrow, or do anything about the lack of jobs grads face in the Obama economy,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement. The lack of Republican support means the proposal would be unlikely to garner the 60 votes needed to prevent a filibuster in the Senate or pass the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. Analysts at Compass Point Research & Trading, a financial firm, put the odds of it becoming law at less than 10 percent. But Democrats, including the White House, still are likely to hold a vote in hopes of placing Republicans on the wrong side of an issue that is becoming increasingly important to American households. Some 40 million Americans have student loans. They collectively owe $1.3 trillion, making student debt the second-biggest form of consumer debt after home mortgages. Unpaid student debt has doubled since 2007, according to the Federal Reserve. \"College has never been more important, but it’s also never been more expensive,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said this week. \"So we commend the efforts in the Senate and look forward to working with them to pass this bill.\" Warren's bill is a central part of Senate Democrats’ so-called “Fair Shot” agenda in advance of November’s elections. Thirty-five other senators are co-sponsoring the measure. “The bill is part of Democrats' strategy to highlight a number of issues they believe will energize their voting base ahead of the midterm elections,” analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote in a note to clients last month. But the cost to enact the proposal combined with new taxes, they added, “suggests to us that the Warren bill is more about the politics of the issue and not about passing the bill.\" Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "WASHINGTON ― The Republican Party of Virginia is attacking the state’s Democratic attorney general, Mark Herring, for visiting one of the U.S.’s largest mosques to talk about President Donald Trump’s Muslim ban. “On March 17, Mark Herring joined with a Hamas-linked group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, to host a town hall to oppose the Trump Administration’s efforts to keep Americans safe from terrorism,” reads a petition on the state Republican Party’s website that appears designed to collect emails. “Sign our petition to demand that Mark Herring apologize to the victims of Islamic terrorism.” The message’s characterization of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a major Muslim civil society organization, as an affiliate of the Palestinian terror group Hamas echoes a theory that is popular in the right-wing media and Islamophobic circles but has never been proven. And the party’s description of the mosque where the event was held ― the Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia ― mentions former attendees who have been linked to terror, but makes no reference to the center’s outreach to the FBI, including hosting a top FBI official at the mosque in January. It also doesn’t mention the harassment, including a fake bomb threat and offensive messages, the community there has experienced in recent months. From the White House on down, Islamophobic rhetoric and actions are on the rise nationally. An FBI report released in November 2016 noted a 67 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes between 2014 and 2015. In Virginia, an increasingly purple state that twice voted for President Barack Obama and chose Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump, Republicans have tried to differentiate themselves from an increasingly anti-Muslim national GOP. Former Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.) has visited the mosque at the center of the controversy, and in December, the current chair of the state GOP, John Whitbeck, visited a different mosque in Sterling, Virginia. “The Virginia Republican Party is the party of religious liberty. We don’t support banning Muslims in the United States of America,” Whitbeck said at the time. Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), a lawmaker from a swing district Democrats are hoping to pick up in 2018, also attended the Sterling mosque event. She called Trump’s 2015 proposal to ban Muslim entry to the U.S. “not constitutional” and said she believed the president had changed his mind. Yet the party’s message about Herring suggests that it sees any engagement with Muslims as unacceptable and insulting to those who have experienced Islam-linked terror. “Stop pandering to terrorist sympathizers,” the appeal reads, conveniently ignoring the fact that Muslims in the U.S. and abroad are frequently victims of terror themselves. The GOP message reflects the increasingly extreme discourse and political polarization of the Trump era. Muslims’ place in American society is now a major issue of national debate, rather than something that’s largely accepted. A similar trend has emerged in Europe, with the rise of hyper-nationalist and often anti-Muslim parties. Once-extreme ideas like a Muslim ban or closing all mosques are now part of the political conversation, and politicians trying not to look weak are beginning to adopt more nativist and authoritarian talking points. “Under the cover of fighting off the ‘populists,’ the political establishment is slowly but steadily hollowing out the liberal democratic system,” Cas Mudde, a University of Georgia professor who studies European politics, argued in a March 20 op-ed. Robert McCaw, the government affairs director for CAIR and a speaker at the March 17 event, slammed the Virginia GOP’s petition. He said the mosque event offered more than 200 attendees a message of reassurance about their place in the U.S. “It’s not Herring [who] needs to apologize. It’s the state Republican party for engaging in this smear,” McCaw said. “It endangers Muslims when you have a state party smear an entire faith community in their house of worship. What type of signal is this sending, and on whose ears will it fall?” Colin Christopher, the deputy director of government affairs for Dar al-Hijrah, contacted HuffPost Tuesday night to say the congregation saw the GOP message as a sign of the party’s shift toward what he called “extremism.” “Instead of talking about the economic challenges our country faces, the party instead chose to try and criminalize an entire community that was hosting a citizenship application clinic and know-your-rights event with the highest law enforcement official in the State of Virginia,” Christopher said. The center is used to fear-mongering, he added. “If anyone wants to understand who Dar al-Hijrah is, what we do, they have to go no further than to talk to members of Congress, to local elected officials, to every single rabbi, priest and other religious leader in Fairfax County and Arlington County and they’ll get the story,” Christopher said. “We’re not threatened by this kind of language. It just shows the character of the Republican Party.” Herring’s team responded Tuesday night as well. “While Attorney General Herring is actively working to reassure Virginia Muslims and other minority communities that they are safe and welcome, the [Republican Party of Virginia] is sending dangerous messages that only embolden those who want to harm or harass Muslims here in our communities,” communications director Michael Kelly said in an email. “I’ll go ahead and extend an open, standing invitation to anyone from the RPV or any Republican elected official or candidate to join us the next time Attorney General Herring visits a Virginia mosque and they can tell their fellow Virginians to their face how they’re ‘terrorist sympathizers.’” Herring is one of several state attorneys general challenging Trump’s ban. “I’m here to defend and protect the rights and civil liberties of all Virginians, including minority communities, no matter what you look like, what your background is,” Herring told attendees at the March 17 event. John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia GOP, told HuffPost his party was troubled by the specific mosque Herring spoke at, not by the general idea of political appearances at mosques. He also condemned CAIR, saying he was certain the civil society organization had links to Hamas. As proof, he emailed a link to a National Review story that cited a decision by the United Arab Emirates to designate CAIR a terror group. (Experts say the UAE action had more to do with suppressing civil society than a true terror threat, but anti-Muslim figures in the U.S. have cheered that government’s repression.) Findlay said he could not imagine the GOP engaging with CAIR. “We didn’t smear an entire faith community in any way, shape or form,” Findlay said. “We were commenting on Mark Herring’s appearance at this mosque that has been linked to multiple terrorists.” The visit by Davis, the former Republican lawmaker, was different because he had already left office, Findlay said. Asked whether he thought it was appropriate for the FBI to attend an event there this past January, he replied, “Oh, man ... when did they?” Findlay then said the bureau’s decision was different because FBI employees were not politicians. Asked again, he said he did not want to comment on the matter. This story has been updated to include comment from John Findlay, Herring’s office and Dar al-Hijrah.

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- A group of 28 House Republican lawmakers, all men, are pledging to do everything in their power to defund Planned Parenthood this fall, even it means shutting down the federal government in protest. In a letter circulated this summer by Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), the congressmen pledged to vote against any bill that funds the federal government if it includes money for Planned Parenthood. Congress must fund the government by Sept. 30 to avoid a shutdown. \"We must act to fully defund Planned Parenthood,\" the letter says. \"Please know that we cannot and will not support any funding resolution – an appropriations bill, an omnibus package, a continuing resolution, or otherwise – that contains any funding for Planned Parenthood, including mandatory funding streams.\" The lawmakers cited a series of heavily edited undercover videos that show Planned Parenthood doctors discussing the donation of fetal tissue for medical research after abortions. The anti-abortion group that circulated the videos claims that the family planning provider is selling fetal parts for profit, although multiple state investigations into that claim have come up with nothing. Planned Parenthood receives about $500 million in government funding, mostly through Medicaid and a federal family planning program. The money is used to subsidize birth control, cancer screenings and other women's health services. The longstanding Hyde Amendment prevents any federal funds from being used to pay for abortions, but Republicans have been trying to defund Planned Parenthood over its abortion services since 2011. The current fight over Planned Parenthood funding has divided the GOP. While Republican leaders in the House and Senate are hoping to avoid a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding -- because the GOP would likely absorb most of the blame for it -- the conservative voices in both chambers are growing louder. As Mulvaney's letter continues to gain signatures, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is leading the effort on the Senate side to hold up the must-pass federal budget bill in a bid to defund the family planning provider. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) waved the white flag on the Planned Parenthood fight last week, conceding that Republicans don't have the votes to defund the organization this year. But if enough Republicans sign on to Mulvaney's pledge and stand their ground in the fall, the House could potentially stall the government funding bill on its own. \"If we shut down government, it will be because you have willful Republicans who are prepared to take the government hostage to attain their ends,\" House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters on Tuesday. \"It will not be a stumble; it will be a considered objective, and a number of them have said so publicly.\" The 28 Republicans threatening a shutdown are Reps. Mulvaney, Jim Jordan (Ohio), John Fleming (La.), Raúl Labrador (Idaho), Matt Salmon (Ariz.), Tim Huelskamp (Kan.), Jeff Duncan (S.C.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Trey Gowdy (S.C.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Curt Clawson (Fla.), Jim Bridenstine (Okla.), Keith Rothfus (Pa.), Randy Weber (Texas), Scott Perry (Pa.), Steven Pearce (N.M.), Trent Franks (Ariz.), Louie Gohmert (Texas), Ted Yoho (Fla.), Jody Hice (Ga.), David Rouzer (N.C.), Dave Brat (Va.), Mark Meadows (N.C.), Scott DesJarlais (Tenn.), Mark Walker (N.C.), Brian Babin (Texas), David Schweikert (Ariz.), and Trent Kelly (Miss.).

        "articles": "An Ohio county chairman for the Republican Party provoked outrage after posting a Facebook message declaring that the fires devastating parts of California are “God’s punishment” for the “liberal” state. David Johnson, chairman of the Columbiana County GOP, posted images of the inferno Sunday with the message: “God’s Punishment to Liberal California.” Another message superimposed over a photo read: “Hell on Earth, brought to you by the liberals in California.” David Betras, the Democratic Party chairman in Mahoning County, Ohio, called the comments “disturbing” and Johnson a “coward,” demanding his resignation. “I would say that Johnson should be ashamed of himself, but as he and the president he worships have proved time and again, they have no shame,” Betras said in a statement. “Johnson owes the victims, their families, and the heroes who fought the fires and participated in rescue efforts an apology.” After some Facebook comments urged boycotting Johnson’s businesses, he took down his post, but doubled down on the message in a statement to WFMJ-TV. “California has been overtaken by liberals who have taxed and over-regulated the state,” he said. “There are changes that could have been made which would have helped prevent the deadly fires had there been proper management of forests, but the timber industry is not allowed.” The comment echoed a tweet from President Donald Trump that the fires were caused by forest “mismanagement” by the state. But fire officials denied that, pointing out that the fires were in a town in northern California (surrounded by a federal forest) and in urban and suburban communities in Los Angeles County. Johnson meanwhile insisted that his “heart goes out” to people who died in the fires and those who lost homes. He was a bit more contrite in a statement about his “inartful” message to Cleveland.com: “It’s how I feel about liberals, but did I mean that God is going to punish everyone who lives in California? No. It’s a figure of speech, and I probably shouldn’t have done it. But I did, and it doesn’t change how I feel about what’s happened in California.” He accused Betras of “exploiting” his Facebook post. At least 77 people have died and close to 1,000 people are still unaccounted for in the Camp fire in Northern California, and fires have also devastated parts of Southern California.

        "articles": "PORTLAND ― Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) is not about to let armed, pro-gun enthusiasts intimidate her when she advocates for gun control, even if they hang and burn an effigy of her on the steps of the state capitol. Which they did. Last week, dozens of people advocating open carry laws strung up and set afire a mannequin that represented Brown, which they taunted as it smoldered on the ground. The guy hanging the effigy was wearing a mask. Someone on a microphone mentioned white supremacy. Another attendee talked about all the money she had to spend to put her son in a Christian school “so his gender can be preserved.” It was all kinds of crazy. Here’s a video from the scene: .@itsmikebivins here's the video -- had to wait to get it sent to me because Facebook wouldn't let me save to the phone pic.twitter.com/HqHB75cd2V ”Oh, look at Kate burn,” one man says. “Take that, Kate Brown!” shouts another woman. “Down with Brown.” The governor wasn’t in Salem at the time. But on Friday, she had a message for those trying to scare her away from taking action on gun control. “If these extreme groups continue to burn mannequins of me, an effigy, every time I stand up for the safety of Oregonians, then they’re going to run out of mannequins,” Brown said during a gubernatorial debate in Portland. She got a round of applause. The governor has been pressing legislators to pass bills limiting gun sales when background checks take longer than expected, and banning a gun sale for 30 days if someone warns authorities that the buyer may be going through a mental health crisis. She signed an executive order earlier this year to give police more tools for tracking gun transactions, and to create a work group to review firearms-related domestic violence offenses. Brown is running against Republican gubernatorial challenger Bud Pierce in November. She’s currently leading Pierce 43 to 35 percent, according to a September poll by DHM Research, an independent survey firm in Portland. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

        "articles": "For the first time, a U.S. Supreme Court decision has denounced the infamous 1944 ruling that supported the constitutionality of Japanese-American incarceration during World War II, calling that ruling “morally repugnant” and “gravely wrong.” The court’s declaration came Tuesday in a decision upholding President Donald Trump’s travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries. The president had once likened his ban to President Franklin Roosevelt’s discriminatory policies during World War II. But Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote for the majority, brought up Korematsu v. United States to differentiate it from the ruling in favor of Trump’s travel ban. “Korematsu has nothing to do with this case,” Roberts wrote, referencing the lawsuit filed by Japanese-American Fred Korematsu, who was arrested for refusing to report to the camps in 1942. “The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority,” Roberts stated. “Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and — to be clear — ‘has no place in law under the Constitution.’” Legal experts may argue whether that constitutes an official overturning of the earlier decision, but for all practical and symbolic purposes, Roberts’ words mean the Korematsu precedent is gone. Attorney Dale Minami, who helped overturn Fred Korematsu’s conviction for violating the federal order in 1983, described the court’s declaration as long overdue, though “bittersweet.” “I think Fred would be happy and sad. He’d be happy that the Supreme Court finally did what they should have done in the first place,” Minami said. “But at the same time, I think that Fred’s vision of civil rights extended beyond his own case.” (Fred Korematsu died in 2005 at the age of 86.) Minami accused the Supreme Court of having made its decision on Trump’s travel ban without adequate evidence. The same mistake led to the court’s ruling in favor of prison camps seven decades ago, he said. In 2011, the U.S. Solicitor General’s Office admitted that at the time of the lawsuits filed by Korematsu and fellow Japanese-American Gordon Hirabayashi, it had evidence supporting the argument that the majority of Japanese-Americans did not pose a potential security threat. This evidence was deliberately not submitted to the court, the acting solicitor general said. In the case of Trump’s travel ban, information was also deliberately withheld from consideration in the lower courts because it was deemed classified. “It just feeds into this whole sense that now all three branches of government are leaning so far right,” Minami said. John Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, also expressed concern that the justices in the current case had “blindly deferred to the judgment of the executive branch.” “It’s almost ironic or a slap in the face that the Korematsu case was overturned this way,” he said. Dissenting justices in Trump v. Hawaii didn’t miss this point. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose dissent was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, expressed concern that Trump’s policy “masquerades behind a facade of national-security concerns.” “In Korematsu, the Court gave ‘a pass [to] an odious, gravely injurious racial classification’ authorized by an executive order,” Sotomayor wrote. “As here, the Government invoked an ill-defined national security threat to justify an exclusionary policy of sweep­ing proportion.” Attorney Don Tamaki ― who represents the adult children of Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and Minoru Yasui, who also filed a lawsuit against the federal government’s targeting of Japanese-Americans ― took a similar view. “[Sotomayor’s] point here is that in 1944, the court just surrendered,” Tamaki told HuffPost. “They said if the military government tells us that Japanese-American citizens are dangerous, then we believe the government. It never said, ‘Where’s the proof?’” Tamaki warned that when the Supreme Court is willing to look the other way and not demand the full facts, there’s an overwhelming temptation to manipulate the evidence. The adult children of Korematsu, Hirabayashi and Yasui all spoke out against the Supreme Court’s decision on Tuesday. “The travel ban is unjust and singles out individuals due to the religion they practice, similar to Executive Order 9066 that unconstitutionally imprisoned my father due to his Japanese ancestry,” Karen Korematsu, Fred Korematsu’s daughter, said in a statement obtained by HuffPost. Jay Hirabayashi, son of Gordon Hirabayashi, echoed that disappointment: “The Supreme Court’s decision today reaffirms that despite 75 years, xenophobia still reigns true in our country.” Holly Yasui, daughter of Minoru Yasui, called the court’s decision a repeat of history. “Again, our Court has allowed executive power to go unchecked even though the Muslim travel ban and other immigration policies have clear antecedents of religious and racial animus, as was the case in 1942,” she said. “We need to continue to fight for justice. We must never give up!”",

        "articles": "Costa Rica may have accidentally approved same-sex unions. Costa Rican lawmakers approved a bill on Monday that changed article 22 of the ‘Law of Young People’ according to local newspaper La Nación. The text previously stated that unions were only recognized if they were between a man and a woman. Now conservative lawmakers are realizing they accidentally approved same-sex unions by voting for the new bill that recognizes: “The right to recognition without discrimination contrary to human dignity, social and economic effects of domestic partnerships that constitute publicly, notoriously unique and stable, with legal capacity for marriage for more than three years” And they’re freaking out. Lawmaker Manrique Oviedo of the PAC (Citizen Action Party) is urging President Laura Chinchilla to veto the bill, stating that he “feels deceived” and “he made a mistake” when he voted for it, according to Amelia Rueda Al Aire. Justo Orozco, of the Costa Rican Renovation party, said the case would have to be looked into since “you can't give rights to those who don’t deserve them.” Yet, according to Lawmaker Jose Maria Villalta, a member of the leftist Broad Front Party , the conservative lawmakers simply didn’t read the entire bill before approving it. He said this has now ‘opened the door for recognizing the rights of same-sex unions,’ according to SDP Noticias. If the bill passes Costa Rica would join the five Latin American countries that have approved same-sex unions. Brazil was the most recent to do so on May 14, 2013.",

        "articles": "WASHINGTON -- Former senator Russ Feingold is giving a boost to Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) in her run for U.S. Senate on Wednesday, encouraging progressives to donate to her to fight back against \"Karl Rove, the Koch brothers, and big corporations.\" Feingold will be making his endorsement in an email to Baldwin's supporters on Wednesday. In the message, he cites her fights in Congress for the middle class and opposition to involvement in Iraq. \"I know Tammy has the values, the vision, and the guts to be a force the middle class in the U.S. Senate,\" he writes. \"We stood together against going to war in Iraq. And nearly 10 years before the financial collapse, we fought the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.\" \"These commonsense rules of the road prevented Wall Street and the big banks from making risky investments, and the end of those safeguards led to our economic crisis. Tammy has always put what is right for working Wisconsin families ahead of powerful special interests in Washington.\" In a statement to The Huffington Post, Baldwin said she was \"honored to have the support of Russ Feingold, a progressive champion who always puts Wisconsin's working and middle class families first.\" Baldwin is the only openly gay woman in Congress. If she wins her race in 2012, she will become the first openly gay person to serve in the U.S. Senate. Her campaign has already generated significant excitement from women's groups and LGBT organizations. Feingold's endorsement of Baldwin isn't entirely surprising, but it sends a strong signal to progressives that Wisconsin's Senate race will be one to watch -- and one that should build on a growing anti-Wall Street movement within the progressive community. In her statement announcing her candidacy, Baldwin said she believes \"Wisconsin families need a senator who will work hard to deliver results for the middle class -- a leader with the courage to do what's right, no matter how tough the odds or how powerful the special interests we have to fight.\" Feingold has long been an advocate for strong Wall Street reform and cleaning up corporations -- he opposed the Dodd-Frank legislation because it didn't go far enough and called on Democrats to stop taking corporate contributions. The only other non-incumbent endorsement Feingold has made in 2012 is his backing of Elizabeth Warren, who is running for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. In his email endorsement of Warren, Feingold also stressed that she \"stood up against the Wall Street wish list of a bankruptcy bill\" and would \"keep fighting for middle class families on Capitol Hill.\" \"Tammy is a true progressive champion, one of the strongest fighters for working families our state has ever produced and a hero to those of us who believe in breaking barriers and eliminating injustice in our society,\" adds Feingold, who also asks supporters to contribute to the Baldwin campaign. \"I was proud to call her a colleague as we fought together in Washington for Wisconsin families -- and I’ll be proud to call her my Senator.\" In August, Feingold announced that he would not be seeking elected office in 2012, clearing the field for Baldwin to become the frontrunner in the Senate race. Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.) is retiring, creating an open seat. The GOP field is more crowded, with former governor Tommy Thompson, Wisconsin state Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald and former congressman Mark Neumann all running. Several others are rumored to possibly jump in. Feingold is now running Progressives United, an organization aimed at mitigating the effects of -- and eventually overturning -- the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. It has launched advocacy campaigns calling out corporate corruption and has given money to progressive candidates. Feingold's Full Email: SUBJ: In Tammy's corner SENDER: Russ Feingold Dear Friend, Today, I’m proud to stand with a candidate who will keep the fight for progress, the middle class, and equality alive in the U.S. Senate: our good friend, Tammy Baldwin. But with Karl Rove, the Koch brothers, and big corporations already on the attack, we’ll need to fight back now --Tammy needs all of us in her corner. Join me in supporting Tammy by making a contribution today to help her build her grassroots campaign! I know Tammy has the values, the vision, and the guts to be a force for the middle class in the U.S. Senate. We stood together against going to war in Iraq. And nearly 10 years before the financial collapse, we fought the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. These commonsense rules of the road prevented Wall Street and the big banks from making risky investments, and the end of those safeguards led to our economic crisis. Tammy has always put what is right for working Wisconsin families ahead of powerful special interests in Washington. And we know those same powerful special interests will spend a lot of money to keep Tammy out of the United States Senate. So please join me in standing with Tammy by sending a contribution right now! Tammy is a true progressive champion, one of the strongest fighters for working families our state has ever produced and a hero to those of us who believe in breaking barriers and eliminating injustice in our society. I was proud to call her a colleague as we fought together in Washington for Wisconsin families -- and I’ll be proud to call her my Senator. Thanks for helping us fight to keep moving Wisconsin forward. All the best, Russ Correction: This post previously referred to Tommy Thompson as a former senator instead of a former governor.

        "articles": "Dominion Voting Systems on Monday filed a lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, alleging former President Donald Trump’s personal attorney defamed the voting software company with incessant lies about election fraud. The 107-page lawsuit, first reported by The New York Times, was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and accuses Giuliani of having “manufactured and disseminated” false claims that Dominion voting machines threw out or changed votes for Trump. This “Big Lie” of a stolen election “deceived millions of people into believing Dominion had stolen their votes and fixed the election,” the lawsuit alleged. Giuliani “cashed in” on those defamatory claims by reportedly seeking $20,000 a day from the Trump campaign and hosting a podcast where he repeatedly peddled the lies, the lawsuit contended. “Even after the United States Capitol had been stormed by rioters who had been deceived by Giuliani and his allies, Giuliani shirked responsibility for the consequences of his words and repeated the Big Lie,” the lawsuit stated. Dominion, headquartered in Denver and Toronto, is seeking $1.3 billion in damages. Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Scoop: Dominion Voting Systems has sued Rudy Giuliani for his false claims over the election. Seeking $1.3 billion.NYT story:  Dominion has also taken legal actions against other Trump allies who helped the ex-president peddle outrageous and baseless conspiracy theories involving the company. Earlier this month, Dominion sued former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell for $1.3 billion over her accusations that the company’s machines rigged the election in favor of President Joe Biden. Dominion sent a cease and desist letter to MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a Trump confidante, ordering him to “preserve and retain all documents relating to Dominion and your smear campaign against the company” and promised “imminent” litigation. In December, a Dominion worker filed lawsuits against several parties who pushed the stolen election lie, including Trump and conservative media outlets OAN and Newsmax, claiming the falsehoods led to death threats. One of the lies spread by Giuliani and other Trump allies makes the demonstrably false claim that Dominion was founded in Venezuela to rig elections in favor of dictator Hugo Chávez. In fact, Dominion was founded in 2002 “in John Poulos’s basement in Toronto to help blind people vote on paper ballots,” Dominion stated in its lawsuit. Dominion machines were used in at least 24 states during the 2020 election, including in states where Trump won. Dozens of prominent attorneys in New York state have called for Giuliani’s censure for his role in inspiring the Jan. 6 insurrectionist mob attack against the Capitol. The chairman of the New York state Senate judiciary committee called for the state court system to disbar Giuliani. On Thursday, a national group of lawyers filed a lengthy ethics complaint against Giuliani that alleged he knowingly lied about the election. The nonpartisan group Lawyers Defending American Democracy urged the state of New York to investigate Giuliani’s actions and suspend his law license in the meantime.

        "articles": "RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will not rush through a Supreme Court choice to replace Justice Antonin Scalia this week but will wait to nominate a candidate until the U.S. Senate is back in session, the White House said on Sunday. \"Given that the Senate is currently in recess, we don’t expect the president to rush this through this week, but instead will do so in due time once the Senate returns from their recess,\" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. \"At that point, we expect the Senate to consider that nominee, consistent with their responsibilities laid out in the United States Constitution,\" he said. Obama is traveling in California and returns to Washington on Tuesday. The Senate returns from recess on Feb. 22. Making a recess appointment would have been extremely controversial. The White House declined to give a more specific timeline for Obama to announce his nominee. For his previous two Supreme Court picks, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the president took about 30 days each to announce his selection after their predecessors, Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice David Souter, respectively, said they planned to step down. In remarks honoring Scalia on Saturday, Obama made clear he would not succumb to pressure from Republicans to leave the selection of a new justice to his successor. The president, who leaves office in January 2017, said he would make his choice in due time. \"These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone. They’re bigger than any one party. They are about our democracy,\" he said. \"They’re about the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life, and making sure it continues to function as the beacon of justice that our founders envisioned.\" Scalia's death and the upcoming fight over his replacement gives the White House an unexpected shot at shifting the balance of power on the Supreme Court in what would be a legacy-defining act during his last year in office. It also keeps the president from slipping quickly into \"lame duck\" status during an election year. White House officials are unlikely to drag out the process of announcing Obama's choice. \"They should move with dispatch,\" said David Axelrod, Obama's former senior adviser. To rebut Republican arguments, the White House points to a host of previous Supreme Court nominees who have received speedy hearings and votes regardless of which party had control in Congress.
