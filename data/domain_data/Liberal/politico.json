Biden, speaking Thursday night at the American Constitution Society convention a few blocks from the White House, didn't squarely endorse Clinton. But he made his preferences clear in what seemed like an unplanned aside amid remarks about the need to confirm fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans have refused to grant a hearing to Obama's nominee, federal judge Merrick Garland, let alone a floor vote. \"Keep in mind, we have another entire term of this potential confusion if the vote is not allowed this year. Anybody who thinks that whatever the next president — and God willing, in my view, it'll be Secretary Clinton,\" Biden said. \"Now, I don't say that for political reasons, but whoever it is, even if it is a Democrat, the idea this will be brought up within a month or two or three is highly unlikely.\" Biden, who was considering a White House bid of his own before the death of his son Beau, had remained steadfastly neutral in the Democratic primary, though at times he seemed to favor Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' broadsides about the \"billionaire class\" and an economy rigged against the \"99 percent.\" In January, Biden praised Sanders' focus on inequality and said it was “relatively new for Hillary to talk about” those sorts of issues. “Hillary’s focus has been other things up to now, and that’s been Bernie’s — no one questions Bernie’s authenticity on those issues,” Biden said. The vice president never fully abandoned his own presidential ambitions, telling ABC's Robin Roberts in May, \"I think I would have been the best president.\" Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "A majority of those polled said Donald Trump would not make wise decisions about war and peace. | AP Photo By LOUIS NELSON 11/16/2016 09:06 AM EST Less than 30 percent of Americans say Donald Trump has a mandate to carry out as president the agenda he proposed on the campaign trail, according to a Washington Post/Schar School poll released Wednesday. Just 29 percent said Trump has a mandate to accomplish all that he set out during his White House bid, while 59 percent said he should compromise with Democrats, who are the minority party in both houses of Congress, on issues where they strongly disagree. Fifty-six percent of respondents who said they voted for Trump said he should push his agenda through Congress without the help of Democrats. More than 60 percent of those polled said they expect to see major changes in Washington once Trump takes office. In comparison, 50 percent of Americans said President Barack Obama had a mandate when he was first elected to the White House in 2008, and 41 percent said the same of President George W. Bush when he was elected in 2000, the pollsters said. The latter campaign rivals 2016’s as the most divisive in modern U.S. history. A majority of those polled said Trump would not make wise decisions about war and peace, with 51 percent saying they were either “not so confident” or “not at all confident” in the Manhattan billionaire on that question, while 47 percent said they were either very or somewhat confident. Fifty-two percent expressed confidence that Trump will serve effectively as president, while 45 percent said they were not confident that he will. On the question of whether Trump should fulfill his campaign promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton for wrongdoing, Trump’s supporters diverge from the country overall. Sixty-nine percent of those who backed the president-elect said he should follow through on the pledge, while 57 percent of respondents overall said he should not. Seventy-three percent of respondents said the campaign made them angry, while 55 percent said news coverage of it made them feel stressed out. The poll put Obama’s approval rating at 56 percent, roughly the same level at which it has been since last June. Just 28 percent of respondents said they strongly disapprove of his job performance, the lowest that number has been in more than five years. Despite that, almost 90 percent of Trump supporters polled said they were dissatisfied with the U.S. in recent years, and roughly 80 percent said “large-scale changes” are necessary for the government. The Washington Post-Schar School poll was conducted from Nov. 11-14, reaching 1,002 adults across the U.S. on landlines and cellphones. The margin of error for the full sample size was plus or minus 4 percentage points. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Former Trump aide Hope Hicks repeatedly denied during testimony before the House Judiciary Committee last month that she was ever present when Donald Trump and Michael Cohen discussed Stormy Daniels. | Alex Wong/Getty Images legal New information raises questions about whether former White House communications director misled the Judiciary Committee during a closed-door interview last month. By DARREN SAMUELSOHN 07/18/2019 04:43 PM EDT Updated 07/19/2019 11:23 AM EDT The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday demanded Hope Hicks return for a second round of questioning within the next month to clarify what it described as \"inconsistent\" testimony she gave about Donald Trump's hush-money payments to an adult film actress. Democratic panel chairman Jerry Nadler in a five-page letter cited newly released court documents that raise questions about whether the former White House communications director and longtime Trump aide misled his panel about her role in the scheme during a closed-door interview last month. \"As I reminded you at the outset of your interview, anything other than complete candor can have very serious consequences,\" Nadler said in the letter to Hicks, which set an August 15 deadline for her to voluntarily return for additional questioning otherwise he'd issue a subpoena. At issue is testimony Hicks gave in June before Nadler's panel about what she knew concerning the payments made to the actress, Stormy Daniels, in a bid to silence her story before Election Day 2016. Hicks told the committee she had no direct knowledge of the payments and that she didn't have any contact during the presidential campaign with several of the key participants, including Keith Davidson, a lawyer for Daniels, and executives at American Media, Inc., the parent organization of the National Enquirer that was planning to buy the actress's story to bury it. She also told the House panel that she was never present for discussions about the issue involving Trump and Michael Cohen, the Trump attorney who is now serving a three-year prison sentence in part for his role in violating campaign finance laws tied to the payments to Daniels. In his letter to Hicks, Nadler said her testimony on each of her statements dealing with the issue \"appears to be inconsistent with the evidence\" released earlier Thursday in newly unsealed portions of the FBI's search warrants on Cohen. One example Nadler cited from the search warrant involves an early October 2016 phone call between Hicks, Trump and Cohen as the presidential candidate and his attorney were beginning negotiations on a deal to try and keep Daniels from going public with the allegations about an affair with Trump. According to the document, Hicks called Cohen on Oct. 8, 2016. Sixteen seconds later, Trump himself was dialed into the call, which continued for over four minutes. The FBI agent said it was the first call Cohen had received or made to Hicks in at least multiple weeks, and Cohen and Trump had spoken only about once a month prior to that. Cohen and Hicks then spoke again for about two minutes after the call with Trump ended. Several other examples of Hicks' involvement are also in the court records released Thursday, including testimony from an FBI agent who said she was part of a series of calls, text messages and emails about the payments to Daniels with Trump, Cohen, Davidson and the American Media executives, David Pecker and Dylan Howard. Chronological accounts from the FBI agents also describe Hicks communicating with the same group of people about the Daniels payments, as well as their anticipation of a separate Wall Street Journal story that was about to publish that detailed another alleged Trump affair with Karen McDougal, a Playboy model that the National Enquirer had also paid $150,000 to bury her story. Hicks’ participation in all of those moments, coming as Trump’s campaign was scrambling to bury the women's stories in the final weeks of a tumultuous 2016 presidential race, puts her in an awkward spot to explain her closed-door congressional testimony last month. In that private interview, Hicks gave a categorical denial to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) when she asked whether Hicks was ever present when Trump and Cohen had discussed Daniels. “No, ma’am,” Hicks replied. “You were never present when they discussed Stormy Daniels?” Jackson Lee asked again, according to a transcript released by the panel. “No,” Hicks answered. Jackson Lee then pressed a third time. “I’m going to say it again. Were you ever present when Trump and Mr. Cohen discussed Stormy Daniels, since it was all over the news that that occurred?” the lawmaker asked. After a White House attorney, Patrick Philbin, interjected to ensure the question to Hicks was focused only on her time on the Trump campaign, Hicks again replied, “So, no is my answer.” Also in the interview, Tennessee Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen asked Hicks directly if she had \"no knowledge - any information about hush money payments to Ms. Stormy Daniels. How about to Ms. - was it - McDougal, Miss August?\" Hicks replied, \"I wasn't aware of anything. I wasn't aware of a hush payment agreement.\" Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or updates from  and you agree to our privacy policy and terms of service.

She also testified that she didn't have \"any direct knowledge\" about the payments made to Daniels during the campaign. Asked when she learned about the payments to the actress, Hicks replied in questioning from the committee's lawyers that she did not recall speaking to Cohen about the Daniels episode \"other than to relay what the reporter said to me, that she would be mentioned in [a] story, but there was no additional context.\" \"I know the president had conversations with Michael separate from me, so it's possible it was part of those. I don't recall being part of those conversations,\" Hicks added. Hicks’ responses to the House committee also appears to conflict with what an FBI special agent wrote in support of the bureau’s request for search warrants of Cohen’s home, office and hotel room. In a footnote about the Trump-Cohen-Hicks call, the agent described a conversation with another official from the bureau who had interviewed Hicks. “I have learned that Hicks stated, in substance, that to the best of her recollection, she did not learn about the allegations made by [Daniels] until early November 2016,” the agent wrote. “Hicks was not specifically asked about this three-way call.” On Friday, Robert Trout, a lawyer for Hicks, issued a statement addressing the testimony. “Reports claiming that Ms. Hicks was involved in conversations about 'hush money' payments on October 8, 2016, or knew that payments were being discussed, are simply wrong,\" Trout said. \"Ms. Hicks stands by her truthful testimony that she first became aware of this issue in early November 2016, as the result of press inquiries, and she will be responding formally to Chairman Nadler’s letter as requested.” The new questions about Hicks’ testimony come as some in Trump’s orbit are starting to breathe a little easier. Audrey Strauss, lead U.S. attorney in New York handling Cohen’s case, sent a letter to a federal judge earlier this week that the government’s probe had concluded into who else might be criminally liable for the campaign finance violations to which Cohen pleaded guilty. Strauss also said the Manhattan-based investigation into whether anyone else gave false statements or obstructed justice is over. While the New York-based federal prosecutor made no mention about additional charges, several legal experts told  on Wednesday that the government’s confirmation that it has closed its investigation suggests no one else from the Trump Organization faces legal liability. “Case closed,” Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow said in a text message to  on Thursday. But others aren’t so sure Hicks is in the clear. \"Looks like Hope Hicks lied during Congressional investigation when we at @HouseJudiciary interviewed her,\" tweeted Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), who sits on the judiciary panel. \"That's two felonies: Perjury & Obstruction of Justice. Hicks consulted with lawyers throughout her interview. Did @TheJusticeDept or @WhiteHouse lawyers know she was lying?\" Added Bradley Moss, a Washington-based national security attorney, “I’m going to be surprised if there isn’t a 1001 violation referral for Hope Hicks by the end of tomorrow. It appears rather clear she lied to Congress about the Stormy Daniels saga.” He was referring to the federal statute prohibiting material false statements. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Mary Altaffer/AP Photo Law And Order His case is still alive. It could test the limits of pardon powerâand not just for Trump. By RICHARD PRIMUS October 04, 2017 Richard Primus is the Theodore J. St. Antoine Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School. Follow him on Twitter @Richard_Primus. Joe Arpaio is back. Today, a federal judge will hear arguments in the continuing case of United States v. Joseph M. Arpaioâthe case in which Donald Trump issued his first presidential pardon. To many people, it might be strange to realize the case is continuing at all. Normally, a pardon is the end of a criminal case, or an epilogue. But the controversial sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizonaâconvicted of criminal contempt of courtâhas decided to try to clear his name, asking a court to vacate his original conviction entirely. (Normally, a pardon protects the pardoned person from punishment, but leaves the fact of the conviction on the books.) Arpaio might indeed get his record wiped clean. But in asking a court to vacate his conviction, Arpaio is inviting another possibility as well: that the court will decide his pardon was not valid in the first place. If that happens, the pardon would mark a new development in the law: judicial willingness to limit the presidential pardon power itself. For a long time, the conventional wisdom has been that a president could grant a pardon for any reason, and that a presidential pardon for a federal crime could not be challenged in court. But that view of the pardon power is not stated anywhere in the Constitution. Article II, Section 2 says the president âshall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.â It doesnât say ââ¦ and any pardon the president grants is absolute and unreviewable.â Rather than being a rule stated in the Constitution, the assumption that presidential pardons canât be overturned by courts is a matter of long-standing convention. There are reasons why such a convention is attractive: A pardon is an act of mercy, and there is something dissonant about picking apart acts of mercy in the courtroom. But treating the pardon power as absolute also has downsides, because any absolute power can be exercised irresponsibly. The convention, therefore, is partly built on the judiciaryâs confidence that presidents exercise the pardon power responsiblyâor at least that whatever abuses occur are within tolerable bounds. So for the courts to deem a pardon invalid would be a departure from convention. But the Arpaio pardon itself is highly unconventional, maybe sufficiently so to make the courts doubt that we are still in the realm of either responsible uses of the pardon power of even tolerable abuses of it. One of the unusual things about the Arpaio pardon is that the crime for which Arpaio was convicted isnât based on a statute. It arises directly from the Constitution. In prior proceedings, federal courts ordered Arpaio to cease a set of unconstitutional racial profiling practices that the Department of Justice identified as the worst in American history. Arpaio was then convicted of criminal contempt when he refused to comply with those court orders. In other words, Arpaio systematically violated the constitutional rights of large numbers of individuals, and he was then prosecuted and convicted for persisting after the courts told him to stop. So by pardoning him, Trump did not merely forgive an offense against a federal statute: He forgave a refusal to respect rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It's impossible to know what the Arizona judge will decide in Arpaio's case, but there are already indications it's being treated as something of a big deal. Rather than granting or denying the request, the court scheduled an actual oral argument. That's not normal, and it's something a court would do only if it thought there was a serious issue to work through. Public interest groups have filed amicus curiae briefs arguing that the court should invalidate the underlying pardonâwhich won't necessarily sway the judge's action, but does put the issue formally on the table. What little case law exists on the limits of the pardon power seems to recognize a distinction between pardoning offenses against statutes passed in the general public interest and pardoning offenses against the rights of particular individuals. In his opinion for the Supreme Court in Ex parte Grossman, a 1925 decision upholding a pardon in a criminal-contempt case, Chief Justice (and former pardon-power wielder) William Howard Taft noted that the petitioner had been convicted of violating a statute passed to vindicate a general public interestâthe National Prohibition Actârather than of doing anything that violated the rights of some discrete other person. Implicit in that opinion is the idea that the president might not have the power to release a claim for justice held by a private person. Once this logic is in view, itâs easy to read the text of Article II itself as limiting the pardon power along the very lines that Chief Justice Taft described. Article II grants the president power to pardon offenses âagainst the United States.â But not, perhaps, offenses against individual Americans. And Arpaioâs underyling offense is the systematic violation of individual constitutional rights. The point here isnât that the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 chose the language âoffenses against the United Statesâ as a deliberate way of preventing presidents from pardoning crimes rooted in the violation of individual constitutional rights. Such a thing could probably never have occurred to the convention delegates because the Constitution they drafted included few if any individual rights that government officials could conceivably be prosecuted for violating. The specification of individual rights came later, with the amendments. The point, rather, is that the broad deference we give to the presidentâs pardon power is based on the assumption that the president observes certain limitsâand once those limits are no longer respected, lawyers and judges will have little trouble finding authority to support the idea that the pardon power has limits. Invalidating a pardon on the grounds that it undermined guaranteed constitutional rights would be something new, but it would fit comfortably within a set of well-established general principles. Most grants of power in the Constitution are limited by other parts of the Constitution, and thereâs no reason to see the presidential pardon differently. Courts are, as a general matter, charged with enforcing our guaranteed rights against abuses of the powers the Constitution grants to the other branches of government. The reason for courts not to go down this road is, of course, the value of trusting the president to use certain powers without judicial review. Maybe weâd be better off if courts just stayed out of the way, even at the risk of periodic abuses. In the long run, the constitutional system cannot function if the people who hold office canât be trusted to exercise their powers responsibly; a government in which judges second-guessed everything might be as nightmarish as it would be unworkable. But when two institutions have a convention of mutual self-restraintâI donât abuse my powers, and you leave me alone to exercise themâthen itâs perfectly foreseeable for a failure of self-restraint on one side to provoke a less restrained stance on the other. Trump has consistently refused to abide by conventions that have traditionally shaped the relationship between the judiciary and the chief executive. His public stance on Arpaioâs conviction transgresses another such convention: by suggesting that Arpaio was merely âconvicted for doing his job,â Trump charged that the court was out of line to convict him. Thatâs both an insult to the court and a departure from settled understandings about the nature of pardonsâ which are traditionally understood as acts of grace granted to the penitent guilty, rather than as vindications of the righteous and indictments of the courts that convicted them. If the courts decide that Trumpâs aggressive use of the pardon power requires them to be less restrained, Trumpâs attempt to pardon Arpaio might have the effect of narrowing the scope of the pardon power in the future, both for him and for presidents who follow. Or he could respond to a judicial invalidation of Arpaioâs pardon with yet a further escalation of his conflict with the courtsâwhich could provoke a further escalation after that, and problems that no pardon could possibly resolve.

        "articles": "Paul Manafort has also filed a motion to dismiss a criminal case he faces in federal court in Virginia involving tax and bank-fraud charges. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images By JOSH GERSTEIN 05/15/2018 05:09 PM EDT Updated 05/16/2018 12:28 PM EDT A federal judge on Tuesday rejected an attempt by Paul Manafort, a former Trump campaign chairman, to get an indictment against him dismissed by claiming that special counsel Robert Mueller’s appointment was flawed. In a blow to Manafort’s defense, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that Mueller’s prosecution of the longtime political consultant on charges of money laundering and failing to register as a foreign agent for Ukraine was “squarely” within the authority that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein granted to Mueller last May. “The indictment falls squarely within that portion of the authority granted to the Special Counsel that Manafort finds unobjectionable: the order to investigate ‘any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign,’” Jackson wrote. “Manafort was, at one time, not merely ‘associated with,’ but the chairman of, the Presidential campaign, and his work on behalf of the Russia-backed Ukrainian political party and connections to other Russian figures are matters of public record,” the judge added in her 37-page ruling. “It was logical and appropriate for investigators tasked with the investigation of ‘any links’ between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign to direct their attention to him.” Citing press reports that Manafort filed with the court discussing his activities abroad, Jackson suggested it would have been malpractice for Mueller not to have investigated him.

Jackson, however, said Manafort’s arguments were not persuasive for several reasons. First, she said, the subjects that Manafort was indicted for the case she was overseeing were part of Mueller’s core focus, not some expansion of it. Second, she said, outsiders don’t have the authority to enforce the special counsel regulations, because they’re internal Justice Department policies. And third, she found that Rosenstein has validated the indictment through continuing consultation with and supervision of Mueller. \"Paul Manafort maintains his innocence and looks forward to prevailing in this matter,” his spokesman Jason Malong said in a statement reacting to the ruling. Jackson, an appointee of President Barack Obama, has imposed a gag order limiting public comments by prosecutors, defense attorneys and Manafort. Manafort’s defense team has appeared more hopeful about a similar motion to dismiss filed against another criminal case Mueller brought against Manafort in Virginia on charges of bank fraud, tax evasion and failing to report foreign bank accounts. The judge in that case, T.S. Ellis III, gave Manafort’s defense a much-needed boost earlier this month by expressing skepticism about Mueller’s authority to pursue charges with no obvious connection to Russia. Ellis, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, seized on the fact that the alleged fraud in the Virginia case dated back to 2005, about a decade before the Trump campaign came into existence. That arguably makes the case more factually removed from Mueller’s central mandate. By CRISTIANO LIMA Manafort could still lose his motion if Ellis agrees with Jackson that the special counsel regulations can’t be enforced by defendants or finds that Rosenstein approved an expansion of Mueller’s authority for the bank and tax fraud charges. Even if the judge does find a violation, it’s possible he won’t dismiss the case but will simply reassign it to federal prosecutors in Virginia. Still, any ruling from Ellis that Mueller overstepped his authority is certain to be celebrated not only by Manafort, but also by Trump and his supporters. Indeed, after Ellis’ criticism of Mueller’s team at the hearing earlier this month, Trump seized on the statements, reading them aloud from the stage at a speech he was delivering in Texas. Ellis has not yet issued a ruling on Manafort’s motion, but the judge set a deadline of this Friday for Mueller’s office to file with the court an August 2017 memo laying out the designated scope of the special counsel’s investigation. Ellis is not obliged to follow Jackson‘s ruling or her rationale, but her opinion could influence his and he is likely to explain any distinction or disagreement with her decision. At least one passage in Jackson's ruling seemed like it might have been directed at Ellis. She said Manafort's core argument was that \"the Special Counsel has embarked on an unfettered and unsupervised investigation.\" Manafort's attorneys never used exactly those words, but they did track closely with one of Ellis's most pithy comments at the hearing he held earlier this month. \"What we don't want in this country, we don't want anyone with unfettered power,\" declared Ellis. The Virginia case is currently set for trial July 10, with a Washington trial for Manafort set to follow Sept. 17. Missing out on the latest scoops?

But the move came under attack from Democrats and former law enforcement officials who accused Giuliani of trying to pressure a foreign government to target Biden, who's running for president, ahead of the 2020 election. Giuliani also said he hoped to discuss a Ukrainian investigation into the origins of the FBI probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. “Today, Giuliani admitted to seeking political help from a foreign power. Again,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff wrote on Twitter. 2020 elections By ELIANA JOHNSON, DARREN SAMUELSOHN, ANDREW RESTUCCIA and DANIEL LIPPMAN The former New York City mayor told  he was planning to leave Sunday and return Wednesday. But late Friday, Giuliani said he had canceled his trip, explaining his change of plans in a text message that the original offer for a meeting was a “set up” orchestrated by “several vocal critics” of Trump who are advising Ukraine’s new president-elect. “Only got name yesterday and told pres elect is in hands of avowed enemies of Pres Trump,” Giuliani wrote. “Useless meeting.” “It is all part of one large conspiracy that has a two or three parts to it. … So I’ve decided I’m not going to go because I’m walking into a group of people that are enemies of the president,” Giuliani said on Fox News Friday night. On Saturday morning, Giuliani sought to further explain his decision in another text message to . “I concluded that the President elect is being advised by people who were very vocal opponents of President Trump and peculiarly vocal supporters of Hillary Clinton,” he said, offering no evidence for his claim. In a telephone interview with  on Friday, Trump said he didn’t know much about Giuliani’s planned trip to Ukraine, but wanted to speak with him about it. “I have not spoken to him at any great length, but I will,” Trump said in the interview. “I will speak to him about it before he leaves.” 2020 Elections By MARC CAPUTO Separately, the president said he felt it “would be an appropriate thing” to speak to Attorney General Bill Barr about launching an investigation into Biden, or his son, Hunter, over their actions in Ukraine. But the president said he has not done so. Still, the comment was swiftly rebuked as a trampling of the long-held norms that the White House does not influence Justice Department decisions. The Bidens’ connections to Ukraine have become a subject of deep interest among the president’s political allies, who charge that Biden as vice president during the Obama administration pressured the Ukrainian government to oust a prosecutor in order to benefit his son. No evidence has emerged that Joe Biden was acting to assist his son, and it is not clear that the official was even probing the Hunter Biden-linked company at the time. The Biden campaign declined to comment, but has previously said that Biden acted properly as vice president and only learned of his son’s role with the Ukrainian company through news reports. Hunter Biden has also previously said he has no connection to the investigation of the company, Burisma Holdings. The New York Times earlier this week reported that prosecutors for the outgoing Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, had opened investigations into the origins of the Russia probe and the Ukrainian energy company, which Hunter Biden at one time did work for. The status of the investigations under the incoming Ukrainian president is unclear. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Elizabeth Warren called Trump a “union buster” and ridiculed him as a “climate change denier.” | AP Photo By LOUIS NELSON 06/04/2016 12:30 PM EDT Updated 06/04/2016 02:57 PM EDT Donald Trump is an “insecure money-grubber,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren told assembled Massachusetts Democrats at the party’s state convention Saturday. He is also, according to Warren’s prepared remarks: scary, loud, outrageous, offensive, small, a failure and fraudster in chief. Those are just a handful of the bombs Warren hurled Trump’s way in her Saturday afternoon address, after which she told reporters that she doesn’t believe in the superdelegate process and has “no timetable” for making an endorsement in the Democratic presidential race. During her speech, the Massachusetts senator attacked Trump on issues ranging from climate change to Wall Street to women. Warren spent significant time echoing recent attacks by Hillary Clinton on Trump University, the Republican presumptive nominee’s troubled real-estate seminar program. “It was like a used-car dealership — except that’s not fair to used-car dealerships,” Warren said of Trump University. “His playbook said to look for people with problems; they make good targets.” “These were ordinary folks who were targeted because they had problems and Trump saw they were vulnerable and he could make a buck,” she continued. “Here’s a man who builds a business to profit off other peoples’ pain. He wants to be commander in chief, but he’s only qualified to be fraudster in chief.” Warren, who has not officially endorsed a candidate in the Democratic primary, said that she is “proud of the debate that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have had. Proud that we are a party that doesn’t debate over who has the tiniest hands or who can build the longest, tallest, stupidest wall between us and Mexico.” From there, Warren launched into a laundry list of Trump’s policies, highlighting areas in which the GOP candidate’s views differ from hers and her party’s. She called Trump a “union buster” and ridiculed him as a “climate change denier.” She said he is “all about money.” “These are the values we fight for,” Warren said. “These are the values that will beat Donald Trump.” After her speech, Warren told reporters she doesn’t believe in her party’s superdelegate process. “I’m a superdelegate, and I don’t believe in superdelegates,” Warren said in comments that came after the state party voted on a resolution to “thoroughly, objectively, and transparently” study the superdelegate process ahead of the 2020 presidential race. Warren said she agreed that the process should be scrutinized. Asked whether Sanders should leave the race next week, Warren demurred. “Sanders has brought a lot of energy to this campaign, and that is a decision for Bernie Sanders to make,” she said. Asked whether her role is to unite the party, the senator replied, “I think the party is united.” “I’m in this fight all the way to try to stop Donald Trump,” she said, adding that she is “going to try to help out every way I can.” Lauren Dezenski contributed to this report.

        "articles": "Protesters expresses criticism at a round table event with Sen. Joni Ernst on Feb. 21 in Maquoketa, Iowa. | AP Photo By STEVEN SHEPARD 02/22/2017 06:46 AM EST The 2010 health care law is becoming more popular, even as it heads toward the chopping block — further complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal and replace it. While both Trump and Republicans in both chambers of Congress campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act — passed exclusively with Democratic votes and signed by then-President Barack Obama — a new /Morning Consult poll shows voters are now split evenly on the law. Forty-five percent of registered voters approve of the law, the poll shows, and 45 percent disapprove. In early January, before Trump took office, a /Morning Consult poll showed only 41 percent of voters approved of the health care law, compared with 52 percent who disapproved. And now there’s little consensus on what Congress and the Trump administration should do next. Only 12 percent want to keep the law in place, while 24 percent want to repeal it entirely. But there’s a sharp divide between the 27 percent who want to repeal parts of the law, but not all of it — and the 26 percent who want to expand the existing law. By JENNIFER HABERKORN \"As the threat of the Affordable Care Act’s repeal has moved from notional to concrete, our weekly polling has shown an uptick in the law’s popularity, and fewer voters support repealing the law,” said Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult’s co-founder and chief research officer. Voters are also opposed to repealing many individual aspects of the law. Of nine separate provisions of the law tested in the poll, more poll respondents want to repeal only one — the individual mandate that Americans purchase health insurance — than want to keep it. Other provisions are resoundingly popular. Nearly two-thirds of voters, 65 percent, want to keep prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions, including 59 percent of Republicans. Sixty-three percent want to keep allowing those younger than 26 years of age to stay on their parents’ plan, including 56 percent of Republicans. Voters even want to keep provisions of the law opposed by most Republicans. Only a quarter want to repeal requiring businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to provide health insurance, while 59 percent want to keep it. Just 28 percent want to repeal requirements that insurance companies cover birth-control medication, and 55 percent want to keep it. And one-third, 33 percent, want to repeal taxes on medical devices, while slightly more, 39 percent, want to keep those taxes in place. Health Care By BRIANNA EHLEY As anger and frustration over the health care law’s future builds among some constituents, many lawmakers are eschewing in-person town hall meetings during this week’s congressional recess — opting instead to host “tele-town halls,” an event format that allows participants to question members only over the phone. But voters still prefer the traditional, analog version of political engagement, the poll shows. Fifty-six percent of voters would prefer their member of Congress hold in-person town hall events, while only 20 percent prefer the tele-conferences. More generally, voters want Republicans in Congress to be a check and balance on Trump’s agenda, the poll shows. But even as some members hear from those voters at town hall meetings during this week’s recess, the poll also shows a majority of Republicans want GOP representatives to support Trump’s priorities, though not overwhelmingly. Overall, 53 percent of voters want congressional Republicans to “focus on being a check and balance” to Trump, while only 31 percent think they should focus on supporting Trump’s programs. Among self-identified GOP voters, 55 percent want Republicans to support Trump’s priorities, but a sizable, 37 percent share wants them to be a check and balance on Trump. The new survey — conducted last Thursday through Sunday — coincides with an early test of the precarious alliance between Trump’s administration and congressional Republicans. Washington And The World By JAMES KITFIELD Voters continue to divide sharply on views of Trump and his presidency. Trump’s approval rating in the /Morning Consult poll continues to tilt slightly positive — 48 percent of voters approve in the new survey, while 45 percent disapprove — but the share of the electorate that strongly disapproves (33 percent) is greater than the percentage that strongly approves (27 percent). And voters are also split on Trump personally: 47 percent have a favorable opinion of him, while 48 percent view him unfavorably. Trump does retain solid backing from GOP voters, however, which could inform congressional Republicans as they navigate the early months of Trump’s presidency. \"Trump has strong support from within his party: 85 percent of Republicans approve of the job he's doing,” Dropp said. “But that doesn't mean they're ready to give him carte blanche. Even four in 10 Republicans say congressional Republicans should serve as a check on Trump.” The poll surveyed 2,013 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

        "articles": "Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings, \"Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings.\" | Win McNamee/Getty Images Finance & Tax Under Secretary Wilbur Ross, the department is chaotic and adrift. By DANIEL LIPPMAN 07/22/2019 05:01 AM EDT Constant infighting among top officials. Sudden departures of senior staffers without explanation. A leader who is disengaged and prone to falling asleep in meetings. The Commerce Department has reached its apex of dysfunction under Wilbur Ross, according to four people with knowledge of the inner workings of the department. The 81-year-old Commerce secretary, who has for months endured whispers that he is on the outs, spends much of his time at the White House to try to retain President Donald Trump’s favor, the sources said, leaving his department adrift. He’s hardly the only top Trump official to seek the president’s approval. But department insiders say they’ve rarely seen Commerce so rudderless — and they say Ross’ penchant for managing upward at the expense of his staff is leading to what one plugged-in observer described as “a disaster over there.” “With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership to be effective, and right now they just don’t have it,” said Theo LeCompte, a former top Commerce official in the Obama administration who speaks often with former colleagues. One common complaint: Ross, a successful investor before Trump tapped him as secretary of Commerce, isn’t frequently seen in the building talking to employees or rallying them to do good work. “He’s sort of seen as kind of irrelevant. The morale is very low there because there’s not a lot of confidence in the secretary,” said a former outside adviser to Commerce who is still in touch with many employees at the department. “He’s not respected in the building.” Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings and a former outside adviser — a departure from past practice that one source attributed to the secretary’s lack of stamina. “Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they’re very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,” said the former outside adviser. “There’s a small window where he’s able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.” A Commerce official disputed that criticsm, saying that Ross has frequent afternoon meetings, including “long” meetings on the census.

A Commerce official disputed that and said, “He’s obviously going to have to testify again. … You can’t get through the rest of [congressional appropriations] season without testifying again.” Ross did testify at an oversight hearing on the census for nearly seven hours in March, and emerged through the ordeal generally unscathed. But according to one person familiar with the department, the consensus among the top ranks of the administration was that it would be best to avoid a repeat appearance. “There was a great deal of concern to not have him testify expressed from the White House,” this person said, characterizing the instructions as: “‘Don’t do this, people. Don’t do this, he’s probably not the right guy to go there.’” Ross certainly has other reasons to avoid Congress — namely, the heated dispute between Hill Democrats and the administration over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. In April, Ross offered to send aides to testify on his behalf before a House Appropriations subcommittee, an offer the panel’s Democratic chairman, José Serrano, said showed “stunning disrespect.” Serrano’s Republican counterpart, Robert Aderholt, told Reuters that Ross refused to testify out of “concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself.” “His relationship with the Hill has deteriorated more and more, and he’s just not interested in dealing with the Hill if he can avoid it,” said a person familiar with the department’s internal discussions. A Commerce official noted that Ross talked to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) two weeks ago, and held a party two months ago that a number of senators attended. Another Commerce employee observed, “This administration is very hesitant to do oversight in general or to comply with oversight requests in general.” There are public signs, however, of apparent unease with Ross as a spokesperson for the administration. At an appearance at the White House in mid-July on an announcement on abandoning the citizenship question in the census, the Commerce secretary stood next to Trump the entire time and was one of three people who didn’t speak. Attorney General Bill Barr, on the other hand, spoke at length. Ross’ relationship with the White House and with Trump was also damaged by stories that came out in the past 18 months showing that he wasn’t as rich as he had claimed and hadn’t fully divested some stock as he had promised, according to the former outside adviser. (The Commerce official disputed that, arguing that the White House has not cared about these issues.) Ross’s deputies, meanwhile, are coming under fire of their own as tensions rise withini the department. Political appointees sometimes close doors right in front of career employees to keep them out of meetings, one former Commerce official in touch with former colleagues said. Meanwhile, “it’s totally infighting among the politicals,” said another person familiar with the department. “It’s just everybody fighting everybody.” In particular, the relationship between Ross’ office and the legislative affairs team is “clearly broken,” this person said. Charles “Kolo” Rathburn, who had been acting head of legislative affairs, “was unceremoniously let go” and abruptly left earlier in July, according to a person familiar with Commerce and the outside adviser, who said it had to do with issues of professional conduct in the workplace. Another person familiar with Commerce also confirmed his departure. “He wasn’t allowed to clean out his office,” said one of the people. Rathburn had replaced Mike Platt, who had left in early May. A Commerce official said Rathburn, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, is working to pass the bar exam and has an offer for a higher-paying position at a law firm if he does. Ross Branson, who had been deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs and was Platt’s deputy, also left Commerce on Friday, according to two people familiar with his departure. He had become “collateral damage,” according to one of the people, and was told that he had to look for a new job. He starts on Monday as head of legislative affairs at the Export-Import Bank, a position that a Commerce official described as “definitely a promotion.” Branson and the Ex-Im Bank did not respond to a request for comment. Much of the tension inside the building has centered on Earl Comstock, who shepherded Ross’ confirmation on Capitol Hill and is one of the secretary’s top lieutenants as the department's policy director. The disarray inside Commerce is drawing an intervention from chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials, who are trying to figure out how to wrest control from Comstock, who increasingly seems to be involved in everything that happens inside the department. “Things come to a screeching halt because he demands to be the final decision on everything whether it’s an email that goes out to the Hill or a letter to respond to X, Y and Z,” said a person familiar with Commerce. Comstock, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, has also been at the center of many of the spectrum battles between the Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Transportation, Education, Commerce and NASA and NOAA, according to an administration official. He has “literally been seeding bad intel and bad information to get other people agitated,” said the official. He also tried to scuttle a joint White House-FCC summit on 5G, the wireless technology, in April by “calling everyone he could 24 hours before the event trying to get it to be canceled,” this person said. Comstock clashed in particular with former National Telecommunications and Information Administration chief David Redl, who left his post abruptly in May. Critics of Ross’ leadership at Commerce also have a new target of concern: chief of staff Michael Walsh, who is described by some as inexperienced on policy and difficult to work with. Walsh didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the Commerce official said that he has good relationships throughout the administration and on the Hill and visits the White House frequently. A second person familiar with Commerce also claimed, “People want his job so they’re spreading bad stuff on him.” The chaos inside the department has had consequences for some employees. “There’s great frustration among people who really want to use their skills and talents to help this country and are being marginalized by a White House who doesn’t need to ask any questions because it already thinks it has the answers,” said Roger Fisk, a Commerce official in the Obama administration. “All of that expertise is just lying dormant hiding in plain sight.\" Margaret Harding McGill and Nancy Cook contributed to this story.

Throughout his tenure, Trump and his administration have pursued a number of key issues backed by evangelicals, such as restricting abortion rights, eliminating a birth control mandate, and expanding school choice and voucher programs that would likely benefit private religious schools. Most recently, Trump in a tweet endorsed a controversial campaign to introduce Bible literacy classes to public schools.

His support with those voters hasn't faltered despite several gaffes, such as when he mispronounced “Second Corinthians\" during the 2016 campaign. The president was also criticized for not saying the Apostle’s Creed or singing some of the hymns during George H.W. Bush’s funeral in December. Trump's multiple divorces and alleged affairs have also not significantly affected the president’s popularity among white evangelical voters. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "In the days after President Donald Trump's Jan. 27 directive banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven-majority Muslim countries, about two dozen lawsuits were filed challenging its legality. | Getty Federal judge in Wisconsin blocks impact on Syrian family as other courts mull broader relief. By JOSH GERSTEIN 03/10/2017 01:17 PM EST Updated 03/10/2017 09:15 PM EST President Donald Trump’s revised travel ban executive order suffered its first legal setback Friday as a federal judge blocked the directive's potential impact on the family of a Syrian refugee living in Wisconsin. Madison-based U.S. District Court Judge William Conley issued a temporary retraining order at the request of the Syrian man, who is referred to as “John Doe” in court filings. The judge, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said Trump's new executive order cannot be used to delay the man’s effort to bring his wife and 3-year-old daughter from the wartorn country to the U.S., but is limited to the individuals involved in the case. “The court concludes that plaintiff has presented some likelihood of success on the merits and that he is at great risk of suffering irreparable harm if a temporary restraining order is denied,” Conley wrote. “The court appreciates that there may be important differences between the original executive order, and the revised executive order. ... As the order applies to the plaintiff here, however, the court finds his claims have at least some chance of prevailing for the reasons articulated by other courts.” “Moreover, given the daily threat to the lives to plaintiff’s wife and child remaining in Aleppo, Syria, the court further finds a significant risk of irreparable harm,” Conley wrote, blocking application of Trump's order to the affected family through March 21. “We’re obviously pleased with this order,” said Vincent Levy, a New York-based attorney representing the Syrian man. “Our client’s wife and child are in danger and it will take some time to get them here, so this is obviously helpful. ... It’s another indication that [Trump’s] order, even as revised, exceeds the scope of authority granted to the president and that it’s unconstitutional.” Justice Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling. The court showdown in Wisconsin was just one of at least five expected to play out in the coming days as various states, organizations and individuals try to block some or all of Trump’s redrafted travel ban order from taking effect as scheduled just after midnight Wednesday night. In Maryland, a federal judge set a hearing for Wednesday morning on a lawsuit brought by refugee aid groups. Another hearing is set to take place in front of a federal judge in Honolulu on a travel ban lawsuit brought by the state of Hawaii. In addition, the states of Washington and Minnesota asked Seattle-based U.S. District Court Judge James Robart to confirm that his existing injunction against key parts of Trump's original travel ban executive order blocks similar portions of the revised directive. However, Robart rebuffed that request Friday night, indicating that he wanted either a motion from the federal government to escape the injunction or a motion from the states to enforce it. “The court notes that there is no pending motion concerning the foregoing issues presently before the court,” Robart wrote. “The court declines to decide any of the issues raised in the parties’ filings until such time as one of the parties files a motion that is both properly noted under the court’s Local Rules and properly briefed.” The judge’s order also said he wants to see the states’ amend their lawsuit to address the new executive order before he makes any ruling on it. Lawyers involved in the Maryland case—brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the International Refugee Assistance Project and HIAS, a federally approved resettlement agency—say it’s possible the hearing in their case could be postponed or canceled if Seattle-based U.S. District Court Judge James Robart decides his existing injunction applies to Trump's new order.

In the days after Trump's Jan. 27 directive banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven-majority Muslim countries, about two dozen lawsuits were filed challenging its legality. At least five judges issued orders blocking parts of Trump's original order. Several of the states involved in those cases now appear to be lining up behind the Washington state-led suit, which obtained the most sweeping injunction against Trump's original travel ban directive. Oregon joined that case Thursday, while New York and Massachusetts officials have indicated plans to do so soon. That process could be sped up by Robart's order Friday night. Lawyers representing immigrants and immigrant advocacy groups in Washington state also filed Friday afternoon for a restraining order against Trump's revised order. That request was submitted to Robart, the same Seattle-based judge who's handling the case involving Washington and the other state governments. Trump has billed the travel ban orders as necessary to prevent terrorist attacks in the U.S., but critics say they're poorly tailored to achieve that goal and will result in an anti-American backlash abroad. The revised executive order Trump signed Monday trims Iraq off the list of affected countries and exempts existing visa-holders from the new restrictions. Missing out on the latest scoops?

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks at a news conference at the Capitol on Feb. 2, 2021. By MARIANNE LEVINE 02/03/2021 09:49 AM EST Updated: 02/03/2021 08:44 PM EST Link Copied Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reached a deal Wednesday on a power-sharing agreement for governing the upper chamber. The final agreement on the so-called organizing resolution for the evenly split Senate allows Democrats to take control of committees and comes after weeks of negotiation between the two leaders. The Senate approved the resolution later Wednesday. “I am happy to report this morning that the leadership of both parties have finalized the organizing resolution for the Senate,” Schumer said, adding that approval of the resolution \"means that committees can promptly set up and get to work.” In a statement, McConnell said that the \"power-sharing agreement is almost identical to the 2001 agreement and will allow the Senate to be fairly run as an evenly-split body.” The lack of an organizing resolution had created an unusual situation in the Senate, where Republicans still technically held committee gavels and were overseeing the confirmation process for President Joe Biden’s nominees, even though Democrats hold the majority. It also meant that new members of the Senate had not yet received their committee assignments. Schumer and McConnell have both announced new committee assignments. McConnell initially asked that Senate Democrats commit to protecting the legislative filibuster as part of the agreement, which Schumer rejected. McConnell dropped that demand after Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) publicly reiterated that they did not support eliminating the 60-vote threshold. As part of their agreement, Schumer pledged that he would not limit amendments, unless they are \"dilatory measures [that] prevent the Senate from taking action and leave no alternative.\" McConnell, meanwhile, said that he would seek to avoid \"lengthy debates\" on procedural votes for legislation with significant bipartisan support. In addition to the power-sharing agreement, Schumer announced that Sonceria “Ann” Berry will become Secretary of the Senate, starting March 1, replacing Julie Adams. Berry will be the first African-American and eighth woman to serve in the role. Replacing the Secretary of the Senate after winning the majority is not unusual for either party. The new agreement will resemble the 2001 power sharing agreement between former Senate leaders Trent Lott and Tom Daschle. That pact also took weeks to negotiate. But unlike this year, the 2001 accord was reached before then-newly elected President George W. Bush officially took office and there was no change in party control of the chamber. Senate Democrats did not win the majority until the Jan. 5 Georgia runoff races, when Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock both won Senate seats. Vice President Kamala Harris is the tie-breaking vote for Democrats. Link Copied © 2021  LLC",

        "articles": "Politics Why group marriage is the next horizon of social liberalism. By FREDRIK DEBOER June 26, 2015 Fredrik deBoer is a writer and academic. He lives in Indiana. Fredrik deBoer is a writer and academic. He lives in Indiana. Welcome to the exciting new world of the slippery slope. With the Supreme Courtâs landmark ruling this Friday legalizing same sex marriage in all 50 states, social liberalism has achieved one of its central goals. A right seemingly unthinkable two decades ago has now been broadly applied to a whole new class of citizens. Following on the rejection of interracial marriage bans in the 20th Century, the Supreme Court decision clearly shows that marriage should be a broadly applicable rightâone that forces the government to recognize, as Fridayâs decision said, a private coupleâs âlove, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family.â The question presents itself: Where does the next advance come? The answer is going to make nearly everyone uncomfortable: Now that weâve defined that love and devotion and family isnât driven by gender alone, why should it be limited to just two individuals? The most natural advance next for marriage lies in legalized polygamyâyet many of the same people who pressed for marriage equality for gay couples oppose it. This is not an abstract issue. In Chief Justice John Robertsâ dissenting opinion, he remarks, âIt is striking how much of the majorityâs reasoning would apply with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage.â As is often the case with critics of polygamy, he neglects to mention why this is a fate to be feared. Polygamy today stands as a taboo just as strong as same-sex marriage was several decades agoâitâs effectively only discussed as outdated jokes about Utah and Mormons, who banned the practice over 120 years ago. Yet the moral reasoning behind societyâs rejection of polygamy remains just as uncomfortable and legally weak as same-sex marriage opposition was until recently. Thatâs one reason why progressives who reject the case for legal polygamy often donât really appear to have their hearts in it. They seem uncomfortable voicing their objections, clearly unused to being in the position of rejecting the appeals of those who would codify non-traditional relationships in law. They are, without exception, accepting of the right of consenting adults to engage in whatever sexual and romantic relationships they choose, but oppose the formal, legal recognition of those relationships. Theyâre trapped, I suspect, in prior opposition that they voiced from a standpoint of political pragmatism in order to advance the cause of gay marriage. In doing so, they do real harm to real people. Marriage is not just a formal codification of informal relationships. Itâs also a defensive system designed to protect the interests of people whose material, economic and emotional security depends on the marriage in question. If my liberal friends recognize the legitimacy of free people who choose to form romantic partnerships with multiple partners, how can they deny them the right to the legal protections marriage affords? Polyamory is a fact . People are living in group relationships today. The question is not whether they will continue on in those relationships. The question is whether we will grant to them the same basic recognition we grant to other adults: that love makes marriage, and that the right to marry is exactly that, a right. Why the opposition, from those who have no interest in preserving âtraditional marriageâ or forbidding polyamorous relationships? I think the answer has to do with political momentum, with a kind of ad hoc-rejection of polygamy as necessary political concession. And in time, I think it will change. The marriage equality movement has been both the best and worst thing that could happen for legally sanctioned polygamy. The best, because that movement has required a sustained and effective assault on âtraditional marriageâ arguments that reflected no particular point of view other than that marriage should stay the same because itâs always been the same. In particular, the notion that procreation and child-rearing are the natural justification for marriage has been dealt a terminal injury. We donât, after all, ban marriage for those who canât conceive, or annul marriages that donât result in children, or make couples pinkie swear that theyâll have kids not too long after they get married. We have insisted instead that the institution exists to enshrine in law a special kind of long-term commitment, and to extend certain essential logistical and legal benefits to those who make that commitment. And rightly so. Politics By JONATHAN RAUCH Primary Source By ANDREW SULLIVAN The Big Idea By EMILY ESFAHANI SMITH But the marriage equality movement has been curiously hostile to polygamy, and for a particularly unsatisfying reason: short-term political need. Many conservative opponents of marriage equality have made the slippery slope argument, insisting that same-sex marriages would lead inevitably to further redefinition of what marriage is and means. See, for example, Rick Santorumâs infamous âman on dogâ comments, in which he equated the desire of two adult men or women to be married with bestiality. Polygamy has frequently been a part of these slippery slope arguments. Typical of such arguments, the reasons why marriage between more than two partners would be destructive were taken as a given. Many proponents of marriage equality, Iâm sorry to say, went along with this evidence-free indictment of polygamous matrimony. They choose to side-step the issue by insisting that gay marriage wouldnât lead to polygamy. That legally sanctioned polygamy was a fate worth fearing went without saying. To be clear: our lack of legal recognition of group marriages is not the fault of the marriage equality movement. Rather, itâs that the tactics of that movement have made getting to serious discussions of legalized polygamy harder. I say that while recognizing the unprecedented and necessary success of those tactics. I understand the political pragmatism in wanting to hold the lineâto not be perceived to be slipping down the slope. To advocate for polygamy during the marriage equality fight may have seemed to confirm the socially conservative narrative, that gay marriage augured a wholesale collapse in traditional values. But times have changed; while work remains to be done, the immediate danger to marriage equality has passed. In 2005, a denial of the right to group marriage stemming from political pragmatism made at least some sense. In 2015, after this ruling, it no longer does. While important legal and practical questions remain unresolved, with the Supreme Courtâs ruling and broad public support, marriage equality is here to stay. Soon, it will be time to turn the attention of social liberalism to the next horizon. Given that many of us have argued, to great effect, that deference to tradition is not a legitimate reason to restrict marriage rights to groups that want them, the next step seems clear. We should turn our efforts towards the legal recognition of marriages between more than two partners. Itâs time to legalize polygamy. *** Conventional arguments against polygamy fall apart with even a little examination. Appeals to traditional marriage, and the notion that child rearing is the only legitimate justification of legal marriage, have now, I hope, been exposed and discarded by all progressive people. Whatâs left is a series of jerry-rigged arguments that reflect no coherent moral vision of what marriage is for, and which frequently function as criticisms of traditional marriage as well. Many argue that polygamous marriages are typically sites of abuse, inequality in power and coercion. Some refer to sociological research showing a host of ills that are associated with polygamous family structures. These claims are both true and beside the point. Yes, itâs true that many polygamous marriages come from patriarchal systems, typically employing a âhub and spokesâ model where one husband has several wives who are not married to each other. These marriages are often of the husband-as-boss variety, and we have good reason to suspect that such models have higher rates of abuse, both physical and emotional, and coercion. But this is a classic case of blaming a social problem on its trappings rather than on its actual origins. After all, traditional marriages often foster abuse. Traditional marriages are frequently patriarchal. Traditional marriages often feature ugly gender and power dynamics. Indeed, many would argue that marriageâs origins stem from a desire to formalize patriarchal structures within the family in the first place. Weâve pursued marriage equality at the same time as weâve pursued more equitable, more feminist heterosexual marriages, out of a conviction that the franchise is worth improving, worth saving. If weâre going to ban marriages because some are sites of sexism and abuse, then weâd have to start with the old fashioned one-husband-and-one-wife model. If polygamy tends to be found within religious traditions that seem alien or regressive to the rest of us, that is a function of the very illegality that should be done away with. Legalize group marriage and you will find its connection with abuse disappears. Another common argument, and another unsatisfying one, is logistical. In this telling, polygamous marriages would strain the infrastructure of our legal systems of marriage, as they are not designed to handle marriage between more than two people. In particular, the claim is frequently made that the division of property upon divorce or death would be too complicated for polygamous marriages. I find this argument eerily reminiscent of similar efforts to dismiss same-sex marriage on practical grounds. (The forms say husband and wife! What do you want us to do, print new forms?) Logistics, it should go without saying, are insufficient reason to deny human beings human rights. If current legal structures and precedents arenât conducive to group marriage, then they will be built in time. The comparison to traditional marriage is again instructive. We have, after all, many decades of case law and legal organization dedicated to marriage, and yet divorce and family courts feature some of the most bitterly contested cases imaginable. Complication and dispute are byproducts of human relationships and human commitment. We could, as a civil society, create a legal expectation that those engaging in a group marriage create binding documents and contracts that clearly delineate questions of inheritance, alimony, and the like. Prenups are already a thing. Most dispiriting, and least convincing, are those arguments that simply reconstitute the slippery slope arguments that have been used for so long against same sex marriage. âIf we allow group marriage,â the thinking seems to go, âwhy wouldnât marriage with animals or children come next?â The difference is, of course, consent. In recent years, a progressive and enlightened movement has worked to insist that consent is the measure of all things in sexual and romantic practice: as long as all involved in any particular sexual or romantic relationship are consenting adults, everything is permissible; if any individual does not give free and informed consent, no sexual or romantic engagement can be condoned. This bedrock principle of mutually-informed consent explains exactly why we must permit polygamy and must oppose bestiality and child marriage. Animals are incapable of voicing consent; children are incapable of understanding what it means to consent. In contrast, consenting adults who all knowingly and willfully decide to enter into a joint marriage contract, free of coercion, should be permitted to do so, according to basic principles of personal liberty. The preeminence of the principle of consent is a just and pragmatic way to approach adult relationships in a world of multivariate and complex human desires. Progressives have always flattered themselves that time is on their side, that their preferences are in keeping with the arc of history. In the fight for marriage equality, this claim has been made again and again. Many have challenged our politicians and our people to ask themselves whether they can imagine a future in which opposition to marriage equality is seen as a principled stance. I think itâs time to turn the question back on them: given what you know about the advancement of human rights, are you sure your opposition to group marriage wonât sound as anachronistic as opposition to gay marriage sounds to you now? And since we have insisted that there is no legitimate way to oppose gay marriage and respect gay love, how can you oppose group marriage and respect group love? I suspect that many progressives would recognize, when pushed in this way, that the case against polygamy is incredibly flimsy, almost entirely lacking in rational basis and animated by purely irrational fears and prejudice. What weâre left with is an unsatisfying patchwork of unconvincing arguments and bad ideas, ones embraced for short-term convenience at long-term cost. We must insist that rights cannot be dismissed out of short-term interests of logistics and political pragmatism. The course then, is clear: to look beyond political convenience and conservative intransigence, and begin to make the case for extending legal marriage rights to more loving and committed adults. Itâs time. California By Jeremy B. White Updated 05/08/20 09:44 PM EDT By Sam Sutton and Carly Sitrin By Bill Mahoney and Josh Gerstein Updated 03/29/20 02:48 PM EDT © 2021  LLC",

        "articles": "Paul Ryan's comments came as new stories were breaking alleging that Donald Trump improperly touched four women in separate incidents. | AP Photo The speaker tells donors that the GOP nominee is doing worse than McCain in '08, when Republicans lost 21 seats. By ALEX ISENSTADT and JOHN BRESNAHAN 10/12/2016 11:51 PM EDT Speaker Paul Ryan told top donors on Wednesday evening that he’s growing concerned about whether House Republicans will be able to weather the political storm this November — and suggested the outcome for his party could be dire. During a conference call, Ryan said he believed that House Republicans had taken a serious hit amid Donald Trump’s freefall following release of the now-infamous \"Access Hollywood\" video, according to a person who was on the call. Ryan noted that Republicans lost more than 20 seats in 2008, when John McCain lost to Barack Obama by seven percentage points. By comparison, Ryan pointed out grimly, Trump is trailing by around 10 percent nationally. \"Speaker Ryan holds routine calls with top supporters, top grassroots organizers, and many others. This is an opportunity to discuss our efforts to win in November,\" said Zack Roday, a Ryan spokesman. Ryan's comments came as new stories were breaking in the New York Times, Palm Beach Post and Rolling Stone alleging that Trump improperly touched four women in separate incidents going back decades. The Trump campaign denied the allegations and has threatened to sue at least one of the publications, yet the controversy over Trump's sexual interactions with women — and his vulgar comments about them — has dominated the presidential race for the last five days, led to a collapse in his poll numbers, and threatens to sweep away the House and Senate GOP majorities. By RACHAEL BADE and HEATHER CAYGLE Trump is furious that Ryan told his House GOP colleagues in a Monday call that he will no longer defend the Republican presidential nominee or campaign with Trump. During that discussion, Ryan — who is still endorsing Trump — added that members should worry about their own races, not the presidential battle. Wednesday evening, according to the participant, Ryan sought to clarify his earlier remarks on Trump. Ryan told that he had never intended to pick a fight with Trump, but rather to simply highlight the need to maintain the party’s hold on the chamber. For his members to survive, Ryan said on the call, they would need Trump to do well in November. But Ryan also had tough words for Trump. The speaker said that the media was set on driving a wedge between Trump the congressional wing of the party, but that Trump — whom Ryan described as lacking political discipline — had failed to understand that dynamic. Ryan is aware that Trump's troubles have put the House in play. Democrats must net 30 seats in order to capture the majority, a tall order but one that’s become less unrealistic as Trump craters. Ryan also said on the call that he would be appearing with College Republicans on Friday, when he would be laying out a case against Hillary Clinton. Ryan was joined on the call by Spencer Zwick, his top fundraiser and a top ally of Mitt Romney. By CRISTIANO LIMA Trump has already launched into an all-out attack on Ryan on Twitter and in public rallies. In a campaign stop in Florida on Wednesday — before the latest sexual impropriety allegations emerged — Trump complained that Ryan never called him after Sunday's debate with Hillary Clinton. And Trump suggested Ryan is part of some \"sinister deal\" to undermine his bid for the White House, although he didn't offer specifics. \"There is a whole deal going on there,\" Trump said. \"There is a whole deal going on and we're going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But there's a whole sinister deal going on.\" While some GOP lawmakers have called Trump directly to ask him to lay off Ryan, the speaker has also faced a backlash from some of his own members who back Trump. Oklahoma GOP Rep. Jim Bridenstine tweeted on Wednesday that he wouldn't back Ryan for speaker. \"Given the stakes of this election, if Paul Ryan isn't for Trump, then I'm not for Paul Ryan,\" Bridenstine said. Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) has also complained about Ryan's position, saying it could backfire on the House GOP Conference. Long has called top Republicans to vent his displeasure with Ryan. \"If everyone backs away from our nominee for president, that's going to spell disaster down-ticket,\" Long told the Springfield News-Leader. \"No one's seen anything like this election before. It's a movement, and it's been a movement since a year ago August.\" Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for  Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox. © 2021  LLC",

By ANNIE KARNI and ANDREW RESTUCCIA 09/27/2018 01:58 PM EDT Updated 09/27/2018 09:12 PM EDT President Donald Trump and his aides were ebullient Thursday as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh defiantly rejected charges of sexual misconduct — a mood that reflected some relief after Trump officials conceded that his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, offered a compelling performance in the first half of the day. Trump and senior officials were impressed by Kavanaugh’s combative defense before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which the Trump nominee, alternating between fury and tears, called several misconduct charges against him a “calculated and orchestrated political hit” and “national disgrace” that had devastated his life and family. Minutes after the committee adjourned Thursday evening, Trump tweeted that his nominee \"showed America exactly why I nominated him.\" \"His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting,\" Trump wrote. \"Democrats' search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist.

That capped something of a roller-coaster day for a White House that had watched in the morning as Ford gave a powerful and disturbing account of what she said was a sexual assault by Kavanaugh when the two were high school students at a party in the 1980s. \"She seems sincere, kind, thoughtful and credible,\" a former Trump White House official said. \"Hard to suggest she is politically motivated.\" Trump, who watched the hearing aboard Air Force One on his flight back to Washington from New York City early in the day, refrained from tweeting until the day’s proceedings had ended shortly before 7:00 p.m. Some of his aides fretted early in the day as Trump watched CNN and Fox News commentary suggesting that Ford’s testimony — and what officials called a disappointing performance by a female prosecutor hired by Judiciary Committee Republicans to question her — might tip the balance against Kavanaugh’s troubled nomination. Kavanaugh said he did not share his fiery opening remarks with anyone except a law clerk, and a White House official said his defiant tone when he initially addressed the committee after lunch caught many in the building by surprise. But Trump was elated when Kavanaugh, whom he previously complained was not defending himself with enough force, lashed out at Democrats and the media for what Kavanaugh called casual character assassination. One senior White House official said Kavanaugh seemed to have tapped into a key element of Trump’s own personal style: hit back hard and without apology. “What do you like to drink, Senator?” Kavanaugh angrily asked one questioner, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). “I think he’s studied the way people around Donald Trump have been treated and he figured out a way to prevail,” said the official. The official confirmed that Trump had watched and relished Kavanaugh’s combative opening statement, which the official called “superb.” Some of Kavanaugh’s rhetoric also echoed comments of the president at a news conference the day earlier, in which Trump lambasted Democrats for allegedly manufacturing false allegations in what Trump called a “con job.” Both Trump and Kavanaugh also suggested that men accused of sexual misconduct had lost the presumption of innocence, and that higher principles of due process and public service were at stake. The senior White House official added that Kavanaugh’s approach also echoed the defiant response of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who survived public charges of sexual harassment that played out during his nationally televised 1991 confirmation hearings. It remained unclear by evening whether Kavanaugh’s nomination would survive an astonishing day that covered everything from alleged rape to drinking games, the geography of Bethesda, Maryland, and crass high school yearbook jokes. But the day’s end, the mood in the White House was considerably brighter than it had been earlier, when some officials cringed at the role of Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, who led the GOP side’s questioning of Ford. “That’s a disaster,” said one administration official. The official argued that Republican lawmakers had erred by caving to the pressures of identity politics and hiring a woman to quiz Ford to avoid having an all-white male lineup of Republicans question her. Trump allies also recognized the bad optics of a prosecutor seeming to interrogate a victim who even some committee Republicans later acknowledged had come across as sympathetic. Mitchell approached Ford with a patient tone, but seemed to be searching for holes in Ford’s story as she asked about her air travel — Ford has said the alleged assault left her claustrophobic and uncomfortable in airplanes — and who paid for and advised her to take a polygraph test. Trump allies who want to see Kavanaugh confirmed also were concerned that Mitchell failed to poke any substantial holes in Ford's account or character that would make her story less believable. During her questioning, Mitchell herself acknowledged that the day's format — in which she was able to question Ford in five-minute intervals — was not an ideal way to assess an alleged victim's story. But not all White House aides and officials were so unhappy about Ford’s testimony in the first half of the day. One White House official and another person close to the confirmation process noted that, despite emotional responses on TV and via social media to the day's hearing, the key audience is a limited number of Republican senators. They include Jeff Flake, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Those senators have expressed a desire for a no-drama, fair hearing, and the sources said they felt Mitchell was delivering that. The two sources also noted that the hearing had failed to produce any new facts that might incriminate Kavanaugh. And midway through the 53-year-old judge’s testimony, he had made no obvious stumbles or admissions of wrongdoing. Trump aides were “particularly impressed,” said one of the White House officials, when Kavanaugh told senators that his 10-year-old daughter had recently said at bedtime that she and her sister should pray for Ford. And after Sen. Lindsey Graham launched a dramatic tirade against committee Democrats who he said “want … to destroy this guy’s life,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cheered him on via Twitter. White House aides said they felt Graham had articulated their own anger over the personal charges against Kavanaugh, including Graham’s charge, delivered at a near-shout, that “What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020.” At least one conservative legal activist distributed talking points early in the day defending Mitchell and noting Ford conceded to her that she must have been given a ride to and from the party where she says Kavanaugh assaulted her but could not remember who might have done so. “Whoever drove [Ford] home doesn't exist,\" the activist argued. The talking points also noted that a polygraph test Ford took and passed could be invalid because it was administered around the time of her grandmother’s funeral. The talking points also noted that Mitchell had managed to prove that \"there was no witness to support what she's alleging happened.” At the day’s outset, Republicans expressed resignation that Kavanaugh had mishandled the situation from the beginning, by trying to portray himself as a choir boy instead of admitting that he drank heavily in high school, college and law school, as multiple classmates and yearbook entries have shown. A better strategy, White House officials conceded, would have been to admit he didn’t remember the assault described by Ford, but that he believed her story and issue her an apology. White House officials said they saw his decision to sit for an interview with Fox News on Monday as a mistake. And that a better way to have handled the accusations would have been as Trump did after the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in October 2016: a quick apology and then a forceful forging ahead. “He feels for Brett, the person,” one person familiar with Trump’s thinking said early in the day, noting that Trump sees it as Kavanaugh’s job to defend his own name. “When he’s accused, he punches back,” the person said. By the day’s end, Kavanaugh had done the same — winning the president’s support, even if his nomination remained in the balance. Christopher Cadelago contributed to this report.

Bruce Rauner’s political adversaries seized on the moment. | Brian Cassella/Getty Images By SHIA KAPOS and NATASHA KORECKI 07/23/2018 05:30 PM EDT CHICAGO — It isn’t easy to stun political insiders in a city with a rich history of corruption. Here, cash bribes are stuffed in brown paper bags, a long line of aldermen have gone to prison and a city council member was once famously caught on a wiretap proclaiming: “most aldermen, most politicians are hos.” But an incident at a Sunday church service involving the governor and a mayoral candidate may have just done it. Gov. Bruce Rauner, who’s campaigning as an anti-corruption crusader, today found himself fending off attacks on his own ethics after attending an event where a political ally handed out $300,000 in cash. The cash giveaway happened after the Republican governor spoke to a church on Chicago’s South Side on Sunday along with Willie Wilson, a onetime presidential candidate and 2019 challenger to Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Both Rauner and Wilson, political allies, addressed the congregation with the governor stating: “We’re honored to help you pay your property taxes. Happy to do it.” It was a reference, his campaign later explained, to Rauner’s work with Wilson’s private foundation. Wilson then stood inside the church holding stacks of cash and handed out bills to passersby. Wilson told  that the money was from his foundation — and that $100,000 of it came from Rauner himself.

While election experts indicated the governor was not in the legal peril — Rauner was not present as the cash was being dispensed -- the governor still faced an onslaught of criticism from adversaries on Monday. “It looks kind of skeevy,” said Ken Menzel, general counsel at the Illinois State Board of Elections, who noted he did not have enough information to make a call one way or another on the matter. “If that were the threshold for Illinois politics, the chambers would be empty.” Rauner stepped up his criticism of Wilson on Monday, saying he didn’t know of the plan to hand out cash at the event and condemned Wilson for doing so. News of the cash hand-outs from a candidate to potential voters harkened back to Chicago’s rich tradition of smoked-filled backroom deals, secret payoffs and a line of aldermen who’ve served prison time. “It’s always happened, it just depends on what scale, what magnitude … Situations close to this but smaller in scale were prevalent back in the day. Not to this magnitude and not to this openness, but yes, I’ve seen this before,” said Burt Odelson, an election attorney for 45 years. Odelson said while he wouldn’t declare a crime had been committed, it got close to the line. “Vote buying was put in the statute for a reason. The General Assembly didn’t want anyone influenced by direct cash money in their pocket.” Elections By CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO A Rauner campaign spokesman said the governor’s remarks referenced the work of Wilson’s foundation and were not a reference to giving out money. “Governor Rauner has supported the Willie Wilson Foundation to help people hurt by the rigged property tax system in Cook County. He was not aware that any cash was going to be handed out at the event,” campaign spokesman Alex Browning said Monday. “The governor respects Dr. Wilson’s philanthropic pursuits, but believes distributing cash is inappropriate for any candidate seeking public office.” On Sunday evening, Rauner’s team would only issue a statement regarding the governor’s attendance at the event. Rauner’s political adversaries seized on the moment. “So let me get this straight. @BruceRauner, the sitting governor of the state of Illinois went to church yesterday and watched as $100,000 of his own money was handed out in front of him,” J.B. Pritzker’s campaign manager, Anne Caprara said over Twitter. “A sitting governor who regularly rants against corruption in Springfield, but somehow thinks that handing out cash to voters after a campaign speech does not smack of corruption????” The Illinois Campaign for Political Reform, which monitors Illinois campaign activity, say there’s nothing outright illegal about Wilson giving out money to help people. “But there definitely are ethical questions that need to be asked,” said Eric Bradoch, a reporter and analyst for the non-partisan public interest group. “Is it right for a governor to go to an event where he knows charitable donations are being made and also at the same time promote himself as a candidate for governor?” Missing out on the latest scoops?

By KYLE CHENEY 02/20/2016 03:08 PM EST Updated 02/20/2016 06:55 PM EST Hillary Clinton delivers a speech following her win in the Nevada caucuses, Feb. 20, alongside her husband, former President Bill Clinton. | AP Photo Hillary Clinton scored a modest but decisive win in Saturday's Nevada caucuses, allaying for now fears about her erosion of support in national polls and injecting some momentum into the campaign as it heads toward arguably the most significant test of the 2016 Democratic primaries: South Carolina. The Associated Press called the race shortly after 5 p.m., and Clinton's lead over rival Bernie Sanders held at a little more than 4 percentage points with more than 80 percent of precincts reporting. The victory is a relief for Clinton loyalists, who feared getting clipped by Sanders and facing a week of stories about a stunning upset. “Some may have doubted us, but we never doubted each other,” Clinton said in her victory speech. “You turned out in every corner of this state with determination and purpose.” Clinton also took a swipe at Sanders, again presenting herself as a practical progressive who can actually get things done. “So Americans are right to be angry but we’re also hungry for real solutions,” she said. \"The truth is we aren't a single-issue country. We need more than a plan for the big banks. The middle class needs a raise and we need more jobs.\" And she rejected Sanders’ attack that she’s too cozy with Wall Street, saying eroding the power of special interests “starts by appointing a new justice to the Supreme Court who will protect the right of every citizen to vote, not every corporation to buy elections.” This was the win that eluded Clinton in Iowa, when she escaped with a minuscule lead in a contest largely considered a tie. And it followed her jaw-dropping defeat in New Hampshire last week, when Sanders clobbered her by more than 20 points. Nevada appeared to tighten after that contest, but Sanders was unable to close the deal, despite making inroads with Latino voters who could be a crucial bloc in future contests. In a nod to that dynamic, as results were coming in, Clinton tweeted, \"No podemos permitir que un republicano gane las elecciones,\" which translates to \"We cannot allow a Republican to win the election.\" Still, the win is a confidence boost for Clinton as she heads to South Carolina, where she's banking on dominance among the state's large African-American population to carry her to a solid victory. And she has good reason to think she'll maintain her strong hold on black voters. Entrance polls taken before Democratic voters entered the caucus sites on Saturday suggest Clinton’s win was powered by female and non-white voters – especially African Americans. Sanders and Clinton ran neck-and-neck among whites, who made up roughly three-in-five voters on Saturday. But Clinton won non-white voters by about 14 points, entrance polls show. That’s despite an apparent edge for Sanders among Hispanic voters, who comprised about half the non-white segment. But Clinton ran up huge margins among African-American voters, who are about a third of the non-white vote, 76 percent to 22 percent. Clinton won 57 percent of the female vote, according to the entrance polls, in addition to 44 percent of men. Sanders won 53 percent of the male vote, but he captured just 41 percent of women. Clinton's win kicked off a cascade of jubilant statements from the prominent groups that have endorsed her, from the Human Rights campaign to EMILY's List to Planned Parenthood Action Fund to the League of Conservation Voters. An excerpt Hillary Clinton's remarks in Nevada. Though polls had been spotty and unreliable here, most observers saw a tightening contest in the final weeks. The close call in the end will give Sanders' team hope that he can build on his support among minority voters. The race appears poised to stretch for months. In a letter to supporters, Sanders made clear that he viewed the Nevada results as a win of sorts. \"Nevada was supposed to be a state 'tailor made' for the Clinton campaign,\" he wrote. \"But today, we sent a message that will stun the political and financial establishment of this country: our campaign can win anywhere.\" In statement from his campaign, Sanders was more contrite. \"I just spoke to Secretary Clinton and congratulated her on her victory here in Nevada,\" he said. Notably, the statement overlooks South Carolina, as Sanders argues, \"we have the wind at our back as we head toward Super Tuesday\" — when about a dozen states cast ballots on March 1. In his concession speech, Sanders also minimized South Carolina. “I believe that on Super Tuesday we have got an excellent chance to win many of those states.” He added a bold prediction about the overall nominating contest, saying, “We are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States.” Republicans, rooting for a chaotic Democratic primary, jumped on the fact that Clinton's team had once projected a romp in Nevada. America Rising chairman Matt Rhoades called Clinton's victory \"another embarrassing setback\" in her quest for the nomination. In one possibly worrisome sign for Democrats heading into November, only 80,000 Nevadans turned out to caucus on Saturday — down from nearly 120,000 in 2008. Concern from Clinton about the tightening race defined the atmosphere of the day. \"The polls have tightened in part because Sanders has been able to raise more money than us,\" Clinton wrote in a fundraising solicitation to supporters on Saturday morning, a reflection of growing concerns that Sanders may have a cash edge in the next round of primary battles. The concern was on display Friday night too, when Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, took solace in a decision by the Culinary Workers Union to not take sides in the contest. While that choice deprived Clinton's already well-organized Nevada operation of a potent network of support, it was a better outcome than 2008. \"They were against us the last time. This is progress,\" he told a pool reporter. She maintained an urgent tone throughout Saturda. In her one public event of the day, Clinton strode into Harrah's employee cafeteria to cheers, alongside top aides Huma Abedin, videographer Julie Zuckerbrod, press secretary Nick Merrill and trip director Connolly Keigher. “I need your help this morning, in the showroom. 11 a.m.,\" she urged attendees. “I need your help. The showroom.” Asked by a pool reporter about her feelings on the caucus, Clinton said, “Great. It’s a great day.” Her visit came shortly after Sanders made his own pitch to the crowd of workers. Clinton and Sanders have been throwing sharper elbows at each other for weeks, each seeking to show that the other isn't as attuned to the issues that minority voters care about. Sanders on Thursday linked Clinton to her husband's passage of welfare reform at the end of his first term, which Sanders called \"absolutely disastrous for low-income people in general, and the African-American community in particular.\" His message about malfeasance by financial institutions has also caught on in a state plagued by foreclosures during the economic collapse of 2008.

By ELENA SCHNEIDER 12/15/2015 05:16 AM EST Former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat who once touted NRA support, has become a target for some Democrats. | AP Photo Liberals across the country are challenging fellow Democrats on guns in primaries, opening up divisions within the party on one of the most volatile issues of 2016. In the Ohio Senate primary, a young city councilman is attacking former Gov. Ted Strickland, a popular Democrat who once touted National Rifle Association support. In the Las Vegas suburbs, four Democrats are racing to see who is more anti-gun, including one candidate who renounced his NRA membership. In central Florida — a pro-gun area — a rising star in the Democratic Party is under scrutiny for votes like one that prevented companies from banning guns from their parking lots. The new wave of attention to this issue from the left, which has watched closely as Hillary Clinton embraced gun control from the bully pulpit of a presidential campaign, signals a strategic shift for Democrats in some parts of the country. The party once let its moderate members off the hook on gun-related votes, understanding that Democrats from swing districts needed to hew closer to the NRA’s positions in order to survive politically. Rep. Robin Kelly, a Chicago Democrat whose first race for Congress in 2013 focused on guns, credits the new power of the issue for her place in the House. “It helped that my opponents were ‘A’ rated by NRA,” Kelly said in an interview. “If we were all ‘F’ rated [by the NRA], maybe, who knows what would’ve happened.” “It’s now a wedge issue, not just between Democrats and Republicans, but between Democrats, over who can be the strongest on this issue,” said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, the grass-roots arm of an advocacy group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Everytown for Gun Safety. 2016 By ANNIE KARNI While Democratic voters are virtually all-in supporting stricter gun laws — 76 percent back such legislation, the latest CBS/New York Times poll found — candidates like Strickland built their records when the issue was less of a litmus test in the party. Now, with gun violence at the front of Democrats’ minds, old votes and positions are coming back to haunt candidates with records that once fit loosely within the Democratic Party. Strickland compiled an NRA-friendly voting record in the House of Representatives, and the group endorsed him for governor over Republican John Kasich in 2010. But Strickland’s position shifted after the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012. He has spoken in favor of the universal background check bill introduced soon after. “He would have voted for it in 2013,” said Jennifer Donohue, an Ohio Democratic Party spokeswoman. “He continues to support it today.” According to Strickland opponent P.G. Sittenfeld’s campaign, Strickland “has now experienced an election-year conversion on the subject of guns,” said Dale Butland, Sittenfeld's campaign spokesman. “Ohio Democrats will have to decide in March if that conversion is sincere or merely politically expedient.” A House candidate in Nevada, former state House Speaker John Oceguera, worked to build up his pro-gun credentials before a 2012 run for Congress. The Democrat is running again in 2016 but singing a different tune: Oceguera said he was “fairly pro-gun” in the past, but he thought “enough was enough” when Congress voted down a pair of gun-control measures a day after the San Bernardino attacks. Oceguera then renounced his NRA membership. Another candidate in a four-way primary, state Sen. Ruben Kihuen, recently wrote a letter urging his state legislative colleagues to ban people on the terrorism watch list from buying guns, a popular proposal that nevertheless failed in Congress recently. In central Florida, near where George Zimmerman fatally shot Trayvon Martin in 2012, two Democrats are already fighting over their gun-safety bona fides. State Sen. Darren Soto, long mentioned as a future Democratic star, earned an “A” rating from the NRA in 2012. His record in the state Legislature includes a controversial vote regarding leaving guns in workplace parking lots, a measure that was opposed by Disney and other major Florida corporations. One of Soto’s current opponents for Congress, former Alan Grayson aide Susannah Randolph, said Soto told constituents he would “vote like a strong Democrat,” but when he got to Tallahassee, “he got swept up into a go along, get along. … That’s not understanding the real world consequence of your vote, and that’s disturbing.” Soto’s campaign countered Randolph’s assertion, saying that he supports expanding background checks for gun sales and banning sales to those on the federal no-fly list. “I stand for common sense gun reform and hope to bring that common sense to Washington,” Soto said in a statement. The candidates who once got “A” ratings from the NRA might be the most exposed in today’s Democratic Party, but many more in the party have compiled records featuring a stray vote or two that could cause them trouble in a contested primary race. Examples include Emily Cain, a former state legislator running for Congress in northern Maine, who supported a bill allowing state employees to carry concealed weapons in vehicles on state property in 2012. Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, a one-time Republican now running for Congress as a Democrat, has renounced any number of former conservative positions — but he did sign the guns-in-parking-lots bill that Soto supported. And when federal judges ordered Illinois to do away with its concealed-carry ban in 2013, many Democrats voted for the new concealed-carry law replacing it, including state Sen. Michael Noland, now running for Congress. Candidates with checkered records on guns will still be able to explain their choices, but they’ll have to do it delicately, said Martha McKenna, a Democratic consultant, who compared the shift in public opinion to gay marriage. By ANNIE KARNI “I think candidates who carry ‘A’ ratings from the NRA into a race, but now have a more middle-of-the-road opinion on guns, are representative of where our country is,” McKenna said. “The country is changing. … Candidates have an opportunity to do that as well, if they handle it the right way.” “It depends on their overall record,” said one national Democratic strategist, granted anonymity to discuss primaries. “So if it’s one issue or one vote with a reasonable explanation, that’s one thing, but if it’s part of a larger pattern, of a conservative versus liberal voting record, then it’s a problem.” In recent elections, a new generation of gun-control groups has shown its willingness to spend money pressing this issue. In 2012, a super PAC funded by Bloomberg spent millions of dollars to defeat a gun-rights supporter, Rep. Joe Baca, in a Democrat-versus-Democrat race. Everytown for Gun Safety spent $2.2 million this fall on ads backing two Democratic state Senate candidates in Virginia, though the group has not yet settled on a strategy for the fall. \"We're watching what candidates are saying on guns and we'll decide whether or not it makes sense to engage in the primary or for the general,” said Erika Soto Lamb, communications director of Everytown for Gun Safety. Americans for Responsible Solutions, the advocacy group founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, spent about $10 million on ballot initiatives and House and Senate races in 2014, and ARS will play again in 2016. “We’re evaluating a number of races at all levels,” said Mark Prentice, the group’s communications director.

        "articles": "“Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed,” John Podesta said. | AP Photo By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI and KYLE CHENEY 12/12/2016 12:49 PM EST Updated 12/12/2016 01:13 PM EST Hillary Clinton’s top political adviser John Podesta said the campaign is supporting an effort by members of the Electoral College to request an intelligence briefing on foreign intervention in the presidential election. “The bipartisan electors' letter raises very grave issues involving our national security,” Podesta said in a statement Monday. “Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed.” “Each day that month, our campaign decried the interference of Russia in our campaign and its evident goal of hurting our campaign to aid Donald Trump,” he said. “Despite our protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign. We now know that the CIA has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American.” Podesta's statement is the first public statement from the Clinton campaign raising questions about the legitimacy of Donald Trump's victory. It follows an open letter from 10 presidential electors — including Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi’s daughter Christine — requesting an intelligence briefing ahead of the Dec. 19 vote of the Electoral College. Shortly after Podesta's statement, the Democratic National Committee disseminated a  story that revealed the electors' call for a briefing. Two Democratic members of Congress have also suggested the Electoral College should take an active role in reassessing — or stopping — a Trump presidency. One of them, Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told  on Monday that Trump is a \"potentially dangerous president.\" \"It became clear to me last night that this man is not only unqualified to be president, he’s a danger to the republic,\" Himes said. \"I do think the Electoral College should choose someone other than Donald Trump to be president. That will lead to a fascinating legal issue ... but I would rather have a legal problem — a constitutional legal problem -- then to find out the White House was now the Kremlin’s chief ally.\" Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Ross D. Franklin/AP Photo Law And Order Trump's pardon didn't just let off a campaign ally. It endorsed a growing push to exempt sheriffs from any federal authority. By ROBERT L. TSAI September 01, 2017 Robert L. Tsai is Professor of Law at American University and author of Americaâs Forgotten Constitutions: Defiant Visions of Power and Community (Harvard 2014). When President Donald Trump pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio, calling him a âpatriot,â he didnât just absolve him from the consequences of defying a federal judge. He didnât merely excuse Arpaioâs racial profiling and illegal immigration sweeps. Trumpâs pardon did do all of that. But it also did something more: It boosted a radical theory of law and American history that Arpaio supports, and which is gaining steam across the United States. Itâs called the âconstitutional sheriffâ movement, and as it grows, itâs increasing the risk of conflict between local law enforcement and federal authorities. Its animating idea is that a sheriff holds ultimate law-enforcement authority in his countyâoutranking even the federal government within its borders. Though the movement claims deep history in English law, its real roots lie in the more recent fringes of American right-wing thought. And its popularity helps explain why Arpaioâs defiance of federal law shouldnât be seen as just one grandstanding sheriff crossing a line, but instead should be seen as part of a broader grassroots resistance to constitutional and cultural upheavals during the 20th century. The strange idea that unites all members of this movement is that a sheriff is the highest law enforcement officer within a countyâs bordersâsuperior not only to local police, but also to officers and agents of the federal government. The actual influence of sheriff supremacy is hard to measure, but it has been growing in recent years, and today the official constitutional sheriffsâ association boasts 4,500 dues paying members and over 200 sheriffs. Its highest-profile members include Arpaio and David Clarke, who just resigned as sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, reportedly to help Trump in some capacity. But those figures may underestimate how far its influence extends, and how fully it pervades certain regions of the country. In 2013, Arpaio joined nearly 500 other sheriffs who vowed not to obey any federal law that required them to confiscate guns from private citizens. In Utah, 28 of 30 sheriffs went even further, warning that â[n]o federal official will be permitted to descend upon our constituents and take from them what the Bill of Rightsâin particular Amendment IIâhas given them.â The constitutional sheriff movement arose from the ashes of the far-right, anti-semitic Posse Comitatus movement of the 1970s and 80s, led by William Potter Gale. The insignia favored by these Christian Patriots was a redesigned sheriffâs badge containing a noose, Bible and sword, to reflect their belief that sheriffs were responsible for the armed defense of citizens and higher law (a combination of their view of the Constitution and Christian Identity teachings). Before the movement collapsed with Galeâs death, its paramilitary figures developed an anti-tax, anti-government agenda that stoked conspiracy theories that Jews were responsible for oppressing farmers through crushing taxes and exorbitant loans. Its foot soldiers gained notoriety when they tried to stop foreclosures in the Midwest and engaged in shootouts with U.S. marshals. The modern constitutional sheriff movement has revived the idea of sheriff supremacy envisioned by the Christian Patriots, tried to shed its anti-Semitic and racist origins, and now seeks to âtake back America county by county, state by state.â Today, its ideology has gained traction with the militia movement, so-called sovereign citizens, separatists wary of centralized governmentâand increasingly, landowners, county commissioners, veterans and law enforcement figures. Cliven Bundy, who has clashed for years with the Bureau of Land Management, is an adherent of sheriff supremacy. In 2014, he demanded that the local sheriff step in and protect him from federal agents: âSheriff, this is what We the People are asking this morning. Disarm the Park Service at â¦parks where the federal government claims they have jurisdiction.â One of his sons, Ryan Bundy, later said on TV, âThe county sheriff is the only person that We the People have allowed to have policing power.â As these unorthodox ideas have spread, politicians and lawmen have played boldly to anti-government sentiment, especially fears of federal officials intruding on property rights and gun rights. In 2014, Lora Hubbel, a candidate to become governor of South Dakota, told an audience: âThe sheriff is the highest law officer in the countyâ¦.Your county sheriff can tell the federal government âNo, you canât cross into my county.â Your local sheriff is your best protection against the federal government.â A number of candidates for sheriff or county commissioner around the country have campaigned explicitly on county-first theories of legal power. In New Hampshire, a businessman named Frank Szabo vowed to serve Hillsborough County as a constitutional sheriff who would defend citizens from ârogue federal and state agencies.â He even said he would be open to using deadly force to stop an abortion. And during the tense standoff in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge between Ammon Bundyâs armed men and federal agents, Glenn Palmer, a constitutional sheriff in Grant County, Oregon, praised the occupiers as âpatriots.â Some, like Szabo and Hubbel, have lost elections when constituents recoil from the practical consequences of sheriff supremacy; others, like Arpaio, have been rewarded for their militancy. Michael Barkun, an expert on political extremism, has termed this philosophy âradical localism,â because it valorizes and exploits subnational sources of power. In theory, that kind of localism could be a vehicle for many kinds of politics, but in practice constitutional sheriffs and their followers tend to occupy the edges of anti-government conservatism, organizing themselves to promote gun rights and property rights, to resist tax laws, national healthcare, gay marriageâand in Arpaioâs case, to implement a muscular view of border security. The enforcement policies of constitutional sheriffs arenât neutral, but instead reflect a traditionalist and often apocalyptic worldview. Do they have a point, at least in principle? The Constitutional Sheriffs claim to be supported by long tradition, but in fact sheriff supremacy is based on a faulty reading of history. Where statesâ rights has some support in the text and history of the Constitution (notably in the 10th Amendment, but limited by the Reconstruction Amendments), the idea of sheriff supremacy does not: It has been made up by stitching together random references to sheriffs and militias in our political and legal texts. It relies on a highly selective reading of history, pretending that the high sheriff of the English shire was transplanted to colonial America, and then somehow emerged in the present day untouched by legal developments over the past 200 years. In fact, in colonial America, most sheriffs were appointed by the Crown or landowners rather than elected by the people. The turn toward direct election of sheriffs came later, as part of the reforms of Jacksonian democracy. The militant orientation of the modern movement also comes from elevating the right to bear arms above all other rights, while treating the Second Amendment as if it codified the militia as a constitutional entity on par with Congress, the president, or the Supreme Court. It didnât do thatânot even close. And the sheriff supremacists never mention the 14th Amendment, which guaranteed equality and due process as part of the rights of national citizenship, and imposed new limits on states (and, by extension, local authorities). Despite the âconstitutionalâ label, sheriff supremacy makes mincemeat out of the framersâ constitutional design. The most basic principle of the original American Constitution is that of federal supremacy: When an irreconcilable conflict emerges between federal law and a subordinate source of law, federal law prevails. The office of sheriff itself is a creature of state constitutions and state law rather than some unchanging âcommon lawâ that supersedes federal law. Under long-standing constitutional principles, the federal governmentâs power to implement national policy reaches wherever is necessary to make that policy effective, as long as it doesnât contravene a specific power that has been reserved for the states. Nowhere did the framers explicitly authorize local government officials and lawmen to act as final authorities on the Constitutionâs meaning. That would have run counter to every impulse they had in creating a stronger, more effective national government, and a coherent and consistent rule of law. The very thought of hundreds or thousands of armed individuals (there are over 3,000 sheriffs nationwide) each claiming the last word on the Constitution would have sent shudders through the men who met in Philadelphia. The ideology of sheriff supremacy has attracted supporters largely by trading on popular suspicion of the federal government and disgust with land management policies. And, not surprisingly, the belief system has ended up encouraging clashes between sheriffs and the laws of their own state. In March 2013, Nick Finch, the sheriff of Liberty County, Florida, refused to enforce a state law that banned carrying a concealed weapon without a license. The sheriffâs reason for releasing the man from jail and allegedly altering the arrest records: âI know what law rules the day, and itâs the U.S. Constitution.â When word got out, Governor Rick Scott suspended Finch and the state charged him with official misconduct. Finch was eventually reinstated after a jury refused to convict. During trial, Finchâs lawyer had invited the jury to engage in nullification: âThere ainât many of yâall, but you have your own common code or beliefs ... Itâs a way of life over here for people to own guns ... Thereâs a distinct possibility that, every now and then, one of yâall is going to make a mistake and he doesnât want to create a convicted felon out of an incident that could be misunderstood.â The costs of friction caused by sheriff supremacy can be high, and they always end up falling squarely on a sheriffâs constituents. Though a sheriff might sweep into office by promising to protect local taxpayers, overly aggressive tactics can backfire by leading to expensive lawsuits. One estimate put Maricopa County taxpayers on the hook for over $70 million dollars to defend Arpaioâs policies. The face of the constitutional sheriff movement today is Richard Mack, who like Arpaio was once a sheriff in Arizona. Mack is the author of the pamphlet, Constitutional Sheriff: Americaâs Last Hope, which Arpaio has urged every citizen, police officer and sheriff to read (the entire back cover, in fact, is taken up with a plug by Arpaio.) In his pamphlet, Mack urges lawmen to save America from âa growing Marxist creed ... political whining for universal health care, gun control, forced equality through governmental redistribution of wealth, and the removal of religious beliefs and expressions from our public institutions.â The county sheriff, according to Mack, âis our nationâs last line of defenseâ against these changes. But âthe greatest threat we face, as a nation,â he says, âis our own Federal Government.â In 2011, Mack, with the help of Arpaio and others, founded the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. âWeâre not mainstream,â Mack has confessed. CSPOA believes that âAmerica needs to make a strong turn around to get back on the freedom track laid for us by our Foundersâ and that the county sheriff âis the last hope of making this happen.â The organization advocates âprotection, service, and interpositionâ by sheriffs to protect citizenâs rights, and trains sheriffs and deputies how to engage in alternative tactics to resist the federal government. If that word âinterpositionâ sounds familiar, itâs because the concept was made famous in the 1950s when state officials tried to prevent racial integration by interposing themselves between white citizens and federal troops sent to enforce orders by federal judges. Itâs also closely related to the older idea of nullifying laws believed to be unconstitutionalâagain, popularized by slave states such as South Carolina that opposed any regulation of that practice. Ironically, the militant abolitionist John Brownâhated during his day by law enforcementâwas sometimes described by supporters as interposing himself and his men between the bodies of defenseless slaves and their owners, slave catchers, and the Slave Power that had corrupted the federal government. For todayâs constitutional sheriffs, interposition means demanding that federal agents obtain permission from a sheriff before conducting business in a county, and perhaps barring their way if consent is not given. It means stepping in between the government and county residents âto keep those at bay who would confiscate bank accounts, guns, land, property, and children.â It might also mean ignoring what âthe County Attorney advises the sheriff to doâ because they believe a sheriff âhas no obligation to go along with those who subvert the Constitution.â *** While in office, Arpaio behaved like what you would expect of someone who subscribed to sheriff supremacy. He consistently referred to himself as a âconstitutional sheriff.â His office regularly issued news releases asking for more armed volunteers for his Maricopa County posse, which is understood to be a representation of the people and the measure of a sheriffâs potency to resist tyranny. The bigger a sheriffâs militia, the more faith residents have that external threats can be resisted. In fact, Arpaio bragged that his office operated 52 separate posse groups with nearly 400 armed volunteers. He used posses to patrol shopping malls and even called for armed citizens to âtake actionâ against mass shooters and terrorists. In 2012, CSPOA gave Arpaio a lifetime achievement award. Whenever Arpaio wanted to strike a defiant tone, as he did once federal judges and the Department of Justice had had enough, he always returned to the provocative idea of sheriff supremacy. After a federal judge ruled that Arpaio lacked authority under state law or federal law to detain undocumented migrants, he simply flouted judicial orders and ignored his attorneyâs advice because he disagreed with the judgeâs interpretation of the Constitution. âI will continue to enforce illegal immigration laws,â he brazenly announced. Arpaio declared that he would ânever give in to control by the federal governmentâ and would not âback down.â He even came up with a secret backup plan to turn over captured migrants to Border Patrol instead of ICE to evade a judgeâs orders to cease and desist immigration enforcement. Trumpâs pardon of Arpaio didnât just let the sheriff off the hook; it short-circuited the part of the American judicial process designed to hold government accountable, and resolve conflicts between levels of government. It began when a class-action lawsuit was filed in 2007 by individuals who claimed they had been racially profiled during Arpaioâs immigration raids and traffic stops. In 2012, the DOJ intervened in the case to vindicate federal interests in ending discriminatory policing, to stop Arpaio from retaliating against his critics in violation of the First Amendment, and to ensure that non-English detainees didnât forfeit their rights without understanding them. Arpaio lost the first case and settled with DOJ, but was held in civil contempt of court for continuing to capture migrants without legal authority and for failing to turn over records of these encounters. Acting on a referral from the federal judge overseeing the case, the DOJ eventually sought to hold Arpaio accountable for criminal contempt after Arpaioâs recalcitrance continued. A second judge tried the case and convicted Arpaio, finding that he had âwillfully violated the [earlier] order by failing to do anything to ensure his subordinates' compliance and by directing them to continue to detain persons for whom no criminal charges could be filed.â Trump pardoned Arpaio just days before he was to be sentenced. During the legal proceedings, Arpaio made the puzzling assertion that he had never violated his oath of office, despite having ignored direct orders from a federal judge. As far as he was concerned, the oath of office gave him the right, indeed even the responsibility, to ignore the federal court. He was merely doing the rightful job of a sheriff, enforcing the laws and Constitution as he saw them, unaccountable to anyone but himself. Now that Arpaio has been pardoned, his place in the pantheon of constitutional sheriffs is secure. And his view of American law and historyâone shared by kindred spirits, and one that menaces not just federal law but the Constitution itselfâjust got a troubling endorsement from the president of the United States.

        "articles": "John Shinkle/ By NICK GASS 11/12/2015 07:05 AM EST Bernie Sanders snagged a major union endorsement on Thursday, with the American Postal Workers' Union announcing its backing of the Democratic presidential candidate. Sanders' largest union pickup comes as his chief rival, Hillary Clinton, has earned several significant labor endorsements in recent weeks. \"We should judge candidates not by their political party, not by what they say, not by what we think they stand for, but by what they do,” union President Mark Dimondstein said in the announcement backing the independent Vermont senator. \"Applying that criteria, Sen. Bernie Sanders stands above all others as a true champion of postal workers and other workers throughout the country.\" Dimondstein also pointed to Sanders' advocacy of a $15 minimum wage, free public college tuition and veterans' benefits. \"No other candidate has his record of fighting to defend and expand Social Security, promoting ‘Medicare for all,’ and opposing ‘fast track trade authority’ and rotten deals like the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP),\" the union president added. In the release announcing the endorsement, the union also makes reference to Sanders' speech to a union conference in Las Vegas in October. “He is a fierce advocate of postal reform to address the cause of the USPS financial crisis, an outspoken opponent of USPS policy that degrades mail service. He fought the close of post offices and spearheaded the effort to pass a ‘sense of the Senate’ resolution to restore service standards, which was approved by a vote of 85-11,” Dimondstein said. \"Bernie Sanders doesn't just talk the talk. He walks the walk. He is a leader in the fight to protect our public Postal Service.\" Clinton, meanwhile, last month earned the backing of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest trade union in the United States, boasting more than 1.6 million members. APWU is the second AFL-CIO member union to support Sanders, following the National Nurses Union in August. The endorsement comes on the same day Clinton maintained a strong lead nationally in a new CBS News/New York Times poll, drawing 52 percent to Sanders' 33 percent. In the same poll in October, Clinton had 56 percent, while Sanders had 32 percent. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley earned 5 percent. The survey was conducted Nov. 6-10 via landlines and cellphones, surveying 418 Democrats nationwide with a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "President Barack Obama spoke from the Oval Office for the third time during his presidency on Sunday evening. The president tells Americans that terrorism has evolved since 9/11 but it can be beaten if the country stays united. By SARAH WHEATON 12/06/2015 08:08 PM EST Updated 12/06/2015 10:08 PM EST President Barack Obama urged Americans to stay calm and vigilant, using a rare Oval Office address Sunday night to reassure the nation that his approach to fighting Islamic extremism is working both at home and abroad. In the wake of deadly attacks in Paris and California, Obama offered no new strategy for eliminating terror threats from ISIL and those the group inspires. Instead, he presented a broad survey of counter-terror tactics put in place since 9/11 and reviewed his administration’s multifaceted approach to managing the chaos in Iraq and Syria that has allowed ISIL to thrive. In recent years, extremist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIL have shifted their focus, he said, from complicated attacks on symbolic targets to simple shooting rampages in public spaces. “I know that after so much war, many Americans are asking whether we are confronted by a cancer that has no immediate cure,” Obama said. \"Well, here’s what I want you to know: The threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it.” He also called on mainstream Muslims, in unusually pointed terms, to help root out radicalism in their midst. And repeatedly, Obama urged all Americans to make decisions based on reason, not fear. “Our success won’t depend on tough talk, or abandoning our values, or giving into fear. That’s what groups like ISIL are hoping for,” Obama said, standing at a podium set up in front of his desk with red-draped windows as a backdrop. \"Instead, we will prevail by being strong and smart, resilient and relentless, and by drawing upon every aspect of American power.\" He insisted that the threats come from those following a \"perverted\" brand of Islam and insisted \"Muslim-Americans are our friends and neighbors\" and important allies in the fight against extremism. \"We cannot turn against one another,'' he said. At the same time, Obama -- who has faced criticism from Republicans who say he should speak more specifically about \"Islamic\" terrorism -- said Muslims have a responsibility to tackle extremism in their ranks. There's no \"denying the fact that an extremist ideology has spread within some Muslim communities. That’s a real problem that Muslims must confront without excuse,\" Obama said. \"Muslim leaders here and around the globe have to continue working with us to decisively and unequivocally reject the hateful ideology that groups like ISIL and Al Qaeda promote; to speak out against not just acts of violence, but also those interpretations of Islam that are incompatible with the values of religious tolerance, mutual respect, and human dignity.\" While the venue for the speech was rare — it was only the third time Obama made a primetime address from the Oval Office — his message was the same he has used for the last several weeks: He called on Americans not to reject their values by demonizing Muslims and refugees using words that echoed his remarks after an ISIL-organized shooting in Paris left 129 dead. He exhorted Congress to pass more gun restrictions after an apparently radicalized couple, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people last week in San Bernardino, pleas that echoed so many other speeches after mass shootings. And he insisted that sending large numbers of American troops to fight on the ground in Iraq or Syria would be a disastrous mistake, an assertion familiar to anyone who was watching his first campaign for president. By NAHAL TOOSI In fact, the last time Obama gave a prime time address from the Oval Office, he was making good on that early campaign promise, announcing the end of the American combat operation in Iraq in August of 2010. The setting seemed like a symbolic book end: as Obama noted, former President George W. Bush was sitting at the same desk seven and a half years earlier when he announced the start of the war. But it turns out ending that war didn’t end America’s involvement in the region, or all the threats of terror, as Obama tried to explain on Sunday night. The nature of the conflict is different: it’s more complicated, for one thing, and it’s not likely to come to a speedy close, he said. Nor will it be solved by sending in U.S. troops, as several 2016 presidential candidates have urged. Obama has consistently derided such \"tough talk\" coming from the campaign trail, which has only intensified in recent days, particularly after the San Bernardino shootings. For instance, in an interview with Fox News shortly after the speech, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio called for a \"substantial ground army\" saying, \"You can't just defeat them from an air perspective.\" Obama also called, as he repeatedly, for Congress to formally authorize the use of force against terrorists in the region. The president is still struggling to show the American public that he is taking the ISIL threat seriously after saying the group was \"contained\" just days before the Paris attacks. On Sunday, Obama pointed to various ways his administration is stepping up its efforts against ISIL. In recent weeks, officials announced moves to tighten a waiver program that lets Europeans visit the United States without a visa, and talks are underway in Vienna with the goal of ousting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad through a political process, a key to ultimately overpowering ISIL and stabilizing the region. Obama praised America’s allies for stepping up their efforts. After Paris, administration officials repeatedly insisted that there were no credible threats of an ISIL attack in the United States. And that’s still true, they say. But when reports that Malik had pledged allegiance to ISIL on Facebook shortly before opening fire on a holiday party at the Inland Regional Center, officials rushed to clarify that they hadn’t ruled out lone wolf-style attacks motivated by ISIL’s social media campaigns or Al Qaeda’s online magazine, Inspire. “The terrorist threat has evolved into a new phase” in recent years, Obama said, citing attacks on military personnel at Fort Hood in Texas in 2010 and in Chattanooga earlier this year as other examples of independent, small-scale attacks. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) agreed with Obama's assessment of an evolving terror threat, but not the president's response. \"That will require the president to produce a comprehensive strategy to confront and defeat ISIS. The enemy is adapting, and we must too,\" Ryan said in a statement. \"That’s why what we heard tonight was so disappointing: no new plan, just a half-hearted attempt to defend and distract from a failing policy.\" The Obama administration’s bid to short-circuit radicalization at home had come under fire even before the San Bernardino shooting, with independent investigators reportedly panning the State Department’s social media counterprogramming effort. Obama repeated his call to the nation’s Muslims to help authorities catch extremists before they act even as the federal authorities have alienated those communities with invasive tactics, including in Southern California. The White House had to send out a corrected transcript because Obama misspoke when he said he'd ordered his administration \"to review the visa waiver program under which the female terrorist in San Bernardino originally came to this country.\" In fact, Malik had a K-1 \"fiancé visa.\" A senior administration official said that Obama had decided to give the speech on Friday, and he was still putting the finishing touches on it as he wrapped up a White House reception for the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony. “We felt that the Oval Office was a familiar and appropriate venue” to illustrate the seriousness of the situation, the official said, adding that Obama would be speaking “from the place where he makes his decisions.” After the attacks not only in Paris and San Bernardino, but also in Beirut and in a Russian passenger jet over Egypt, the official said, “we recognized that there are very real and legitimate fears in the United States and around the world.” In France, those fears appear to be playing out in the political sphere: The Front National, a right-wing, nationalist party, made big gains in regional elections on Sunday.

        "articles": "Getty What Works City leaders want stronger regulations and curbs on firearms,  Magazine survey finds. By BEN WOFFORD October 26, 2015 Ben Wofford is a researcher at  Magazine.Â Ben Wofford is a researcher at  Magazine.Â The mayors of Americaâs cities are deeply concerned about rising crime and homicide ratesâand deeply frustrated with the Congressâ continued inaction on gun control amid a spate of mass shootings. Stronger gun regulation is needed right now, mayors say, and Congress has hung them out to dry. Senators and representatives âwill not be able to escape responsibility for the deaths of innocent Americans,â said Mayor Stephanie Miner of Syracuse, New York. âFailure to address an issue that amounts to slow-motion mass murder of American citizens, many of whom are black and brown, is political cowardice. Stand up! Do the right thing,â said Mayor Sly James of Kansas City, Missouri. Chula Vista Mayor Mary Salas said she had a simple message for Congress: âGet a backboneâdo your job.â Those answers were part of an exclusive  Magazine survey, which also found that more than 90 percent of mayors say that Congress is doing too little on issues of firearm regulation and gun violence. As Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee, a city that has seen a surging homicide rate this year, implored: âStand up against the fear-mongering NRA.â That emotion was seconded by Grand Rapids, Michigan, Mayor George Heartwell, who said, âBuck up and stand up to the NRA. Listen to the voice of the people of America.â The mayor of Stamford, Connecticut, was even more blunt to Congress: âJust do it.â The answers come from  Magazineâs third installment of an ongoing national Mayorsâ Survey, part of the award-winning What Works series. The survey garnered responses from 45 mayors across the country, from Las Vegas to Tallahassee, Houston to San Francisco, Phoenix to Chattanooga, Grand Rapids to Portland, Maine. While not scientific (the large majority of respondents, 85 percent, were Democrats, joined by four independents and three Republicans), the survey represents an array of cities about as diverse as size, politics and geography can allow, including states of every hueâred, blue and purple. Nearly across the board, the urban and suburban mayorsâwhere the vast preponderance of the nationâs crime and gun violence occursâwere disturbed by rising homicide trends; 91 percent of the mayors said they were either âdeeply concernedâ or âconcernedâ about crime and homicide trends in their city. One in four of the mayors surveyed said their city had suffered a âmass shootingâ incident since they came into officeâand those mayors were substantially more likely to say they were âdeeply concernedâ about crime and shootings. âWe are losing an entire American generation to this endless cycle of violence,â said Mayor Mitch Landreiu of New Orleans. âItâs a direct threat to our national well-being and security.â âThe time to act is now,â Richmond, Virginia, Mayor Dwight Jones said. âWe cannot wait to continue to allow illegals guns to subvert our neighborhoods and communities.â Such fears now lie at the heart of an inflamed national debate over the proper role of government in regulating guns. Twenty years ago, it was the federal government that took the lead in creating such policy, passing landmark legislation such as the so-called Brady Bill and the federal Assault Weapons Ban of the 1990s. Cities followed suit, passing longstanding handgun bans like those in Washington, D.C., and Chicago. But a changing national moodâaccompanied by the astonishing rise and power of groups like the National Rifle Associationâhave brought a new era of deregulation as the assault weapons ban expired, handgun bans were struck down by the Supreme Court and a raft of state legislatures passed controversial âopen carryâ and âstand your groundâ laws. A simultaneous rise in the number and severity of mass shootingsâVirginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Aurora and, most recently, Roseburg, Oregonâhas become a rallying cry for new gun violence coalitions like Mayors Against Illegal Guns, largely underwritten by billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Similarly, the mayors strongly backed President Barack Obamaâs push for congressional action on gun control, believing that more gun regulation, rather than less, was the answer to the crime and shootings. They resoundingly opposed, by roughly a 9-1 margin, both âopen carryâ proposals and the idea of arming teachers or principals as a way to increase school security. Washington inaction is one reason that more than 90 percent of the mayors surveyed said they believe cities and municipalities should be able to implement their own tougher gun restrictions than exist in their home states or by the federal government. They said that at the federal, state or local level, they overwhelmingly support a wide variety of gun control measuresâinclude expanded/stricter background checks (90 percent); closing the so-called âgun show loopholeâ (86 percent); expanding gun-buying restrictions to prohibit people subject to restraining orders (78 percent); closing a federal loophole that allows gun sales to proceed unless the FBI background check is completed within three days (78 percent); renewing the federal assault weapons ban (80 percent); and stiffening penalties for âstraw purchasesâ (73 percent). âCongress should act to protect the vast majority of residents by enacting sensible gun control measures,â Long Beach, California, Mayor Robert Garcia said. âThere is no question that easy access to guns makes all of us less safe.â I attended a gun buy-back program hosted by the police at a local church,â wrote Mayor Megan Barry of Nashville, Tennessee, who later implored Congress to act. âAcross the street, there were individuals standing on the sidewalk offering to purchase the guns before they were brought in.â Just nine percent of the mayors surveyed said they supported no further gun control, with Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mayor Dewey Bartlett Jr. saying that he â[honors] the Constitutional right of a U.S. citizen to bear arms.â More typical, though, were responses like that from Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who said she believes the Second Amendment clearly allows for some gun laws. As she put it, ââA well ordered militia surely means that reasonable controls on who can buy and/or own a gun are constitutional. Local officials are the ones best able to determine when and where concealed handguns should be carried.â Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said, âHawaii has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the entire nation, for one simple reason: We have strict gun laws. I strongly support the rights of law abiding citizens to own guns, but no one in Hawaii gets a gun license without a strict background check at the police department. We also benefit from the fact that itâs impossible to drive an illegal gun here from another state.â Absent a real commitment from Congressâwhich mayor after mayor said was clearly lackingâitâs no surprise that the residents of the nationâs cities were increasingly fearful of crime and shootings. As Dayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley said, âThis country is doing nothing and then elected congressmen have the audacity to seem surprised when we have a now near weekly devastation in our cities and unnecessary loss of life. We should not be surprised by this ending because our legislators choose to take no action.â Hartford, Connecticut, Mayor Pedro Segarra had an even simpler message for Congress: âGet to work.â â researcher Jesse Rifkin contributed reporting to this article.

By KELSEY SUTTON and PETER STERNE 05/27/2016 12:34 AM EDT Former CEO Cindy Jeffers. | Salon A Facebook page dedicated to celebrating the 20th anniversary of digital media pioneer Salon is functioning as a crowdsourced eulogy. Dozens of Salon alumni have, over the past several months, posted their favorite stories from and memories of the once-beloved liberal news site described as a âleft-coast, interactive version of The New Yorker,â a progressive powerhouse that over the years has covered politics with a refreshing aggressiveness, in a context that left plenty of room for provocative personal essays and award-winning literary criticism. Story Continued Below âWe were inmates who took over the journalistic asylum,â David Talbot, who founded the site in 1995, wrote on the Facebook page. âAnd we let it rip â we helped create online journalism, making it up as we went along. And we let nobody â investors, advertisers, the jealous media establishment, mad bombers, etc â get in our way.â They are mourning a publication they barely recognize today. âSadly, Salon doesnât really exist anymore,â wrote Laura Miller, one of Salonâs founding editors who left the site for Slate last fall. âThe name is still being used, but the real Salon is gone.â Salon, which Talbot originally conceived of as a âsmart tabloid,â began as a liberal online magazine and was quickly seen as an embodiment of the mediaâs future. For a while, particularly ahead of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, it even looked as though it might be a success story. It lured famous writers and tech-company investors and went public in 1999. At the time, Salon was valued at $107 million. âI think itâs very similar to what a Vox or a Buzzfeed seems today,â said Kerry Lauerman, who joined Salon in 2000 and would serve as the siteâs editor in chief from 2010 to 2013. âThere was, at first, a lot of money and excitement about Salon. There was no one else, really, in that space. ... It was kind of a brave new world, and Salon was at the forefront.â Over the last several months,  has interviewed more than two dozen current and former Salon employees and reviewed years of Salonâs SEC filings. On Monday, after  had made several unsuccessful attempts to interview Salon CEO Cindy Jeffers, the company dropped a bombshell: Jeffers was leaving the company effective immediately in what was described as an âabrupt departure.â While the details of Salonâs enormous management and business challenges dominate the internal discussion at the magazine, in liberal intellectual and media circles it is widely believed that the site has lost its way. âI remember during the Bush years reading them relatively religiously,â Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, told . âEspecially over the last year, they seem to have completely jumped the shark in so many ways. Theyâve become â and I think this is sad â theyâve definitely become like a joke, which is terrible for people who care about these progressive institutions.â So, what happened? *** After the dot-com crash, the companyâs stock price plummeted, and it has struggled financially ever since. But despite business challenges, it remained influential for years, with a stable of respected names â Miller, Heather Havrilesky, Jake Tapper, Glenn Greenwald and Joan Walsh among them â and a knack for picking talented young writers who would go on to become big names, like Rebecca Traister, Alex Pareene, Irin Carmon and Steve Kornacki. But that has changed, according to many former readers and Salon employees who spoke to . On social media, some have ridiculed the site for its questionable hot takes on the 2016 election and torqued-up lifestyle pieces that wouldnât pass muster at any serious publication, like âFarewell, once-favorite organ: I am officially breaking up with my penis.â Salonâs treatment of mainstream Democrats is also a question. The left-leaning site has historically been a reliable supporter of Democrats, and built its reputation defending Bill and Hillary Clinton during the Clinton impeachment hearings in 1998. The siteâs early bias in favor of Howard Deanâs 2004 campaign showed the siteâs willingness to strike out against neoliberalism in favor of progressive causes. But in the end Salon always circled the wagons. In recent months Salon has refused to do that. It has developed a reputation for being not just sympathetic to Bernie Sanders, but overtly hostile to Hillary Clinton, unable to distinguish her from Donald Trump in the same way Ralph Nader saw no difference between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000. Salon contributor H.A. Goodman has written several columns for the publication with titles like âI wouldnât vote for Dick Cheney, so I wonât vote for Hillary Clinton: An unrepentant only-Sanders voter fires back at criticsâ and âPlease, FBI â youâre our last hope: The Democratic Partyâs future rests upon your probe of Hillary Clintonâs emails.â (The columns spurred a debate in Salonâs newsroom after a staffer sent an email to colleagues saying Goodmanâs articles reflected badly on the company.) Actually, Salon isnât uniformly pro-Sanders. Editor in chief David Daley told  that he aims to cover all of the intellectual arguments surrounding the Democratic Party, and that Goodmanâs viewpoint is one of âa wide range of voices assessing the Clinton and Sanders campaignsâ on Salon. Late last year, the site faced allegations of bias against Sanders when Daley hired feminist writer Amanda Marcotte, who got to work writing negative stories about âBernie Bros.â The more stinging critique is about the quality of what Salon publishes â and Goodmanâs pieces in particular have reignited lamentations about the siteâs downward spiral. Walsh and Miller have been outspoken on Twitter about some of the stories from the site, as have many others. Two guys even created a vicious parody account, @salondotcom, to mock Salonâs increasingly strident brand of leftism, with fake tweets like âTen signs your cat might be racistâ and âShould GMOs come with trigger warnings?â âIt's really sad,â Talking Points Memo publisher Josh Marshall tweeted last month. âThese Salon headlines are like the bastard child of World Net Daily and the LaRouche Times â¦ In retrospect it's scary to think that Salon was maybe always just one @joanwalsh or @KerryLauerman away from derp oblivion.â Salon does have its defenders, and Greenwald, one of the most famous writers to come out of Salon and a staunch critic of Clinton, ascribes much of the criticism to politics. âI think the increasingly strident critiques of Salon have much more to do with its willingness to publish a lot of content outside of the Democratic Party mainstream â especially articles very critical of Hillary Clinton â than it does any supposed concern over the decline of its quality,â he said. But former staffers almost uniformly disagree, and they attribute Salonâs current editorial quality to Jeffersâ goal of getting big traffic numbers and paying little attention to the siteâs editorial side. \"We adopted a Huffington Post model, but we didn't have the resources to scale in a way that would've allowed for that kind of a model to actually work. We had 20 people, not 300,â one former staffer said. âI don't think Cindy ever realized that, and instead of modernizing within reason, while protecting the integrity of the brand â which was Salon's most valuable asset, by far â she decided to go full tilt for traffic, and it destroyed the brand.\" *** In 1994, Talbot, then the Arts and Ideas editor at the San Francisco Examiner, dreamed up what would later become Salon. He had chewed over the possibility of launching a magazine for years, but the cost of starting a print publication in the mid-90s was prohibitive, Salonâs founding executive editor Gary Kamiya recalled in a post commemorating Salonâs 10th anniversary. Instead, Talbot turned to the Internet â and specifically to former Apple executive Richard Gingras, who is now working at Google â to help fund the project. Gingras pulled together an initial $60,000 in seed funding for Salon with money from Appleâs marketing budget. Another benefactor, Adobe Ventures, swooped in with a $2 million investment that allowed Salon to get off the ground. After brainstorming ideas, Talbotâs wife, Camille Peri, came up with the name for the site. With no example of what an online magazine should look or feel like, and without a model of how an online magazine should operate, Talbot and a team made up of mostly ex-Examiner staffers launched Salon.com in the fall of 1995. The siteâs ambitious writing and impressive slate of contributing writers prompted early accolades. âSalonâs heart still beats to the rhythm of the old world: longish feature stories, Q&Aâs with literary lions like Salman Rushdie, John Updike and David Foster Wallace,â Rolling Stone contributing editor Jeff Goodell wrote in the spring of 1996 about the web magazine. âThereâs some excellent writing here, particularly Joyce Millman, whose pop-culture riffs are a hoot. A recent piece by novelist Denis Johnson about bikers for Jesus could have just as easily run in Harperâs.â Three years after it launched, Salon was catapulted into the national spotlight with the publication of âThis Hypocrite Broke Up My Family,â a story alleging that former Republican Rep. Henry Hyde, who was leading the effort to impeach Bill Clinton, had carried out a years-long extramarital affair of his own. The story burst open a nationwide scandal that prompted outrage from both Republicans and Democrats (albeit for different reasons). Hyde admitted the affair, chalking it up to âyouthful indiscretions,â becoming neither the first, nor the last, politician in the 1990s to admit to infidelities. Salon hired security at its San Francisco offices when it received bomb threats after the story appeared â just one way that staffers knew the magazineâs first big scoop had made a splash. â[The Henry Hyde story] changed a lot for us,â said Walsh, who joined Salon just as the Hyde story was published. âWe got a lot of attention. Some of it was negative â a lot of it negative, honestly. But it really put us on the map as people who were fearless and were going to throw some elbows along the way.â The Hyde revelation also served as a success story for Salonâs publishing model. The concept of an online magazine had been somewhat of a novelty in 1995, but the impact of the Hyde story was so deafening it changed how people thought about the possibilities of publishing on the web. âIt taught us that â¦ the web rewarded quickness, the web rewarded saying something that other people were not saying,â Walsh said. âThe web also rewarded speed.â After a beat, she added: âAt that time, the web rewarded reporting as well. I used to make the case that it's still like that, but I'm not sure I feel that way anymore.â The type of journalism Salon did in its early years was only made possible by cash from its benefactors â John Warnock, a co-founder and chairman of Adobe, and Bill Hambrecht, a wealthy Silicon Valley venture capitalist. For more than two decades, the two investors have watered Salon with millions of dollars. Warnock became involved before Salon even got off the ground via a $2 million investment from Adobe Ventures. Hambrecht joined later, and in Salonâs first two years, Warnock and Hambrecht invested a reported $5.5 million in the company. The funds allowed Talbot to send political reporters on the campaign trail and hire international stringers to do the reporting that shaped Salonâs early years. âIt was a couple-year period that Salon would never really have again where you could experiment with things. We had people on the campaign trail, which is insanely expensive,â Lauerman said. âWe were doing everything that the major players were doing.â But Hambrechtâs investment in Salon was also a vehicle for him to test out a project of his own: an unconventional tactic of taking a company public called a Dutch Auction. Hambrecht, who launched an investment group in 1998 dedicated to the strategy, would famously help persuade Google to use a Dutch Auction when it went public in 2004. In June of 1999, Hambrecht helped take Salon public, which netted the company $25 million. At the end of its first day, Salon stock was trading at around $10 a share. The influx of cash was critical for Salon to continue its operations at the time, but the timing couldnât have been worse. Salon used its IPO money to pay its debts and go on a hiring spree, but after the dot-com crash its stock plummeted, and the company had to undergo its first-ever round of layoffs only a year after it went public. In 2002, the company was delisted from NASDAQ after its stock failed to hit more than $1 per share, and Salon had to issue a warning that it âmay not be able to continue as a going concernâ because of its history of losses and slumping revenue. As of May 2016, the stock was trading at around 10 cents per share. Salon tried mightily to achieve profitability, and out of necessity became one of the first publishers to test out various ways to monetize its site. Salon Premium, Salonâs first subscription product, launched in April 2001 as âa last-ditch effort to save the business,â according to a former staffer. The site began gating off a few stories every day, but by the end of the year, all of Salonâs news stories became inaccessible to non-subscribers. Later, the site would try out a middle-ground approach â if non-subscribers sat through a 30-second video advertisement, they would receive a daily pass to access the site for free. By the end of 2004, Salonâs subscription program peaked at 89,100 subscribers, each paying around $30 annually. And while Salon Premium saved the business at the time, some former Salon staff members believe erecting the paywall stunted the siteâs growth. âWe were doing this right as the whole blog moment was exploding,â Lauerman said. âThere was this great democratization of the web, and we were suddenly behind this gate. It took a long time to recover from that.â During the paywall years, readership and traffic flattened, even as other sites benefited from the mainstreaming of the Internet and the popularity of blogging, said one former staffer. âThe quality of our content was excellent, better than other places, but the business model was really keeping people away,â another former staffer said. Lauerman, who joined the company in 2000, said that in the aftermath of the dot-com crash, Salon was âconstantly pivoting in order to make sense of this new reality and come up with a business model that would work.â With the pivoting came a bumpier road in journalistic ambition and quality, as the company continually tried and failed to match expenses with new business ideas. In February of 2005, Talbot, who was serving as both CEO and editor in chief, stepped down. The board tapped Elizabeth Hambrecht â then Salonâs president and CFO, a member of the board and the daughter of investor Bill Hambrecht â to replace Talbot as CEO. Walsh, then Salonâs managing editor, was promoted to editor in chief. Walsh served in that position for the next five years, and under her direction the company tried out a number of alternative revenue streams, like Open Salon, a âcurated blog networkâ that was nominated for a National Magazine Award in 2009. Walsh also began putting the companyâs content in front of the paywall, undermining Salon Premium, which by that time was in desperate need of new security features and other repairs. During Walshâs tenure, Salonâs C-suite was a revolving door: Elizabeth Hambrecht was CEO from February 2005 through September 2007, Chris Neimeth was CEO from September 2007 through September 2008, Elizabeth Hambrecht was CEO again from September 2008 through May 2009 and Richard Gingras, the tech and media maven who set up Salonâs first funding round, was CEO from May 2009 until July 2011. Gingras said he encouraged Hambrecht and Warnock to take the company private. It probably would have cost less than $1 million for Hambrecht and Warnock to buy out the other investors and take the company private, but they wanted Salon to remain a public company. In the middle of Gingrasâ tenure as CEO, Walsh stepped down as editor in chief and become editor at large. She was replaced by Lauerman, the siteâs executive editor. In a subtle shift, Lauerman began reporting to Gingras, the CEO. Previously, the CEO and editor in chief had been treated as equals. Talbot returned as CEO in September 2011 to replace Gingras, who left Salon to join Google. Under Talbotâs watch, Salon shuttered its online discussion forum Table Talk, and the company attempted an unsuccessful merger with Michael Wolffâs news aggregation site, newser.com. Talbot also announced that he wanted to resurrect Salonâs paid subscription offering. In a statement encouraging people to sign up, he warned that a revenue strategy based on aggregation â a shot at the surging Huffington Post â could never support independent journalism. âNowadays the Web is dominated by the robotic news recycling of big aggregation sites. But these news recyclers will never create the courageous and original journalism that the country desperately needs,â he said. âBy joining Salon Core, supporters can help ensure that Salon remains independent, free of the corporate forces that dominate the rest of the media.â Talbotâs return was short-lived. After only nine months, he left the company for the second and final time in May 2012. People close to the company said he was pushed out by the board because of a series of expensive and ultimately unsuccessful experiments, which also included an attempt to launch an original video unit called Salon Studios. Talbot declined to comment for this article. After Talbot left, the board replaced him with Jeffers, a young veteran of The Huffington Post who had joined the company as chief technology officer just a few weeks before. Jeffers arrived when the company was in a dire financial situation, and honed in on a revenue model based almost entirely on display advertising, ending the companyâs paid subscription service in the process. âWe were on the brink of disaster,â someone close to the company said. âThere was a failed video studio. There was a failed paid model. So what does that leave you with? It leaves you advertising.â The relentless focus on pageviews wasnât entirely new. While Gingras served as CEO, traffic was âamong everyoneâs interest and concern,â a former staffer said, and during his tenure the company began pushing for staffers to aggregate on top of their regular reporting efforts, mostly in the siteâs news section. After Salon shut down its paid subscription service in 2012, the company saw little financial incentive to invest in the kind of in-depth reporting that people would pay for. Now, Salonâs revenue was tied almost entirely to the number of people who visited the site. Jeffersâ new strategy also valued video content, since video ads command higher rates than banner ads. At first, Salon just focused on publishing video clips taken from other sources, like popular TV shows, but starting in 2015, the company hired a handful of video producers to begin an original video production unit. But above all, the new strategy rewarded aggregation and provocation â in other words, hot takes. Both are easy to produce at scale, since they do not require writers to spend time reporting out a story. âWith [Gingras] and [Talbot], the emphasis was maintaining a valuable brand,â said another person close to the company. âWhen Cindy came on, she became focused much more on coming up with goals for traffic, increasing the number of posts and charting it month-to-month so every month we would have very specific traffic goals we were trying to meet.â Salonâs most recent annual report spells out the strategy in more detail. âIn May 2012, we adopted a strategy that has led to the most significant period of user growth in our history. In June 2015, we reached our all-time high of 19.6 million unique users as measured by Google Analytics. Our strategy focuses on growing our user base, which in turn increases our attractiveness to advertisers, leading to growth in revenue.â Lauerman, then the editor in chief, was assigned to implement the siteâs new strategy. He hired three staffers charged with aggregating five to six stories throughout the day for the siteâs different verticals. Lauerman told  that when he implemented the plan, he hoped it would free up other staffers to spend more time on longer, more thoughtful pieces. Not everyone was happy with Lauermanâs leadership under the new strategy. Some staffers recall that the financial pressures led to tense meetings where traffic became the main concern. âKerry could be really hard to work for, and there were some people who did not work well under Kerry,â one staffer recalled. âBut he also wanted to run these big stories. He wanted to rise above the grind and do something significant.â Lauerman left the company in 2013, and Daley, the executive editor who had joined the company as culture editor about two years earlier, was named editor in chief. A person familiar with the company said that the business pressures at the time remained intense, and Daley seemed committed to keeping the ship afloat. If Salon needed to get to a certain level of traffic to keep the lights on, Daley would answer: How do we do it? In his nearly three years as editor in chief, Daley has carried out Jeffersâ strategy, helping lead the site to an era of unprecedented traffic growth. The company has ratcheted up its social media presence and began publishing more frequently â especially on the weekends, doubling weekend traffic. In June 2015, the site peaked at 19.6 million unique visitors. Thatâs nearly triple the seven million unique visitors that the site received at the end of 2011. (Meanwhile, The Huffington Post had about 214 million monthly unique visitors as of June 2015.) âWeâve grown Salon to the readership levels it needs with high-quality, sophisticated work by a brilliant team of writers and editors,â Daley told . Eleven current and former staffers also said Daley assigned staffers to write repeatedly about certain subjects that he believed would drive high traffic. If traffic was too low, according to six former staffers, Daley would go into the CMS and write posts himself, often posting them under the byline âSalon Staff.â To improve the amount of traffic on Saturdays and Sundays, certain staffers were asked to work over the weekend and post short video clips from television programs like âThe Daily Show.â It became harder to find âhigh-qualityâ work amid all the clutter. Twelve current and former employees said they were discouraged from doing original journalism out of a concern that time spent reporting could be better spent writing commentary and aggregate stories. Even the siteâs marquee names, like Walsh and Miller, were expected to produce quick hits and commentary on trending topics, staffers said. The strategy alienated some of Salonâs longtime journalists. âThe low point arrived when my editor G-chatted me with the observation that our traffic figures were lagging that day and ordered me to âpublish something within the hour,ââ Andrew Leonard, who left Salon in 2014, recalled in a post. âWhich, translated into my new reality, meant âGo troll Twitter for something to get mad about â Uber, or Mark Zuckerberg, or Tea Party Republicans â and then produce a rant about it.â â¦ I performed my duty, but not without thinking, âIs this what 25 years as a dedicated reporter have led to?â Thatâs when it dawned on me: I was no longer inventing the future. I was a victim of it. So I quit my job to keep my sanity.â Last month, there were more departures when the company implemented a round of layoffs. Ruth Henrich, who had been with Salon since the 1990s, was one of six staffers let go. And after the layoffs, two more Salon staffers departed, including deputy editor Peter Finocchiaro. (Daley said the amount of turnover year-over-year is standard for the company over the past several years.) On one level, the strategy has worked. Salonâs decision to double down on increased pageviews helped gradually increase the companyâs revenue, and in the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2015 (the most recent quarter for which data is publicly available), Salon had $1.95 million in revenue and $2.19 million in expenses, for a net loss of about $250,000. Thatâs better than the year before â in the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2014, Salon had $1.47 million in revenue and $2.27 million in expenses, for a net loss of about $800,000 â but itâs still a net loss. Many websites would be thrilled to be closing in on self-sustainability. But hereâs one area where Salonâs long history is a disadvantage: At the end of 2015, Salon had an accumulated deficit of $124 million. This week, Salonâs board of directors replaced Jeffers with Jordan Hoffner, a media veteran and venture capitalist who has worked at places like NBCUniversal, Google and YouTube, and founded investment firm TCP Advisors. Hoffner, who is based in San Francisco, flew to New York on Monday to meet with Salon executives and staffers on the East Coast. According to people who spoke to Hoffner during his visit, the new chief executive talked about building out a media group and said he had a goal of raising Salonâs stock price. Itâs uncertain what exactly Salonâs board and Hoffner are planning to do â Bill Hambrecht and John Warnock could not be reached for comment, a call to Warnockâs son was not returned, and Elizabeth Hambrecht and Hoffner declined to be interviewed through a company spokesperson. But Hoffnerâs history, and what he told staff, indicates that Salonâs future might hold some big moves â attracting new investors, launching new products, acquiring smaller companies â that will drive up its stock price and eventually make it into a real acquisition target. Daley told  the day after Hoffnerâs hire that the company is not for sale, but some people close to the company privately speculate that the intention could change as Hoffner takes over the C-suite. It seems there is a sense of urgency about Salonâs future. Hambrecht is in his early 80s, and Warnock is 75. Because Salon has run deficits for almost every quarter since it was founded, the company has relied on regular interest-free cash advances from Warnock, chairman of Salonâs board, and Hambrecht, a board member. From Salonâs founding until the end of 2015, the most recent data available, Warnock and Hambrecht have given the company nearly $20 million in cash advances, and Warnock also personally guaranteed a $1 million line of credit. âYou have two founders who are aging who were writing six-figures checks every year to cover operating costs,â one person close to the company said. If Salonâs continued existence remains dependent on them, the company could be in a precarious position. People close to the company are not sure whether Warnockâs heirs will be as willing to continue covering the Salonâs expenses as he has been over the years. For years, staffers and Salon readers assumed that Warnock, a staunch First Amendment supporter, backed the site financially because of his commitment to journalism and to Salonâs mission. People have predicted Salonâs collapse almost since it launched. âCan Salon, or any other Internet content site, survive by itself?,â Scott Herhold wrote for the Mercury News in 1997. âCall it a hunch, but I don't think the online magazine Salon will survive year one of the Clinton Downturn,â Alex Beam of the Globe Staff predicted in 2001. In 2005, on Salonâs 10th anniversary, Talbot described the mass of media predictions about Salonâs impending demise as a âgleeful death watch.â Lauerman remembers going-out-of-business stories predicting Salonâs closure âgoing back to 2001.â So in some ways, Salon has beaten the odds simply by surviving this long. But to others, the true Salon was lost once it stopped publishing the types of stories that once made it so well-regarded. âI love that Salon still sails on, years after I left. I will always think of it as my baby (all grown up and away from home),â Talbot said on Reddit late last year. âOf course I always think of ways it can be improved -- and yes, I'd like to see more investigative reporting to balance its commentary. That's how Salon's name was made. It's expensive and hard to do. But hopefully that tradition will be revived at some point.â Miller, and many other former Salon staffers, just want to see the company preserve its history. Some of the high-impact reports, essays and reviews from the siteâs glory years are lost behind a tangled mess of broken links and deteriorating web pages. Older stories can be nearly impossible to find. âThere is a need to preserve this, if you think there is something there even worth preserving, and worth thinking about,â Miller said. âIn 30 years, who knows where Salon will be then? Then it will seem important to people.â © 2019  LLC",

        "articles": "Congress The majority leader’s comments drew a strong rebuke from Bernie Sanders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell walks to the Senate floor on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 30, 2020. | AP Photo/Susan Walsh By BURGESS EVERETT and QUINT FORGEY 12/31/2020 10:31 AM EST Updated: 12/31/2020 02:03 PM EST Link Copied Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dubbed the effort to increase direct payments to $2,000 “socialism for rich people,” eliciting an incredulous reaction from Sen. Bernie Sanders as the GOP Senate continued to decline to take up the matter on Thursday. In his second consecutive day of attacks on the bill, McConnell accused Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of engineering a bill that sends \"thousands of dollars to people who don’t need the help.\" He also blocked requests from Schumer and Sanders (I-Vt.) to hold votes on the bill this week. “Borrowing from our grandkids to do socialism for rich people is a terrible way to get help to families who actually need it,” McConnell said of an effort to boost the checks from $600 to $2,000, which is supported by President Donald Trump. “Washington Democrats took President Trump’s suggestion and skewed it so the checks would benefit even more high-earning households.” McConnell said \"socialism for rich people\" four times in his speech. Sanders responded in a fiery fashion: \"The majority leader helped lead this body to pass Trump's tax bill. You want to talk about socialism for the rich Mr. Majority Leader?!” Led by McConnell, many Republicans say the measure the House approved earlier this week delivers too much aid to six-figure earners. The House’s bill would send checks to higher earners more than the two previous rounds of direct payments, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “Imagine a family of five where the parents earn $250,000 per year and have not seen any income loss this past year. Speaker Pelosi and Senator Sanders want to send them $5,000 from Uncle Sam,\" McConnell said. Sanders retorted that in the bill \"virtually nothing goes to the very, very rich. The overwhelming majority of those funds go to the middle class, the working class, low-income people who in the midst of the pandemic are in desperate economic condition.\" Plus, Trump has tweeted supportively of what the House did and some Senate Republicans say they support it. The House is gone until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. Schumer joined an effort from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to press McConnell to allow a stand-alone vote on $2,000 stimulus checks in addition to Trump’s demands for an election fraud commission and repealing tech protections for big tech companies. McConnell has rolled the three issues together in one bill, which stands little chance of passing. “Democrats are willing to vote on all the other issues the Republicans say the president supposedly cares about. Just let us vote on a clean bill for the $2,000 checks,” Schumer said. In a Thursday morning interview on “Fox & Friends,” Graham assessed that “if you had a stand-alone vote on the $2,000 check, it might pass” the Senate. And although “70 percent of Republicans don’t want to go to 2,000 [dollars],” he said, “I’m with the president on this.” Trump threw near-finalized coronavirus relief negotiations into a state of confusion last week when he ordered Congress to increase the amount of direct payments to individual Americans to $2,000. The president also called on lawmakers to establish an election fraud commission and repeal legal protections for social media companies — known as Section 230 — but he ultimately signed the stimulus package over the weekend without securing any of his demands. The House voted overwhelmingly on Monday to approve $2,000 stimulus checks. McConnell, however, refused a stand-alone vote on the direct payments, instead tying them to Trump’s other two requests — which were viewed as poison pills by Democrats. On Wednesday, after Trump again insisted upon “$2000 ASAP!” in a tweet, McConnell said the proposal had “no realistic path to quickly pass the Senate” and refused to split the White House’s legislative wish list into separate measures. But that was exactly what Graham pressed the Republican leader to do on Thursday. “Here’s what I’d like: I’d like a stand-alone vote in the new Congress on the $2,000 check,” Graham said. “We have seven Republicans who’ve already said they would vote for it. We need five more. I think if we had the vote, we would get there.” The president, Graham added, “wants three things: a commission to investigate fraud, $2,000 checks, and to repeal Section 230. I’m urging Senator McConnell to give a stand-alone vote in the new Congress after January 3rd on all three measures.” Graham is likely to get little support for the proposal even after the new Congress convenes on Monday. Later Thursday morning, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin — another top Republican ally of the president — renounced the prospect of $2,000 payments, citing concerns about the national debt and the need for more targeted relief. He also blocked $1,200 payments last week. “I know it sounds good, it feels good to give away money. Everybody loves benefits,” Johnson told CNBC. “[But] somebody has got to be thinking about … the effect of this on our future generations.” Link Copied © 2021  LLC",

        "articles": "The push includes random phone checks overseen by White House lawyers. By ANNIE KARNI and ALEX ISENSTADT 02/26/2017 11:55 AM EST Updated 02/26/2017 05:25 PM EST Press secretary Sean Spicer is cracking down on leaks coming out of the West Wing, with increased security measures that include random phone checks of White House staffers, overseen by White House attorneys. The push to snuff out leaks to the press comes after a week in which President Donald Trump strongly criticized the media for using unnamed sources in stories and expressed growing frustration with the unauthorized sharing of information by individuals in his administration. Last week, after Spicer became aware that information had leaked out of a planning meeting with about a dozen of his communications staffers, he reconvened the group in his office to express his frustration over the number of private conversations and meetings that were showing up in unflattering news stories, according to sources in the room. Upon entering Spicer’s office for what one person briefed on the gathering described as “an emergency meeting,” staffers were told to dump their phones on a table for a “phone check,\" to prove they had nothing to hide. Spicer, who consulted with White House counsel Don McGahn before calling the meeting, was accompanied by White House lawyers in the room, according to multiple sources. There, he explicitly warned staffers that using texting apps like Confide — an encrypted and screenshot-protected messaging app that automatically deletes texts after they are sent — and Signal, another encrypted messaging system, was a violation of the Presidential Records Act, according to multiple sources in the room. By MATTHEW NUSSBAUM and NOLAN D. MCCASKILL The phone checks included whatever electronics staffers were carrying when they were summoned to the unexpected follow-up meeting, including government-issued and personal cellphones. Spicer also warned the group of more problems if news of the phone checks and the meeting about leaks was leaked to the media. It's not the first time that warnings about leaks have promptly leaked. The State Department's legal office issued a four-page memo warning of the dangers of leaks, and that memo was immediately posted by The Washington Post. But with mounting tension inside the West Wing over stories portraying an administration lurching between crises and simmering in dysfunction, aides are increasingly frustrated by the pressure-cooker environment and worried about their futures there. Within the communications office, the mood has grown tense. During a recent staff meeting, Spicer harshly criticized some of the work deputy communications director Jessica Ditto had done, causing her to cry, according to two people familiar with the incident. \"The only time Jessica recalls almost getting emotional is when we had to relay the information on the death of Chief Ryan Owens,\" Spicer said, referring to the Navy SEAL killed recently in action in Yemen. Ditto also denied the accounts. \"This is 100 percent not true,\" she said Sunday after the incident was reported. \"Sean and I have a great working relationship.\" Spicer declined to comment about the leak crackdown. By TARA PALMERI The campaign to sniff out a series of damaging leaks, which Spicer is convinced originated from his communications department, has led to a tense environment in the West Wing. During meetings, the press secretary has repeatedly berated his aides, launching expletive-filled tirades in which he’s accused them of disclosing sensitive information to reporters and saying that they’ve disappointed him. As word of the hunt has ripped through the office, talk has turned to the question of whether firings are to come. Spicer was particularly incensed by the leaks last week that Michael Dubke had been tapped as the new White House communications director — a hire that became public before it was officially announced. “In general,” said one senior administration official, “there is a lot of insecurity.” While other parts of the White House appear to be stabilizing, the press shop is often a center of frustration about how things are going — and not just from Spicer, who fumes to aides about stories he doesn’t like. For Trump, a cable TV addict who has long obsessively tracked news coverage about himself, the ongoing turmoil in the White House communications wing threatens to derail the media narrative that will help to define the opening days of his presidency. His decision to hold a free-flowing news conference last week, two senior officials said, stemmed from a recognition that he was no longer breaking through in a news cycle that had turned against him. “He reached a breaking point where he wanted to do it himself,” said one senior White House aide. It has not been lost on senior White House officials that Spicer is overseeing an overwhelmed press office, where work often begins just after 6 a.m. and ends close to midnight. To help streamline the office, the administration has tapped Dubke, a veteran under-the-radar Republican operative known for his organizational skills. Yet the move has infuriated Trump campaign aides, who argue that someone who’d been a vocal Trump supporter — which the establishment-minded Dubke hadn’t been — should have gotten the job.“People are on fire about it,” one campaign veteran said of the Dubke hire. Defense By BRYAN BENDER Multiple former campaign aides said they were under the impression that RNC veterans pushed through Dubke, who is close with Republican strategist Karl Rove, with relatively little consultation with others in Trump world. (Several other people interviewed for the post, including Jarrod Agen, a spokesman for Vice President Mike Pence, and Scott Jennings, a former political aide in the George W. Bush White House.) To some degree, the challenge Spicer and other press aides face is unique — they are working for a president who takes an unusually intense interest in the work his communications office does. Trump is known to watch Spicer’s daily press briefings while eating lunch in the White House dining room. While the president was critical of his press secretary in the administration’s first month — especially after he was parodied on “Saturday Night Live” — he more recently has offered the press secretary his private assurances that his job is safe. The push to crack down on leaks follows a week in which the president ratcheted up his criticism of the press and condemned the free flow of information from parts of his administration. On Friday, Trump called the media the “enemy of the American people” during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in which he railed against journalists for using anonymous sources. “I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It’s fake, phony, fake,” Trump said. “A few days ago, I called the fake news ‘the enemy of the people,’ and they are. They are the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources. They just make them up when there are none.” Later on Friday, Spicer blocked certain media, including CNN, The New York Times, BuzzFeed and , from attending an off-camera press briefing in his office. Time and The Associated Press boycotted the briefing out of solidarity. On Saturday, Trump said he would not attend the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner in Washington.

        "articles": "Getty The Friday Cover Carly Fiorina dared Democrats to name it. 20 top Dems accepted the challenge. By  MAGAZINE September 17, 2015 âIf you want to stump a Democrat, ask them to name an accomplishment of Hillary Clinton,â Carly Fiorina quipped at Wednesdayâs Republican debate. The line got hearty applauseâbut it also cut to the core of one of the defining lines of attacks against the former first lady and Democratic presidential frontrunner. After nearly forty years in public life, what exactly has she accomplished? Itâs a question that even, at times, has tripped up Clinton herself: During her 2014 book tour, when ABCâs Diane Sawyer asked her about her âmarquee achievement,â Clinton changed the subject and she fumbled over a similar question during a womenâs forum in Manhattan last year. âI see my role as secretaryâin fact leadership in general in a democracyâas a relay race. You run the best race you can run, you hand off the baton. Some of what hasnât been finished may go on to be finished,â she told Thomas Friedman. âIâm very proud of the [economic] stabilization and the really solid leadership that the administration provided that I think now leads us to be able to deal with problems like Ukraine because weâre not so worried about a massive collapse in Europe.â The question Fiorina posed has also tripped up members of the Obama administration. When State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki was asked last year to âidentify one tangible achievementâ accomplished through one of Hillary Clintonâs key projects as Secretary of Stateâthe first-ever audit of the departmentâPsaki punted, âI am certain that those who were here at the time, who worked hard on that effort, could point out one.â Hillaryâs supporters have been stumped too. When Bloomberg Politicsâ Mark Halperin asked a focus group of Iowans this summer about Hillary Clintonâs accomplishments, one Democratic supporter said, âI honestly canât say I followed along [with] everything that was going on.â So is Fiorina right? Are Democrats really unable to defend Clintonâs record on the merits? To find out,  Magazine on Thursday asked the nationâs top Democratic leaders and thinkers to name Hillary Clintonâs biggest accomplishment. What is the most impressive item on Clintonâs record? Which legislative or policy triumph from her many years in office will be most important on the campaign trail? Not surprisingly, those surveyed all came up with an answer to defend their partyâs likely presidential nominee. Whether these count as âmarquee,â âsignificant,â or âtangibleâ? You be the judge. *** âItâs kind of hard to pick one accomplishmentâ By Bill Burton, former senior strategist for Priorities USA Action, a super PAC in support of President Barack Obama. Itâs kind of hard to pick one accomplishment for Hillary Clinton. Personally, Iâm sure sheâd say her daughter and grandchild are her greatest accomplishments. Professionally, how about these three? 1. Her China speech on women.2. Her role in killing Osama bin Laden.3. Management of the State Department during which time we saw a 50 percent increase in exports to China, aggressive work on climate (particularly at Copenhagen), and the effort to create and implement the toughest sanctions ever on Iranâhelping to lead us to the agreement currently on the table. *** âThe sanction on Iran that brought them to the tableâ Howard Dean is the former governor of Vermont and the former chair of the Democratic National Committee. Hillary Clinton was the principal author of the sanction on Iran that brought them to the table. We cannot afford any Know Nothings like Carly in the White House. *** âNearly every foreign policy victory of President Obamaâs second term has Secretary Clintonâs fingerprints on itâ By Harry Reid, Senate Democratic leader. American foreign policy was stronger when Hillary Clinton left the State Department than when she arrived. She took the reins from a Bush administration that had left Americaâs reputation deeply damaged and planted the seeds for the foreign policy successes we see today. From the agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, to the landmark normalization of relations with Cuba, nearly every foreign policy victory of President Obamaâs second term has Secretary Clintonâs fingerprints on it. Her accomplishments extend to health care, as well. As First Lady, she helped create and guide through Congress Childrenâs Health Insurance Program, a key program that brought health care coverage to millions of children. As a Senator, she worked across the aisle to provide full military health benefits to reservists and National Guard members. Secretary Clinton was also an outspoken champion for women around the world. She set records for travel while leading the State Department and used every trip to empower the women of the 112 countries she visited. She made gender equality a priority of U.S. foreign policy. And she created the ambassador at large for global womenâs issues, a post charged with integrating gender throughout the State Department. *** âThe SCHIP program â¦ which expanded health coverage to millions of lower-income childrenâ By Anita Dunn, Democratic political strategist. After universal health care failed in 1994, the Clinton Administration was reluctant to go anywhere near healthcare againâDemocrats lost the Senate and the House in 1994, and losing the house was for the first time in 40 years. Then-First Lady Hilary Clinton ended up being the White House ally and inside player who worked with Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch to create the SCHIP program in Clinton's second term, which expanded health coverage to millions of lower-income children. She has other accomplishments but this one made a huge difference, and came at a time when politically the Administration was cutting deals with Newt Gingrich on the budget and not necessarily all that enthusiastic about revisiting health care. This obviously isn't her only accomplishment but it is meaningful because she took a political battering after the failure in 1994 but came back to fight again, and was able to work on a bipartisan basis during a very polarized time to get this done. Seems relevant! *** âClinton is one of the most accomplished people ever to runâ By Chuck Schumer, U.S. Senator for New York, Democratic party. Hillary Clinton is one of the most accomplished people ever to run for the Presidency. Iâm lucky enough to have seen those accomplishments up close from her time as Senator from New York and as Secretary of State. Hillary Clinton was instrumental in helping secure $21 billion in federal aid to help New York rebuild after 9/11. She fought tooth and nail to protect the first responders who rushed into danger when the towers collapsed and was pivotal in the passage of legislation that helped those first responders who got sick get the care and treatment they deserved. She worked night and day to protect and create jobs in New York, whether that was at the Niagara Falls Air Force base or the Center for Bioinformatics at the University of Buffalo. She also led the charge on the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Equity Act, which is now the law of the land. 2016 By Elizabeth F. Ralph 2016 By Rick Wilson 2016 As Secretary of State, Secretary Clinton was not only inspirational figure for billions of women around the globe, she also did much to restore the shattered credibility of the United States, which had lost so much influence following the failed foreign policies of the previous administration. She negotiated the cease-fire in Gaza that stopped the Hamas from firing rocket after rocket into Israel. She helped secure the START treatyâs ratification, and has advanced womenâs rights in countries around the globe. Thatâs just a snapshot of what Hillary Clinton has accomplished over a lifetime of public service to New York and the country. If you really want to stump a Democrat, you should ask them which of Hillaryâs accomplishments is your favoriteâthere are too many to choose from *** âRebuilding Americaâs leadership and prestige overseas after the Bush yearsâ Bill Richardson is a former secretary of energy and governor of New Mexico. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was key in rebuilding Americaâs leadership and prestige overseas after the Bush years. She restored our alliances with the EU and key Asian allies as well as key relationships in Africa and Latin America. *** âThe Pediatric Research Equity Actâ By Chris Dodd, former U.S. Senator for Connecticut, Democratic party. Having worked with her in the Senate and on the HELP Committee, the first thing that came to mind was her authorship of the Pediatric Research Equity Act. This law requires drug companies to study their products in children. The Act is responsible for changing the drug labeling of hundreds of drugs with important information about safety and dosing of drugs for children. It has improved the health of millions of children who take medications to treat diseases ranging from HIV to epilepsy to asthma. Millions of kids are in better shape and alive because of the law Senator Clinton authored. *** âCrippling sanctions against Iranâ By Paul Begala, political analyst for CNN and counselor to President Bill Clinton. Easy: Iran sanctions. Sec. Clinton accomplished the nearly impossible mission of getting China, Russia, the European Union and the civilized world on board with crippling sanctions against Iran. This is what brought Iran to the negotiating table. Ms. Fiorina may not see that as an accomplishment, since while she was CEO of Hewlett-Packard the firm sold hundreds of millions of dollars of computer products the the terrorist regime in Tehran, evading US sanctions. *** âClinton struck major and consequential diplomatic achievementsâ By Bill Scher, senior writer at the Campaign for Americaâs Future. Hillary Clinton has four major accomplishments from her tenure as Secretary of State: winning the UN resolution supporting military intervention in Libya, the New START arms control treaty with Russia, renewing diplomatic ties with Myanmar and setting in the motion talks that culminated in the Iran nuclear deal. We don't see the Clinton campaign or other Democrats leap to cite most of these accomplishments because they come with degrees of future uncertainty and, in the case of Libya, associations with the tangentially related Benghazi attack. But they are significant accomplishments nonetheless. Clinton is often mocked for failing to âresetâ relations with Russia. But the New START treaty is being followed and helping contain tensions. She won Russiaâs support for UN sanctions on Iran that helping bring the rogue state to the negotiating table. And she cajoled Russia to abstain on the Libyan resolution, which was critical to securing its passage in the UN Security Council. (In fact, she may have âresetâ too well. Vladimir Putin, who was not President at the time, opposed the resolution and that may have contributed to his decision to reclaim his post.) The aftermath of that Libyan intervention has been messy, with rival governments fracturing the country, although unity talks are currently taking place. Myanmar has not been perfect either. The promise of released political prisoners has only been partially filled. And the military is being accused of manipulating the upcoming general election. Still the participation of the previously banned National League for Democracy party is a step forward. These are reminders that, in the real world, progress is often halting. But the fact remains that Clinton struck major and consequential diplomatic achievements, even if the final historical judgment on their lasting impact is years away. *** âIâve seen, first-hand, her exceptional work at every levelâ By Patrick Leahy, U.S. Senator for Vermont, Democratic party. Iâve seen, first-hand, her exceptional work at every levelâwhen she was in the White House as First Lady; later, when we were partners and neighbors as senators; and after that, when she was Secretary of State. Just one example, which is one of her enduring legacies as First Lady, was her partnership with Congress in developing the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which has improved access to essential health care for millions of kids. In the Senate we worked together on efforts to clean up Lake Champlain and to help Vermontâs and New Yorkâs family farmers. She was at the center of securing help for New Yorkâs 9/11 first responders. We worked together in enacting the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which was the first bill signed into law by President Obama. I was chairman of the State Departmentâs budget committee when she was Secretary of State, and I worked closely with herâweek to week, and sometimes day to dayâon a wide, wide range of issues and challenges, from human rights to global health. We traveled together to Haiti as we worked to help that country recover from the devastation of the earthquake. She had a leading role in securing tougher sanctions on Iran. We worked together to successfully overcome obstruction by House Republicans of the funding she requested to improve embassy security around the world. Some of her most important achievements were her steady, methodical efforts, with the President, to help reintroduce America to the world after the diplomatic setbacks under the previous administration. *** âShe was the point person â¦ compelling the Chinese to commit to cutting carbon emissions.â By David Axelrod, former Senior Advisor to President Barack Obama. When I was there, she played a very active role in rallying the world behind the global sanctions against Iran that brought them to the table over their nuclear program. She was the point person in Copenhagen in compelling the Chinese to commit to cutting carbon emissions. She personally negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Those are a few that come to mind. *** âThe Adoption and Safe Families Actâ By Neera Tanden, President of the Center for American Progress. As First Lady, Hillary was the point person in the Clinton Administration on the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, a bill that refocused adoption policies on the needs of the children, made it easier to remove children from abusive situations, provided support and services to adoptive families, and encouraged adoption of children with special needs. The bill increased foster adoptions by 64 percent by 2002. Hillary helped develop the idea behind this bill, first writing about it in a 1995 article. She went on to work with Republicans and Democrats in Congress, including moderate Rhode Island Republican John Chafee, to see the bill through to final passage, helping broker compromises to ensure the billâs passage. This was not a big bill that dominated headlines. But for every child who was placed in a loving home because of this legislation, Hillaryâs work was more than an accomplishment on a resume; it was an important part of the reason their lives were better. *** âClinton has at every turn fought for progress and opportunityâ By Tracy Sefl, former senior advisor to Ready for Hillary. Willful ignorance: that is what fuels this Republican talking point. The scope and significance of Hillary Clinton's work far exceeds a cable-ready soundbite, so perhaps in that regard Republicans find it easier to resort to an untruth. (After all, as we all saw Wednesday night at the Reagan Library, these are the science deniers.) The reality is that Hillary Clinton has at every turn fought for progress and opportunity. As her campaign continues, she'll continue to share exactly what those fights have entailed, and for whoâdomestically, on behalf of children, veterans, active military, first responders, victims of gender-based violence, family caregivers, pregnant women. As Secretary of State, she helped restore America's standing during challenging times, meaning that her tireless diplomatic efforts brought forth progress with tougher sanctions, missile reduction treaties, ceasefires and strengthened international coalitions. And critically, her core beliefâthat the improved lives of women and girls worldwide will leads to stronger and safer economiesâis proving to be transformational in the 21st Century. If this is what Republicans are leaning on as their key argument against Hillary Clinton, they are insulting the intelligence of the electorate. Argue with her about her record (it's clear sheâd welcome that!), but don't deny its existence. *** âThe new START Treatyâ By Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist. Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, led the negotiations that led to the new START Treaty, a landmark revision of our nuclear arms agreement with Russia. It received bipartisan support in Congress and represents a critical leg in our national security and a safer world. Carly Fiorina said in the debate that she would dump that treaty to show her strength to Putin. That isnât showing strengthâthat is just a dumb way to threaten global nuclear war. *** âA relentless advocate for women and childrenâ By Douglas Schoen, pollster for President Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton has been a relentless advocate for women and children. Throughout her long career in public office, she has championed women's reproductive rights as well as establishing the importance of early education. Clinton played a critical role in the creation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. Furthermore, as an equal pay proponent, Clinton introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act as well as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. On the campaign trail in 2015, she has stayed true to her staunch belief in gender equality, especially in the workplace, by championing a raise in the minimum wage as well as supporting policies like paid sick leave and maternity leave. Going forward, Clinton needs to continue to emphasize these cornerstone issues for her as well as focus on economic growth. We can't know what a Hillary Clinton presidency will look like without hearing clearly and explicitly how she will create jobs, foster and protect innovation and support the entrepreneurs that drive our economy. *** âGalvanizing the Senate after the tragedy of 9/11â By Barbara Boxer, U.S. Senator for California, Democratic party. Carly Fiorina wishes she had accomplished in a lifetime what Hillary Clinton has accomplished in any given year--from leading efforts to impose the toughest Iran sanctions in history to making women's rights central to our foreign policy to galvanizing the Senate after the tragedy of 9/11 to rebuild the city and take care of our brave first responders. *** âA âsmart powerâ diplomacyâ By Harold Koh, former Legal Adviser of the Department of State. As Secretary, Hillary Clinton defined and tried consistently to implement a âsmart powerâ diplomacy that combines diplomacy, development, aid, rule of law and private initiatives with limited applications of hard power to project U.S. global leadership abroad. In an age where our hard power resources are limited and near exhaustion, her approach is a much more promising than the Republicansâ to addressing our hardest global problems in the years ahead. The Iran nuclear deal, the multilateral trade talks and the climate change negotiations are only three current concrete examples of that approach in action. *** âShe helped hold together the Presidency and the countryâ By Dennis Kucinich, former U.S. Representative from Ohio. When the Clinton Administration was under attack and facing impeachment, Hillary Clinton slowed great courage, fortitude and perseverance. She helped hold together the Presidency and the country by virtue of her steadfastness and determination. Her conduct revealed an extraordinary resilience and grace under pressure, which are the hallmarks of a strong leader. Even more than her considerable work on health and education, her effort to be a unifying force at that time was important for America. *** âThe world is safer and people are more free thanks to Hillary Clintonâ By Donna Brazile, Democratic strategist and contributor to CNN and ABC News. Republican attacks on Hillary Clintonâs record are laughable. And Iâm old enough to remember when Carly Fiorina praised Hillary for having âdevoted her life to public serviceâ and pointed out that sheâs an âinspiration for many women.â As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was instrumental in building an international coalition around the toughest regime of sanctions against Iran in history. On the world stage, she is an unmatched leader. She went to Beijing 20 years ago and declared that womenâs rights are human rights. More recently, she stood before representatives of nations like Russia and Uganda and stated boldly that gay rights are human rights, too. Today, the world is safer and people are more free thanks to Hillary Clinton. Here at home, from her very first job out of law schoolâat the Childrenâs Defense FundâHillary Clinton has delivered results for Americans most at risk of discrimination and restricted opportunity. As First Lady, she championed healthcare reform at the comprehensive level and through SCHIP for children living in poverty. In the Senate she fought to raise the minimum wage, she stood up for 9/11 first responders and she was a tireless advocate for legislation to protect and expand the right to vote. Fiorina may disagree with Clinton on the issues, but she is wrong to dismiss the record of a woman who made progress possible here in this country and around the world *** âI have to call BS on this exerciseâ By Ed Kilgore, liberal commentator, blogger at Washington Monthlyâs Political Animal and Managing Editor at The Democratic Strategist. I'm sorry, I have to call BS on this exercise, if only because it is emanating from Carly Fiorina, whose public policy accomplishments are exactly âzero.â If, say, HRC had (as I think itâs clear she did) a formative effect on the long effort towards universal health coverage, itâs vastly more influence than Fiorina has ever had on public policy.

        "articles": "Win McNamee/Getty Images Off Message If Democrats retake the House, the Maryland congressman will likely become the new chair of the Oversight Committee. Hereâs a preview of what to expect. By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE October 02, 2018 Subscribe to Off Message on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Stitcher here. Elijah Cummings says he doesnât have a lot of patience, and he has even less trust. To him, Donald Trump âis a person [who] calls a lie âthe truthâ and the truth âa lie.ââ He thinks the president violates the Constitutionâs emoluments clause daily, and sees an abnormal tolerance for corruption and misconduct emanating straight out of the Oval Office. And, in the eyes of the 67-year-old Democrat, just as troubling is the notion that Congress has fallen flat on its constitutional duty to check the administration. Expect that to change if Democrats retake the House in November. Then, the Baltimore congressman is set to become the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, giving him subpoena power and the ability to call as many hearings as he wants on whichever topics he chooses. In light of everything heâs learned about Trumpâand especially after Senate testimony last week by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which Cummings saw as dishonestâthe congressman doubts heâll be able to believe any denial from anyone in the administration, regardless of whether theyâre under oath, he said in an interview for âs Off Message podcast. âOh no, no. Uh-uh. No,â Cummings said. âI worry more about getting documents. If I can get documents, it doesnât matter.â Excited by the polls, Democrats have been fantasizing about all the investigations theyâll launch when they control Congress, the way theyâll swamp the White House with more requests than a staff thatâs already stretched thinâone likely to see more departures after Novemberâwill be able to handle. Cummings is prepping targetsâfrom the security clearances of Trumpâs son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, to digging into how former EPA chief Scott Pruitt was able to keep his job for so longâand the list is getting longer by the week. Just last week, he says, he added to it claims by the Senate Judiciary Committeeâs staffâmade without further detailâthat two men had separately come forward to each claim responsibility for sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has alleged Kavanaugh assaulted her as a teenager. âI want to find out,â Cummings said. âDid [the staff] have someone who cameâor two peopleâwho came and admitted a crime, and what did they do about it? What are their names? Who are they? Iâd like for them to come before us and let us know what they did and when they did it and how they did it.â He jokes that watching the Judiciary Committee hearings is the only time he wishes he had run for Senate, as heâd considered doing for the seat that his former House colleague Chris Van Hollen won in 2016. After a year of health problems that had him laid up in the hospital for six months after heart surgeryâand still using a walker and a cane to recover from a knee injuryâCummings says his new sense of mortality has shot through his approach to the job. âLetâs cut through the unnecessary BS and letâs get to the factsâand I do not want anybody wasting my time. Nor do I want to waste the time of my committee members, or my family members,â Cummings said. âAnd I damn sure donât want to waste my time.â Cummings is a private man. Staffers whoâve known him for years donât know basic details of his personal life, the result of a clear division he draws between his family time and government work. He doesnât do many interviews. Heâs been in politics for 35 years, in Congress representing Baltimore since 1996. Most Sundays, heâs in church instead of working the TV show circuit. Heâs a proud member of the Congressional Black Caucus and has been since he got to Washington, but heâs deliberately not defined himself as a black leader in Congress. Heâs better known for burrowing down into committee work and gaining friends in every pocket of the caucus, including a number of Republicansâa fact that has some people thinking he could wind up as speaker of the House if Nancy Pelosi stumbles. Click here for the full podcast, including what Cummings says he learned from having two Pentecostal preachers as parents, and why his faith is defined by what he calls âa recycling god.â But even if she doesnât, if Democrats take the House, Cummings will be one of the three most important committee chairs going up against the White House, along with Californiaâs Adam Schiff on Intelligence, managing the Russia probe, and New Yorkâs Jerry Nadler on Judiciary, trying to thread the needle on a response to those calls for Trumpâs impeachment. âHe will not be bashful. He will be aggressive,â said Jason Chaffetz, the former Utah GOP congressman who chaired the Oversight Committee with Cummings as its ranking member. âAnd Iâll probably disagree with everything he does.â Chaffetz pointed out that Cummings, despite his friendship with President Barack Obama, co-signed 300 letters from the committee to provide oversight of the Obama administration. But Chaffetz warned that House Democrats may be overestimating how much theyâll be able to get out of a reluctant White House, and argued that they would have been better off joining with Republicans to demand intelligence information that the administration was trying to keep secret. âIf [North Carolina Rep.] Mark Meadows and [Ohio Rep.] Jim Jordan canât get documents out of the White House, I donât know why Elijah Cummings and the Democrats think theyâll do any better,â Chaffetz said. Sit down with Cummings for a while, and the frustration comes out, punctuated with the occasional âcome on, now!â Heâs still annoyed about what happened after he approached Trump at the post-inauguration luncheon to say they could work together on lowering prescription drug prices: Trump invited Cummings to the White House, the two had a good meeting, and then Cummings heard the president publicly crediting Cummings with saying that Trump would âgo down as one of the great presidents.â (Cummings says his statement was surrounded by a lot of caveats and âifâ statements, none of which Trump has fulfilled). Itâs not just that the president obviously misrepresented him, Cummings said, and that his takeaway from the experience is, âI have to really be careful if I ever talk to him or meet with him, I have to have somebody present, to be a witness.â The bigger frustration is that he hasnât heard from the White House for close to a year about the prescription drug prices that Cummings says are costing people their livesâand which Trump said he cared about. Heâs particularly offended by the GOP approach to voting rights. Where are the Republicans willing to revise the Voting Rights Act, he asks, as the Supreme Court suggested Congress do in its decision striking down a key section of it in 2014? He thinks about his mother, who died in February at age 92, born a sharecropper in South Carolina, just like his father, and who came to still-segregated Baltimore in the 1940s looking for something better. âMy mother, on her dying bed, the last thing she said to me was, âDo not let them take away our right to vote.â And then she died. Why? Because she had seen the pain that people had gone through to get the vote, what it meant to see for her,â Cummings said. Heâs a collaborative person. He makes actual friendships across the aisle. He doesnât throw flames just for the sake of it. Not on this. âI donât see how somebody thereâa Republicanâcan go and say, âIâm your friend,ââ he said. âYouâre not my friend. How can you be my friend when you wonât even let me control my own destiny? How can you be my friend?â Still, Cummings said, he doesnât think heâll have a hard time working the balance between Democrats whoâll insist that no matter how many investigations he launches that heâs not doing enough, and Republicans whoâll insist that no matter how tight a grip he keeps on them, that heâs overreaching. âI tell my constituents, âWe are in a storm. Itâs a big storm. Itâs called the Trump storm,ââ Cummings said. ââThe question is not whether the storm will end, but âWhere will you be? What will you have? Will you be living when that storm ends?â Thatâs the question. So, in the meantime, weâve got to respect that storm and deal with it.â California By Jeremy B.

        "articles": "2020 elections All three states were once reliably Democratic in presidential elections. President Donald Trump. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images By CAITLIN OPRYSKO 02/20/2020 01:30 PM EST Updated: 02/20/2020 02:07 PM EST Link Copied President Donald Trump remains within striking distance of each of the top Democratic candidates in three critical Rust Belt swing states that solidified his 2016 victory, according to a new poll out Thursday. The Quinnipiac University poll found Trump leading the top Democratic candidates in head-to-head match ups in Wisconsin by between 7 and 11 percentage points among registered voters. But the poll found closer races in Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Democrats held a slight edge in each. All three states were once reliably Democratic in presidential elections, part of the so-called \"blue wall\" that crumbled in favor of Trump in 2016. The poll, conducted after last week's New Hampshire primary, comes at a time when the primary field remains extremely fluid with multiple candidates who claim to be best positioned to defeat the president in November. In Pennsylvania, a key swing state that Trump carried by just over 1 point in 2016, the president trails three of his potential Democratic opponents by at least 6 points. It found former Vice President Joe Biden leading Trump by 8 points, while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar holds a 7-point lead and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg leads Trump by 6 points. It found closer races between Trump and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Sanders and Buttigieg hold 4-point leads over Trump, while Warren’s 3-point lead falls within the survey’s margin of error. In Michigan, where only .3 percentage points separated Trump and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 contest, the survey shows the traditionally blue state remains in play in 2020 but foreshadows another nail biter. Sanders and Bloomberg, who both top Trump by 5 points, and Biden, who leads Trump by 4 points, are the only candidates whose lead falls outside of the margin of error in Michigan. Buttigieg and Klobuchar, candidates who have campaigned hard on their appeal to moderate and Midwestern voters, each lead the president by just 1 point in Michigan, the poll found. Thursday's survey offers a contrast with recent national polling that has typically shown the top Democrats with more of an advantage in head-to-head match ups in a hpothetical general election against the president. The most recent Quinnipiac poll of nationwide registered voters, for example, found the top Democrats beating Trump by anywhere from 4 to 9 points. \"Three different states, three different scenarios, one constant — the economy. It's a top issue for voters, and it's giving President Trump a strong tailwind,\" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Mary Snow said in a press release. \"Wisconsin voters give him a job approval rating above 50 percent, higher than what he receives nationally and in Pennsylvania and Michigan. These Wisconsin numbers are a red warning sign for Democrats that rebuilding the 'blue wall' in 2020 may not be so easy. But it's a long way to November.\" The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted from Feb. 12-18 via landline and cell phones among a sample size of 845 self-identified registered voters in Michigan, 849 self-identified registered voters in Pennsylvania and 823 self-identified registered voters in Wisconsin. Results from each state have a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points. The Quinnipiac survey did not include businessman Tom Steyer — who has trailed most of the Democratic field in national polls but is hoping to pull off strong performances in the next two nominating contests — in its head-to-head match ups.

        "articles": "2016 For better and for worse, Sanders made all the big decisions. By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE and GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI 06/07/2016 11:26 PM EDT Updated 06/08/2016 01:33 AM EDT Bernie Sanders and aides laugh at the idea that he’s damaging the party and hurting Hillary Clinton. | AP Photo There’s no strategist pulling the strings, and no collection of burn-it-all-down aides egging him on. At the heart of the rage against Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party, the campaign aides closest to him say, is Bernie Sanders. It was the Vermont senator who personally rewrote his campaign manager’s shorter statement after the chaos at the Nevada state party convention and blamed the political establishment for inciting the violence. He was the one who made the choice to go after Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz after his wife read him a transcript of her blasting him on television. He chose the knife fight over calling Clinton unqualified, which aides blame for pulling the bottom out of any hopes they had of winning in New York and their last real chance of turning a losing primary run around. And when Jimmy Kimmel’s producers asked Sanders’ campaign for a question to ask Donald Trump, Sanders himself wrote the one challenging the Republican nominee to a debate. There are many divisions within the Sanders campaign—between the dead-enders and the work-it-out crowds, between the younger aides who think he got off message while the consultants got rich and obsessed with Beltway-style superdelegate math, and between the more experienced staffers who think the kids got way too high on their sense of the difference between a movement and an actual campaign. But more than any of them, Sanders is himself filled with resentment, on edge, feeling like he gets no respect -- all while holding on in his head to the enticing but remote chance that Clinton may be indicted before the convention. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver, who’s been enjoying himself in near constant TV appearances, and the candidate’s wife Jane Sanders, are fully on board. But convinced since his surprise Michigan win that he could actually win the nomination, Sanders has been on email and the phone, directing elements of the campaign right down to his city-by-city schedule in California. He wants it. He thinks it should be his. “Bernie’s been at the helm of this campaign from the beginning,” said Weaver, “and the overall message of this campaign and the direction of the campaign and the strategy, has been driven by Bernie.” Convinced as Sanders is that he’s realizing his lifelong dream of being the catalyst for remaking American politics—aides say he takes credit for a Harvard Kennedy School study in April showing young people getting more liberal, and he takes personal offense every time Clinton just dismisses the possibility of picking him as her running mate—his guiding principle under attack has basically boiled down to a feeling that multiple aides sum up as: “Screw me? No, screw you.” Take the combative statement after the Nevada showdown. “I don’t know who advised him that this was the right route to take, but we are now actively destroying what Bernie worked so hard to build over the last year just to pick up two fucking delegates in a state he lost,” rapid response director Mike Casca complained to Weaver in an internal campaign email obtained by . “Thank you for your views. I’ll relay them to the senator, as he is driving this train,” Weaver wrote back. In the run-up to the California primary, the big strategic question was how much to modulate the tone of the letter to superdelegates that he's been preparing to send out Wednesday, building on the case that Sen. Jeff Merkley, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Sen. Paul Kirk and former Communication Workers of America president Larry Cohen have been making to fellow superdelegates over the phone for weeks about polls and other factors that would make Sanders the more competitive general election candidate. This isn’t about what’s good for the Democratic Party in his mind, but about what he thinks is good for advancing the agenda that he’s been pushing since before he got elected mayor of Burlington. Sanders owns nearly every major decision, right down to the bills. A conversation with former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin about getting left in personal debt from his own 1992 presidential campaign has stayed at the top of Sanders’ mind. He demanded that the campaign bank account never go under $10 million, even when that’s meant decisions Weaver and campaign architect Tad Devine have protested -- like making the call in the final days before Kentucky to go with digital director Kenneth Pennington’s plan to focus on data and field, instead of $300,000 to match Clinton on TV. Sanders ultimately lost there by just 1,924 votes. Sanders and aides laugh at the idea that he’s damaging the party and hurting Clinton. They think they don’t get enough gratitude for how much they held back, from not targeting more Democratic members of the House and Senate who opposed him to not making more of an issue out of Clinton’s email server investigation and Bill Clinton’s sex scandals, all of which they discussed as possible lines of attack in the fall. They blame Clinton going after him on gun control for goading him into letting loose on her Goldman Sachs speeches. “If they hadn’t started at it by really going hard at him on guns, raising a series of issues against him, that really was what led to him being much, much more aggressive than he otherwise would have been,” said Devine, the consultant who helped engineer Sanders’ plans for a protest candidacy into a real campaign (and convinced him to run as a Democrat). Since he finished approving the ads for California not long after the Kentucky strategy spat, Devine has been back home in Rhode Island, noticeably missing from cable news as a surrogate but still regularly in touch with Sanders. Devine, who’s been more anxious about what an endgame looks like, says he hasn’t heard anything from the senator that suggests he would alter his plans because of the Clinton campaign’s eagerness to have President Barack Obama endorse her and declare the primaries done. “They would be very smart to understand that the best way to approach Bernie is not to try to push him around,” Devine said. “It’s much better if they try to cooperate with him and find common ground. They should be mindful of the fact that the people he’s brought into this process are new to it and they will be very suspicious of any effort to push him around.” Aides say Sanders thinks that progressives who picked Clinton are cynical, power-chasing chickens — like Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of his most consistent allies in the Senate before endorsing Clinton and campaigning hard for her ahead of the Ohio primary. Sanders is so bitter about it that he’d be ready to nix Brown as an acceptable VP choice, if Clinton ever asked his advice on who’d be a good progressive champion. * * * Every time Sanders got into a knife fight, aides say, they ended up losing. But they could never stop Sanders when he got his back up. Coming off walloping Clinton in the Wisconsin primary in April, the first internal numbers from campaign pollster Ben Tulchin showed Sanders within range in New York’s pivotal contest two weeks later. Though some senior aides say they realize now the dynamics of the state and the closed primary meant they never really had a shot, they also blame coverage of his New York Daily News interview and the blowup over calling Clinton “not qualified” for taking New York off the table. Losing Pennsylvania the following week was another body blow, one of four losses in five states that night. In the days following, before Sanders scored his win in Indiana that campaign aides feel no one acknowledged because it came the same night Trump locked up the Republican nomination, the calls started coming in from Democratic power brokers. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid’s call was part advice, part asking a favor, urging Sanders to use his now massive email list to help Democratic Senate candidates. Russ Feingold in Wisconsin was the most obvious prospect, and Reid wanted to make introductions to Iowa’s Patty Judge and North Carolina’s Deborah Ross—to help Democrats win the majority, but also to give Sanders allies in making himself the leader of the Senate progressives come next year. Reid, according to people familiar with the conversation, ended the discussion thinking Sanders was on board. He backed Feingold. But that’s the last anyone heard. Word got back to Reid’s team that Weaver had nixed the idea, ruling out backing anyone who hadn’t endorsed Sanders. Weaver says it’s because the Senate hopefuls had to get in line for Sanders’ support behind top backers like Gabbard and Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.)—though neither has a competitive race this year. Sanders never followed up himself. Just before they all figured they’d see each other at the White House Correspondents Dinner, a call from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta came in to Devine, who’s seen by most in the Clinton camp as the only senior aide to Sanders whom Clinton’s staff feels is actually open to a conversation, though Weaver and Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook have checked in with each other occasionally as well. “I’m ready to talk,” Podesta said, though, “I don’t have a peace pipe or anything.” Devine brought the idea to Sanders. “Do you trust him?” Sanders said, people familiar with the conversation said. “Yeah, I do,” Devine said. “You think we should talk to him?” Sanders asked. “I think we should try to win California, and then we’ll talk to him,” Devine said. In an interview with NBC News’ Lester Holt on Tuesday, Bernie Sanders held firmly that he will continue to lobby superdelegates. Reaching out to the Trump campaign was a different story. Devine knows campaign chairman Paul Manafort from, among other things, their collaboration on the campaign of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. According to campaign aides, the morning after Trump was on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Weaver asked Devine to give Manafort a call to see if they could actually make the debate happen. They were already fielding offers from most of the networks—including a producer for Stephen Colbert, who wanted to host the debate on his own late night show. Manafort laughed, said it was a joke, but then again, Trump was on his plane, and he had no idea what the candidate would do. The answer turned out to be a statement killing the speculation. Manafort left a voicemail for Devine saying he’d won over Trump. Devine never called him back. * * * Top Sanders aides admit that it’s been weeks, if not months, since they themselves realized he wasn’t going to win, and they’ve been operating with a Trump’s-got-no-real-shot safety net. They debate whether Sanders’ role in the fall should be a full vote-for-Clinton campaign, or whether he should just campaign hard against Trump without signing up to do much for her directly. They haven’t been able to get Sanders focused on any of that, or on the real questions about what kind of long term organization to build out of his email list. They know they’ll have their own rally in Philadelphia – outside the the convention hall—but that’s about as far as they’ve gotten. “He wants to be in the race until the end, until the roll call vote,” Weaver said. Aides say they’re going to discourage people from booing Wasserman Schultz, who’s emerged as public enemy number one among Sanders supporters, when she takes the stage at the convention. But they think it’s going to happen anyway. Meanwhile, they’re looking into trying to replace the Florida congresswoman as the convention chair with Gabbard, and forceWasserman Schultz to resign as DNC chair the day after the convention. By DANIEL STRAUSS The meetings in Philadelphia have already started, with the platform drafting committee set to have its opening session on Wednesday. The Sanders team is headed by Mark Longabaugh—Devine’s business partner, but who’s veered closer to Weaver when it comes to eagerness to headbutt. There are negotiations with the Clinton campaign and the DNC over what they’re going to force them to agree to, from speaking slots at the convention to long-term control over party operations to the order of early state voting (Aides say Sanders believes the race would have been radically different if the order were different, and more states were by themselves on the calendar instead of lumped together on super-ish Tuesdays). “Everything is on the table,” Longabaugh said. There’s also the issue of payback. Campaign aides say that whatever else happens, Sanders wants former Congressman Barney Frank and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy out of their spots as co-chairs of the convention rules committee. It’s become a priority fight for him. Sanders, the aides say, believes Frank has hated him for years, but the former Massachusetts congressman’s calling him a “McCarthyite” pushed him over the edge. He never really registered who Malloy was, despite his being from a neighboring home state and his status as one of the most liberal governors in the country, but Sanders was enraged to hear the governor say he had blood on his hands for not supporting the gun manufacturer liability law. Aides think Democrats should be grateful that he’s increased voter turnout and registration. And it’s why they assume Clinton’s campaign will humbly request he be her college campus and millennial ambassador through the fall, to keep up the rallies and the voter registration that’s given him the 45 percent of primary voters. “When they say we’re hurting the Democratic Party,” Devine said, “we believe we’re helping it.” That’s because Sanders is a savvier politician than almost anyone’s given him credit for. He likes that he’s been in front of almost a million people since the campaign started. But he knows that as soon as the campaign’s done, the crowds will start thinning, and he’s not going to get on television anymore. He’s certainly not running for president again. Sanders knows the ride is about to stop—but he’s going to push it as far as he can before it does. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "2016 Brooklyn is being hassled by veterans of past Clinton campaigns over strategy and resources in the first primary state. By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI 10/06/2015 05:06 AM EDT Getty MANCHESTER, N.H. — Hillary Clinton is losing in New Hampshire, and at least one small contingent of family allies thinks it’s nearly time to cut bait. The group — veterans of the family’s old campaigns and people close to Clinton’s fundraising — see little reason to support a strategy that continues to pour resources into the state where Bernie Sanders’ already surprising lead shows no signs of shrinking. Despite confidence emanating from the campaign’s paid leadership team that Clinton is well positioned with more than four months to go before the primary, this circle of informal advisers is whispering about more aggressively looking beyond New Hampshire after a summer that saw her polling advantage evaporate. These confidantes are not only granting the possibility that Sanders could win here: they see it as a near-certainty, and in some cases wonder about the usefulness of flooding the state with precious resources. Instead, they’re arguing that Clinton’s campaign would be just fine focusing on the states that follow in early 2016. “I look at New Hampshire and I say, ‘um, yeah, whatever.’ I like the people in Iowa. I like the people in New Hampshire. But you know what? They are distinctly different than most places in the country are. They are very white, they are very parochial. And they are not emblematic of the country,” explained one Washington-based Clinton friend who remains in touch with the candidate, adding that she would be comfortable relying on the campaign’s organization in the 48 other states. Trade By VICTORIA GUIDA “It’s about preserving the antique nomination process. I don’t know if I care so much. I’d like to win. But I don’t think it’s crucial, nor do I think it’s necessary, to win either of those two states.\" The widening rift between Clinton’s team and the pocket of informal but influential advisers and old friends is quiet, but real. And it’s exactly this kind of off-strategy, off-message suggestion that drives the official Brooklyn-based campaign mad. That’s because Clinton’s political team readily acknowledges her weakness in New Hampshire — she was down 14 points to Sanders by the end of September in the Huffington Post Pollster average. And the team is also well aware of the circumstances that the doubters see as evidence of a lost cause — Sanders’ next-door neighbor status, voters’ perceived inability to break into Clinton’s Secret-Service mandated bubble, and her own role as the establishment’s front-runner. But to Clinton staffers in both Brooklyn and Manchester, the idea of shifting away from New Hampshire — the state that resuscitated Clinton’s 2008 campaign and her husband’s 1992 effort — is beyond ridiculous, and potentially campaign-killing. The state couldn’t be further from hopeless, they say. “New Hampshire is doing its important work, which is having the candidates do all the critical work that needs to be done to earn the vote,” said Clinton’s New Hampshire state director, Mike Vlacich, who dismissed the suggestion that pulling back would even be remotely considered. “We set out from the very beginning understanding that we would have a challenge, and that we would have to work hard to meet that challenge.\" Clinton’s team acknowledges they’ve heard rumblings of discontent from old family hands, but the schism hasn’t broken into the open. Instead, it’s an illustration of the campaign’s struggle to keep its enormous network of Democrats on message as it fends off Sanders’ surprisingly resilient challenge. By NICK GASS Clinton has poured millions of dollars into the state to pay for television advertising and its 50 in-state staffers, and the candidate spends as much time in New Hampshire — where she was on Monday — as any other state besides Iowa — where she’ll be on Tuesday. So her backers on the ground here are growing frustrated with such hand-wringing from the sidelines, saying that Clinton’s demonstrated investment — combined with the fact that New Hampshire Democrats have tended to change their minds late in the race in recent cycles — should be enough to calm the nervous. “I wish that the squishy types in Washington would call us,” said former New Hampshire Democratic Party chairwoman Kathy Sullivan, a Clinton supporter. “To make a determination of what the outcome is going to be in early February, based on a few polls right now? That’s craziness.\" Accordingly, Clinton’s team sees the summer as a weak period, but more of a phase than a harbinger. While Sanders’ own paid staff of 43 tries to move past the work-in-progress phase it has reached in the eyes of neutral Democrats, the former secretary of state’s own team keeps in mind the primary’s recent history — late-stage favorites losing in the last three contested races. And while the skeptical contingent sees Sanders’ profile as reason to consider writing the state off, the official side simply sees it as a good way to explain his polling lead, which they say has plateaued. “There’s not a lot of anxiety over [Sanders]’ lead,” said a close Clinton ally with no formal ties to the campaign, but who still speaks with the candidate and raises money for her. “We’d obviously love to win New Hampshire, [but] he’s the perfect candidate for New Hampshire.\" That calculation is reversed among paid Clintonites. New Hampshire’s exceedingly white demographic makeup, increasingly liberal population, and history of loving insurgents — particularly those from next-door states — make Sanders formidable, they acknowledge. But, that he’s only up by 14 points after a summer of fawning headlines about his crowd sizes while Clinton struggled to answer her email questions suggests, her team says, that there’s room for her to storm back. “This is not the first time we’ve seen this dynamic in the New Hampshire primary,” said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire’s Survey Center. \"There’s 40-to-45 percent of the Democratic primary voters who, time after time, want to be swept off their feet by somebody other than the front-runner. This goes back to Gene McCarthy.\" And while no candidate from a neighbor state has lost the primary in recent years (except Vermonter Howard Dean, who lost to Massachusetts’ John Kerry), Clinton backers note that relatively few voters live in areas of overlap with Vermont media markets, so it’s not like Sanders was already a state-wide celebrity. By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI Still, part of Sanders’ lead can be attributed to the goodwill and name recognition he generated by campaigning for New Hampshire Democrats in recent years, said his state director Julia Barnes. Clinton only came north for one event in the 2014 election cycle, and her party establishment support — including endorsements from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Gov. Maggie Hassan — hasn’t been enough to make up that difference. Even Clinton herself pointed to Sanders’ geographical proximity on Monday morning when asked about his strength in the state. “Frankly, I think we’ve out-campaigned Hillary Clinton,” said senior Sanders strategist Mark Longabaugh, who ran New Hampshire operations for Dick Gephardt in 1988 and Bill Bradley in 2000. “In a lot of other states there’s a more institutional and organizational structure in Democratic parties, and that’s not the case here. … No disrespect to Shaheen or the current governor, but they don’t have powerful, patronage-driven infrastructure.\" So this local advantage is yet another reason some of the skeptics say Clinton would be better served looking straight to the southern states that make up Super Tuesday — states her campaign is already organizing. The official side is keeping a happy face on its deficit for the moment, pointing to recent history as its guide. “I would rather not be the person with a commanding lead right now, because in New Hampshire that usually leads to heartbreak,” said Sullivan. Or, in the words of Clinton friend and fundraiser Robert Zimmerman, who went a step further: “The only thing worse than being in second in New Hampshire and Iowa at this stage is being in first.\" Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "The lobbying push by Sen. Mitch McConnell’s former staffers comes as he is being criticized for blocking election security bills in the wake of Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign. | Win McNamee/Getty Images congress Democrats are pushing the Trump administration to review the project, and they say McConnell indirectly helped facilitate it. By NATASHA BERTRAND and THEODORIC MEYER 07/31/2019 02:00 PM EDT Updated 08/01/2019 11:25 AM EDT Two former top staffers to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have lobbied Congress and the Treasury Department on the development of a new Kentucky aluminum mill backed by the Russian aluminum giant Rusal, according to a new lobbying disclosure. The disclosure comes as Democrats are pushing the Trump administration to review Rusal’s $200 million investment in the Kentucky project — concerned that the mill will supply the Defense Department — and as McConnell weathers criticism for helping block a congressional effort to stop the investment. The Russian firm was only able to make the investment after it won sanctions relief from penalties the Treasury Department initially imposed in April 2018 on Rusal and other companies owned by Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch and Kremlin ally accused of facilitating Moscow’s nefarious activities, such as seizing land in Ukraine, supplying arms for the Syrian regime and meddling in other countries’ elections. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced in December that the department would lift the sanctions on Deripaska's companies, which had roiled global aluminum markets, if the oligarch agreed to drastically reduce his stake in the businesses. The deal was reportedly potentially beneficial to Deripaska, however. Deripaska himself still remains under U.S. sanctions. Attention over the sanctions relief deal has focused on McConnell, given his role in halting a bipartisan congressional effort in January to stop the penalties rollback. McConnell told reporters in May that his support for lifting the sanctions was “completely unrelated to anything that might happen in my home state.” “A number of us supported the administration,” McConnell said. “That position ended up prevailing. I think the administration made a recommendation without political consideration. And that’s — that was how I voted — the reason I voted the way I did.” Intelligence and analysis on lobbying — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, has been pushing the the administration to review the Rusal investment. In a statement, Wyden said: “Rusal’s proposed investment in a Kentucky rolling mill is deeply concerning. The deal was announced just three months after the Senate voted to lift sanctions on Rusal, and now we learn that Majority Leader McConnell’s former staff have been lobbying for the project. The American people need to have confidence that this deal is in the country’s best interest.” It’s unclear whether the former staffers — Hunter Bates, a former McConnell chief of staff, and Brendan Dunn, who advised the Kentucky Republican on tax, trade and financial services matters before heading to K Street last year — directly lobbied McConnell’s office over the aluminum mill project. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, the law and lobbying firm where Bates and Dunn work, and McConnell’s office declined to comment on whether they had done so. In Washington, it’s common for congressional staffers to lobby their former colleagues. Former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), who’s now a lobbyist representing Rusal’s parent company, EN+ Group, gave McConnell “a heads up” on the Rusal deal prior to its announcement, according to a disclosure filing first spotted by The New York Times. The lobbying push by McConnell’s former staffers, one of whom left his office in 2002 and the other who left a year ago, also comes as McConnell is being criticized for blocking election-security bills in the wake of Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. McConnell took to the Senate floor earlier this week to rebut accusations that he’s kowtowing to Russia, prompting the hashtag #MoscowMitch to begin trending on Twitter. The lobbying disclosure, made last week, shows Bates, Dunn and three other Akin Gump lobbyists are working for Braidy Industries in the new Ashland, Ky., aluminum mill. Rusal holds a 40 percent stake in the project. Democratic lawmakers have called for an investigation of the project by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency body that can recommend the cancellation of foreign financial arrangements with U.S. firms over national security concerns. A spokesman for Braidy told  in a statement that the company “has never negotiated or signed any contract to supply aluminum to the U.S. Government, including the DOD,” and noted that Braidy first “engaged” Akin Gump on May 20, months after the decision to lift the sanctions was made. “We are thankful for the support provided by Rusal, the world’s second largest aluminum company and largest supplier of low-carbon aluminum,” the spokesman added. “Leading the rebuild of Appalachia is not easy. Unemployed coal miners, steel workers, and railroad workers in Appalachia need new advanced manufacturing jobs.” CORRECTION: This report has been updated to accurately reflect that Hunter Bates was McConnell’s chief of staff and chief counsel from 1997-2002, before joining Akin Gump in 2016.

        "articles": "2020 Elections Still the reluctant leader of the Democratic Party, Obama has been providing counsel to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and other presidential hopefuls. By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE 06/11/2018 05:02 AM EDT Former President Barack Obama so far has avoided direct conflict with President Donald Trump, but that doesn't mean he's not looking toward 2020. | Yana Paskova/Getty Images Barack Obama has in recent months met with at least nine prospective 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Deval Patrick, pulling them in for one-on-one sessions at his Washington office. All the meetings were arranged quietly, without even some close advisers to the people involved being told of the conversations, in part because of how much Obama bristles at his private meetings becoming public knowledge. All have been confirmed to  by multiple people who have been briefed on the secretive sit-downs. The meetings have been at Obama’s personal office on the third floor of the World Wildlife Fund building in D.C.’s West End neighborhood, and they show how a stream of ambitious, searching politicians are looking for guidance and support from the man who has remained the reluctant leader of the Democratic Party, eager to be involved, though not directly. He's not making any promises of support, though, and is not expected to endorse in the 2020 race until after a nominee has emerged. Obama so far has avoided direct conflict with President Donald Trump — save for a few public statements criticizing his moves attempting to dismantle the Iran nuclear deal, Obamacare and the protection program for Dreamers, though without naming Trump. But Obama is concerned about how his own party is responding, and how it can be best positioned to win in the midterms and in the next presidential cycle to beat back the president and his politics.

He doesn’t see himself as the person to come up with the plan, people who know about the meetings say, but he is eager to be a sounding board and counselor to the Democrats he sees as playing a role in shaping the party’s future. Obama’s office declined comment on all the meetings. Sanders, who has more respect for Obama and the work of his administration than is often portrayed, requested his meeting with the former president, held in mid-March, people told about that conversation confirmed. They talked about the future of the party and their different roles in it. They talked about what the party should be focused on, and what would be distractions. Obama discussed his views on the differences between idealism and practicality, and Sanders responded with his. They did not get into a specific discussion about whether Sanders would run again for president in 2020. The meeting with Warren was Obama’s second since leaving office, according to people who know about both encounters. The first was in the spring of 2017 after Warren said she was “troubled” by the $400,000 Obama was getting to speak at a Wall Street investment firm, describing it as an example of the influence of money that she called “a snake that slithers through Washington.” Obama responded by inviting her in. They heard each other out. She did not apologize, but she acknowledged what she’d kicked up with the comment, and they talked about keeping that conversation in mind for the future. The second meeting, warmer from start to finish, came just this past April and ran well into 90 minutes. They talked about Richard Cordray, the former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who is now the Democratic nominee for governor in Ohio. They reminisced. They talked about Trump. Obama and Biden remain personally close and speak by phone, and the former vice president also came by for an in-person meeting in January. He’s waiting until after the midterms to make a decision on 2020, though many people see him as leaning toward it. The 2020 race and what Biden’s going to do haven’t come up in those discussions, though, with Obama waiting on his friend to make a decision, according to people who have been briefed on their conversations. Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor and personal friend whom Obama and many in his inner circle are eager to see get into the 2020 race — and who has recently been making rumblings that he very well might — has been in to the office too. Patrick, though, is on the board of the Obama Foundation, giving them at least an outward reason for the meeting beyond politics. Elections By ALEX ISENSTADT “The president was generous with his time and advice, and he was excited to talk about the future,” said one person familiar with one of the meetings. Many of the conversations have circled around Obama holding forth about how much Democrats should be heading into the midterms talking about the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election versus focusing on kitchen table issues. Don’t chase the shiny objects, he tells them. Don’t hyperventilate over the flash of any tweet. Think about what’s going to stick in the long term. This has all happened against the backdrop of Obama’s continuing work on his memoir, which he fell behind schedule on writing and for which he does not yet have a release date. He’s also been doing major fundraising for his foundation, and building out a stronger sense of what sort of programs it should have to fulfill his vision of it as a social organizing engine for creating more good in the world. And he’s continued to make those very well-paid speeches. On the road and over the phone, major donors and other panicked Democrats have been pushing him to take on a bigger public role in the fight against Trump. He has demurred on that — for now — keeping to his plan of waiting until the fall to begin making endorsements and campaign appearances. In private, it’s a different story. He’s urged donors to contribute to the Democratic National Committee. And he’s been eager to bring in many of the people he sees as key players in grappling with the crisis the party is in, as well as leading it to whatever comes next. His staff is building out his plan to start endorsing and hitting the campaign trail in the fall, with an emphasis on down-ballot races. Meanwhile, people who have been told about other meetings confirmed that they’re going on with some of the lesser known potential 2020 candidates, too. Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor being urged to run for president — including by some Obama alumni — sat with the former president in the fall. Jason Kander, the failed 2016 Missouri Senate candidate who’s looking at making an against-all-odds White House run, stopped by in January. And Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who’s thinking of a run of his own, was in to see Obama at the end of last year. Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles and one of the early supporters of Obama’s 2008 campaign, hasn’t been to the Washington office, but he got his private meeting when Obama was in town to attend a dinner in May for the American Constitution Center, say several people who were told of that meeting. By DAVID SIDERS According to multiple people familiar with them, the meetings run long, often over an hour. Obama tends to give advice, guidance, talk about the future of the party, and everyone’s places in it. The conversations can be searching, get philosophical, then quickly veer back to brass tacks. He’ll give his thoughts on campaigns. He’ll offer to help make sure donors and party bigwigs are returning calls. The people in them walk out appreciative but tight-lipped. They worry that if word gets out, Obama might renege on his offers to help and not invite them again if they do. Among the other speculated 2020 candidates who haven’t been through: Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Terry McAuliffe. Cory Booker was in to see Obama last year, shortly after he returned from his extended post-White House vacation, but hasn’t been back since. But run-ins like that one are among the ways that the meetings get started. Obama sees a future-minded Democrat he’s interested in getting to know more and tells them vaguely that they should come by to see him. And they are eager to. It’s not just prospective presidential candidates, according to people aware of other meetings. Harry Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader, stopped by while on a trip through town at the end of March. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has urged Obama over the phone to see massive fundraising as the best way he can help Senate Democrats in 2018. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has also been on the phone with Obama, urging him toward fundraising — and he’s now scheduled to do a fundraising event for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on June 29 in the Bay Area. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez also continues to check in. Other senators have been by as well, including Colorado’s Michael Bennet, Delaware’s Chris Coons and Alabama’s Doug Jones, according to people familiar with those meetings. “As a former senator and president, it was a privilege to meet with him and hear his perspectives and advice on leadership, separate and apart from any politics,” said Jones, who pointed out that he also met with Trump and is hoping to meet with George W. Bush. Obama’s also met with Eric Holder to talk about the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, but the chatter that the former attorney general has kept going about how he might actually run for president himself hasn’t been at the forefront of those conversations, said people told about those conversations. “I think it’s great that he’s meeting with people who are interested in the future of the country and the party,” said a person familiar with another one of the meetings.

        "articles": "Allan Lichtman reached meme-status last fall for predicting Donald Trump would win long before anyone else. | AP Photo By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE 04/13/2017 05:17 AM EDT The professor who took hell for predicting President Donald Trump has a much longer case for predicting President Mike Pence — and it’s all in his new book, out next week. Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University, reached meme-status last fall for predicting long before anyone else that Trump would win, using a formula based on the popularity of the party in control of the White House that accurately predicted the eight previous presidential elections. Now Lichtman wants everyone to pay attention to the rest of what came through his crystal ball — that Trump will now be impeached. The people who paid attention only to the professor’s first prediction include the commander in chief, whom Lichtman says reached out to him during the transition. “Taking time out of preparing to become the world’s most powerful leader, he wrote me a personal note, saying ‘Professor — Congrats — good call,’” Lichtman writes in “The Case for Impeachment,” an advance copy of which was shared with . “What Trump overlooked, however, was my ‘next big prediction’: that, after winning the presidency, he would be impeached.” Lichtman is clearly no Trump fan, writing at length about his discomfort with Trump’s opposition to the Paris Climate accord. He refers to Trump’s travel ban as “dimming the torch of liberty” and heads one section of the book, “Trump’s policies and appointments pose an existential threat to humanity.” White House By MATTHEW NUSSBAUM The book, rushed to the presses after the election, provides a brief history of the thinking that led the Framers to include impeachment, and the behavior that led presidents to get impeached — counting Richard Nixon along with Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton (the two presidents who didn’t resign before the Articles of Impeachment were read in the House), Lichtman points out that one out of every 14 presidents has been impeached: “gamblers have become rich betting on longer odds than that.” With a heavy hmm, he cites Johnson's obituary in The New York Times, which said the 17th president's fatal flaw was \"he was always headstrong, 'sure he was right' even in his errors.\" Several Democrats have predicted that the first thing they’d do if they win the House next year is impeach Trump. It may not take that long, Lichtman argues, writing that his book is meant to “explain how Trump threatens the institutions and traditions that have made America safe and free for 230 years, and I’ll make clear why a Republican Congress might impeach a president of its own party.” Lichtman’s list of possible offenses that could get Trump to that point are familiar: charges of treason with Russia, abuse of power and emoluments violations. Lichtman also cites now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, then a senator, who argued that a president could be impeached for offenses committed before he took office. Among those potential offenses, Lichtman lists Trump’s housing violations, charity problems, potential violations of the Cuba embargo and Trump University. It’s all part of a brief — designed to be damning — tour through Trump’s history. It includes section headings like “Trump Towers Become Vacant Lots” and “Lying His Way to the Presidency.” It eventually leads Lichtman to the conclusion that Trump might serve himself up for impeachment: “Trump’s disregard for lying in sworn testimony, examined in the context of the Bill Clinton precedent, shows how Trump’s opponents could set an impeachment trap for him through a civil lawsuit.” Get breaking news when it happens — in your inbox.

Imagine, Lichtman writes, if Trump gets Congress to lift sanctions against Russia by lying about some promise made by Vladimir Putin, or shakes the economy by lying about Bureau of Labor Statistics employment numbers. Lichtman’s advice to Trump to avoid his prediction is a checklist that includes divesting, supporting the Paris Climate accord, using a fact-checker and treating women with respect. He also dares Trump to “add a shrink to the White House physicians.” “Opponents will challenge your decision-making abilities and claim that they were right all along about your temperamental unfitness for the presidency, yet you have survived and thrived by defying the conventional political wisdom. Why not do it again?” He also encourages Trump to “curb the Mussolini act” and fire chief strategist Steve Bannon. President Andrew Johnson “showed how an impeachment and trial could benefit the nation,” Lichtman writes at one point. And he’s clearly rooting for that to happen now. “Justice will be realized in today’s America not through revolution, but by the Constitution’s peaceful remedy of impeachment,” he concludes the book, “but only if the people demand it.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "2020 elections The president asserts that large numbers of mail-in ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic might mean “you never even know who won the election.” By QUINT FORGEY, ZACH MONTELLARO and CAITLIN OPRYSKO 07/30/2020 09:27 AM EDT Updated: 07/30/2020 07:27 PM EDT Link Copied President Donald Trump on Thursday refused to back down from his suggestion earlier in the day that the November general election be postponed, repeating unsubstantiated predictions of widespread voter fraud amid the coronavirus pandemic and saying that large numbers of mail-in ballots might mean “you never even know who won the election.” The president’s extraordinary proposal, which he is not constitutionally empowered to enforce, represented his first attempt at floating a suspension of the election less than 100 days away. “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history,” Trump wrote on Twitter in the morning. “It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???” Hours later, he appeared to launch a partial clean-up of the suggestion after it was roundly rejected by members of his own party. “Glad I was able to get the very dishonest LameStream Media to finally start talking about the RISKS to our Democracy from dangerous Universal Mail-In-Voting” Trump said Thursday afternoon, reiterating that he “totally” supports absentee voting. The president added that in his view it was imperative to find out who won the election on election night, “not days, months, or even years later,” as some election experts have indeed warned that a drastic surge in mail-in ballots might mean a close race isn’t called on the evening of Nov. 3. He also vowed that he would win the 2020 election, despite recent polling suggesting trouble for the president. He reiterated those views in a coronavirus briefing at the White House later, ignoring multiple opportunities to walk back his proposal but insisting that he didn’t want to see the election delayed. “Do I want to see a day change? No. But I don’t want to see a crooked election,” he told reporters, asserting without evidence that a 2020 election in which large swaths of voters cast their ballots by mail would be “the most rigged election in history.” “I don't want to see an election — you know, so many years I've been watching elections,” Trump added. “And they say the projected winner or the winner of the election. I don't want to see that take place in a week after Nov. 3 or a month or, frankly, with litigation and everything else that could happen, in years, years, or you never even know who won the election.” President Donald Trump and Melania Trump have tested positive for Covid-19. Virtually all public polling of the White House race shows Trump trailing by significant margins nationally and in battleground states, and his initial tweet Thursday morning came minutes after the Commerce Department reported that the pandemic had inflicted the worst economic contraction in modern American history. As the Covid-19 outbreak in the United States has worsened in recent months, prominent Democrats have cautioned that the president might seek to seize upon the public health crisis to question the legitimacy of the election or even defy its results. “Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held,” former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in April. Trump rejected Biden’s warning days later at a news briefing conducted by the White House coronavirus task force. “I never even thought of changing the date of the election,” he said. “Why would I do that? November 3rd. It’s a good number. No, I look forward to that election.” Trump’s reelection team was similarly dismissive at the time of Biden’s remarks. “Those are the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality,” Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director, said in a statement. Matt Wolking, the Trump campaign’s deputy communications director, tweeted at the time: “Joe Biden’s conspiracy theory is irresponsible and has no basis in reality.” The president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, generated controversy in May when he said he was unsure whether he could “commit one way or the other” to holding the election as scheduled. Kushner sought to clarify his comments hours later, saying he had not been involved in and was unaware of “any discussions about trying to change the date of the presidential election.” Biden has argued that while the coronavirus might force changes to the way voting is conducted, the election should not be delayed. “I’d much prefer to have on — you know, in-person voting, but it depends. It depends on the state of play,” he said in April. “But we cannot, we cannot delay or postpone a constitutionally required November election.” The date for the presidential election has been set in law by Congress since 1845 as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. In a statement provided Thursday to , Hogan Gidley, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, said the president’s tweet was “just raising a question about the chaos Democrats have created with their insistence on all mail-in voting.” “They are using coronavirus as their means to try to institute universal mail-in voting, which means sending every registered voter a ballot whether they asked for one or not,” Gidley said, adding that “universal mail-in voting invites chaos and severe delays in results.” The Trump campaign has sought to draw a distinction between universal mail-in voting and absentee voting, similar to how the president did in his tweet Thursday. Justin Clark, Trump’s deputy campaign manager, told  earlier this month that Democrats were working to sow confusion ahead of the election and fundamentally change the process by which the country votes. “Contrary to what some in the media and on the left claim, there are significant differences between absentee voting and universal vote-by-mail,” Clark said in a statement. “If a voter can’t make it to the polls, they can request an absentee ballot,” he said, repeating his claims about fraud affecting “100% vote-by-mail” elections. However, the president often muddles the two terms, and the Trump campaign has refused to clarify his positions on voting by mail. The Trump campaign did not answer a list of specific questions from  earlier this month, instead providing only Clark’s statement.  asked whether the president supports no-excuse absentee voting, or whether he thinks all voters should have a valid excuse to vote absentee. The majority of states allow for no-excuse absentee voting, meaning anyone can request an absentee ballot.  also asked whether the president still opposed mailing out absentee ballot request forms, not the ballots themselves, after criticizing such a policy in Michigan. Trump has tweeted that absentee ballots “are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens, military, and others who can’t get to the polls on Election Day.” He deemed them to be “fine” because “a person has to go through a process to get and use them.” Voting rights experts say there is no difference between the terms mail-in voting and absentee voting, and some jurisdictions such as Florida have scrubbed the latter term to avoid confusion among voters. Republicans have actively promoted requesting absentee ballots in no-excuse states, including Pennsylvania and Florida. In November, 42 states and the District of Columbia will effectively allow for, at a minimum, no-excuse absentee balloting — meaning any voter, regardless of age, health or location on Election Day will be able to vote by mail should they choose to do so. Of those states, just seven are planning to proactively mail every voter a ballot. Five do it as a regular course — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington — while California and Vermont, along with the District of Columbia, have announced their intention to do so because of the pandemic. An analysis last month of voting in three of those states that send ballots routinely found that officials identified an infinitesimal amount of potentially fraudulent ballots. House Democrats did pass a bill in May that would mandate all voters be sent a ballot in the case of an emergency, along with other sweeping changes to the American electoral system. But the legislation faces ardent opposition from Senate Republicans, and it is exceedingly unlikely to become law. The remaining eight states, including the large states of Texas and New York, require a valid excuse for a voter to request an absentee ballot for November. Despite the president’s repeated insistence to the contrary, cases of election fraud in the U.S. are exceedingly rare. Experts acknowledge that there are some slightly higher fraud risks associated with mail-in balloting when proper security measures are not put in place. Beyond his allegations of potential voter fraud, Trump has also claimed that mail-in voting would yield unfavorable electoral results for the Republican Party. Nonetheless, GOP political operatives have embraced vote-by-mail, and a recent study found that it does not benefit one party over another. Roughly 57.2 million Americans participated in the 2016 election via early, absentee or mail-in voting, including active duty military who live either overseas or in the U.S. outside their home voting jurisdiction. That total represented 2 in 5 of all ballots cast. Trump voted by mail in Florida’s primary in March, and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has repeatedly voted in Florida while out of state — including when she worked in Washington and had a New Jersey driver’s license that indicated she was not a Florida resident. Still, at the White House on Thursday Trump claimed that conducting an election heavy in mail-in ballots would be “very unfair” to the country, and that doing so would make the U.S. “a laughingstock all over the world.” He also accused his opponents of trying to conceal what he asserted was rampant fraud for mail-in ballots. “That’s common sense,” he asserted. “Everyone knows it. Smart people know it. Stupid people may not know it. And some people don’t want to talk about it. But they know it.” He skirted a question about whether he intended the “net effect” of his comments to cast doubt on the results of the November election, contending that his comments “had a tremendous impact” and had provoked Americans to look more closely at voting by mail. The president’s accusations of voter fraud extend back to the 2016 election and do not apply exclusively to voting by mail. During his previous campaign for the White House, Trump promoted various theories preemptively casting doubt on the results of the “rigged” election, including his claim that 1.8 million dead people “are registered to vote, and some of them absolutely vote.” After he was elected in November 2016, Trump claimed without evidence that millions of people voting illegally cost him the popular vote. And in 2018, he disbanded a controversial commission that was charged with investigating his unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud during the election. His comments on Thursday earned him nearly universal condemnation, even among his top allies in the Republican Party. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who as president pro tempore of the Senate is in the line of succession for the presidency, dismissed Trump’s tweet as the president’s own personal opinion and pointed out that it would take an act of Congress to change the date of a federal election. “It doesn’t matter what one individual in this country says,” Grassley said. “We still are a country based on the rule of law. And we must follow the law until either the Constitution is changed or until the law is changed.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) also pushed back on Trump. “No way should we ever not hold an election on the day that we have it,” McCarthy told reporters. At least one ally and defender of the president, Federalist Society co-founder Steven Calabresi, used Trump’s tweet to call for his removal from office. “I am frankly appalled by the president’s recent tweet seeking to postpone the November election,” Calabresi wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times. “Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats’ assertion that President Trump is a fascist,” he continued. “But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again by the House of Representatives and his removal from office by the Senate.” Link Copied © 2021  LLC",

Two sources close to the president said people in Trump’s inner circle have in recent days been actively discussing the possibility that Michael Cohen — long seen as one of Trump’s most loyal personal allies — might flip if he faces serious charges as a result of his work on behalf of Trump. “That’s what they’ll threaten him with: life imprisonment,” said Alan Dershowitz, the liberal lawyer and frequent Trump defender who met with the president and his staff over two days at the White House last week. “They’re going to threaten him with a long prison term and try to turn him into a canary that sings.” FBI agents overseen by federal prosecutors in New York last week raided Cohen’s office and apartment, as well as a hotel room he’d been using. The Trump lawyer is a figure in the ongoing Russia investigation overseen by special counsel Robert Mueller in Washington, but Manhattan-based government attorneys said in court that he is also under separate investigation for his business dealings. Cohen, who has not been publicly charged with any crimes, owns New York City taxi medallions. He has also been deeply involved in the $130,000 payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who has accused Trump of trying to cover up an affair she says the two had in 2006. In an interview with CNN last week, Cohen called the raid “unsettling to say the least.” But he also said in the same interview that the federal agents were “extremely professional, courteous and respectful” — a dramatic departure from his usual combative style. Those comments raised eyebrows among some in Trump’s inner circle, who noted that one of the president’s most ferocious attack dogs seemed unusually taciturn. “When anybody is faced with spending a long time in jail, they start to re-evaluate their priorities, and cooperation can’t be ruled out,” said one Trump ally who knows Cohen. Since the raid, the president and his advisers have been singularly focused on the risk of a potential federal prosecution of Cohen, which they view as a much bigger existential threat to the presidency than former FBI Director James Comey, whose book “A Higher Loyalty” has dominated headlines and even Trump’s Twitter feed even before its Tuesday release. Trump has regularly ranted to friends and advisers about the investigation into Cohen, according to two other people familiar with the conversations. He believes strongly that the FBI raid has pushed the boundaries of attorney-client privilege, telling friends that he and his associates are being unfairly targeted. “He’s not happy about it,” said one White House official. The White House appears to be creating some distance from Cohen. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters earlier this week that though Trump and Cohen have “still got some ongoing things,” the president “has a large number of attorneys, as you know.” Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or updates from  and you agree to our privacy policy and terms of service.

Trump said Wednesday during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that he wants the Mueller investigation “over with, done with.” He added that his administration is “giving tremendous amounts of paper” to investigators. A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. In a court filing last week, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York explained the FBI raid was “the result of a months-long investigation” into the president’s lawyer and that prosecutors were looking for evidence of crimes related to his business dealings. Trump and his allies fear that documents and recordings that the FBI swept up from Cohen’s home and office could come back to haunt the president, whose lawyers have joined Cohen’s in New York in asserting attorney-client privilege and are asking a federal judge to approve an independent review of the material. “Who knows what Cohen has in those files,” said a person close to the White House. But their concerns go beyond Cohen’s voluminous files. Increasingly, Trump’s outside advisers are worried about the risk posed by Cohen himself. “I think for two years or four years or five years, Michael Cohen would be a stand-up guy. I think he’d tell them go piss up a rope. But depending on dollars involved, which can be a big driver, or if they look at him and say it’s not two to four years, it’s 18 to 22, then how loyal is he?” said one defense lawyer who represents a senior Trump aide in Mueller’s Russia investigation. “Is he two years loyal? Is he 10 years loyal? Is he 15 years loyal?” the attorney added. “That’s the currency. It’s not measured in inches. It’s measured in years.” Jay Goldberg, a longtime Trump lawyer, told The Wall Street Journal that he spoke with Trump on Friday about Cohen and warned the president against trusting Cohen if he is facing criminal charges. Goldberg said he warned the president that Cohen “isn’t even a 1” on a scale of 1 to 100, where 100 was remaining fully loyal to the president, the newspaper reported. But others in Trump’s circle believe Cohen will remain loyal to the president, pointing to Cohen’s long, well-documented history of publicly defending the president, whether in business or politics. “I’m the guy who would take a bullet for the president,” Cohen told Vanity Fair in an interview last summer. Cohen tweeted earlier this month that he will “always protect” Trump. White House By JOSH MEYER Appearing on MSNBC on Wednesday, former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci said Cohen was not a risk to turn on Trump. “If you said to me and I had to flip a coin, is he going to turn on President Trump or turn on other people? I would say adamantly no,” he said. Cohen and Trump’s relationship dates back a dozen years. He was one of the earliest backers of the president’s political ambitions, and during the 2016 campaign served as a prominent adviser and spokesman, despite disagreements with others on the campaign. The two men reportedly had dinner together last month at the president’s Mar-a-Lago retreat in South Florida. They also spoke by phone last Friday as their lawyers were working together to try to shield materials seized in the FBI raid. The fallout from the FBI raid continued Wednesday for Cohen, who dropped two much-publicized libel lawsuits against BuzzFeed and the private investigation firm Fusion GPS over publication of the so-called dossier detailing alleged ties between Trump and Russia. Cohen’s attorney, David Schwartz, told the court the voluntary decision to drop the lawsuits was needed “given the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention, and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits.\" Cohen and his attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Experts tracking the case say indictments against Cohen are possible for bank and wire fraud. He could also end up becoming a target in Mueller’s Russia investigation. Mueller has already shown a willingness to play hardball. Former Trump aides Michael Flynn, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos have all pleaded guilty to various criminal charges and are cooperating. Onetime campaign manager Paul Manafort has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and tax evasion charges and is set to face trial starting in July. Legal experts noted that federal authorities face an uphill climb in turning lawyers against their clients. “It’s a bit of a moonshot if that’s what they are trying to do,” warned a second defense lawyer working on the Russia probe. The prospect of years or even decades in prison might be easier to swallow if Cohen believes a presidential pardon is possible. White House officials and others close to the president insist that last week’s decision to pardon former Vice President Dick Cheney’s senior aide I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby on perjury charges dating to his service in the George W. Bush administration was not intended to send a message to Cohen — but it nonetheless could go a long way toward reassuring the president’s lawyer. “They’re going to squeeze him like a grape. I think in the end he’ll pop unless Trump pardons him,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the nonprofit R Street Institute and a former senior counsel during independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation into President Bill Clinton. By KYLE CHENEY Hank Sheinkopf, a New York-based Democratic consultant who has worked with both Cohen and Trump, said the ties binding the attorney and the president will go a long way. But he, too, wouldn’t rule out how the pressure of prosecution would influence Cohen. “Here’s a guy who appears to be very tough, very loyal and has said publicly about how he feels about Mr. Trump. That shouldn’t change, but who knows what the future holds,” he said. “People change when pressure is put on them. He’s very loyal. He’s very stand-up. It’d be a difficult decision for him to make.” Cohen flipping “would be Trump’s worst nightmare,” said John Dean, the former White House counsel whose cooperation with Watergate prosecutors helped lead to President Richard Nixon’s resignation in 1974. “It would be as stunning and life-disrupting a surprise as his winning the presidency,” Dean added. “And if there is any prosecutor’s office in the USA that can flip Cohen, it is the Southern District of New York.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Congress The 'no hearings, no vote' stance has made Mitch McConnell an unlikely hero of the right, but that could change in an instant. By BURGESS EVERETT 03/28/2016 05:18 AM EDT Mitch McConnell's confidants say the message has been received. | Getty There are plenty of plausible reasons why Republicans might eventually fold in the standoff over the Supreme Court: overwhelming public opinion, a Democratic pressure campaign, and vulnerable GOP senators trying to save their jobs, to name a few. But there's another, even more persuasive, reason they won't: the wrath of the right wing. The activist right has been galvanized by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's quick and forceful insistence that the Senate will not take up a high court nominee for the rest of Barack Obama's presidency, spending millions already to defend the GOP position with likely lots more to come. Tea party groups that have dissed McConnell for years as an establishment sellout are singing his praises. It's safe to say all of that would end the instant Republicans agreed to take up Merrick Garland's nomination. And the fire would turn inward at the worst possible moment for Republicans, as the party is scrambling to save its narrow Senate majority in November. “If the senators start to move off of this position, the biggest problem they are going to face is going to be a loss of support … they’re going to alienate the most active part of their constituency,” said Adam Brandon, president and CEO of FreedomWorks. “I want Mitch McConnell to see that the potential grass-roots army is far stronger than anyone on K Street.” By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE Look no further than the reaction to Sen. Jerry Moran's (R-Kan.) break with party leadership last week — he said the Senate should take up Garland's nomination — to see how important it is to the base not to fill Antonin Scalia's vacant seat this year. The conservative Judicial Crisis Network vowed a \"robust\" campaign against Moran to change his mind. The Tea Party Patriots threatened to back a primary challenger against the first-term senator. It's easy enough to imagine the entire Senate GOP getting the same treatment. The JCN has already spent $4 million on ads, both bucking up McConnell and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and going after Democrats from red states. The deep-pocketed group says it has the resources to keep it up as long as needed. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, meanwhile, has been fundraising off the Supreme Court vacancy for weeks, a tactic that works only if the party remains united. And Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion rights, has shifted its focus from the presidential campaign to holding the Senate, with plans to spend millions helping senators who oppose abortion rights. “This would be the worst point in history for a cave to occur, and for that reason I do not believe it will,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group's president. “When there is true leadership coming out of the Senate, it’s a more appealing body to defend.” When former House Speaker John Boehner resigned under pressure last year, all eyes shifted across the Capitol to McConnell, who's drawn more than his share of flak from the right for cutting deals with Democrats. His vow for no hearings or vote on the president's court pick instantly remade the majority leader's reputation with his conservative adversaries. But the dynamic could change just as quickly if he backs away. congress By BURGESS EVERETT \"If Republican senators can't fulfill the basic task of defending the Constitution, they should be defeated at the ballot box,\" said Ken Cuccinelli of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a group that consistently works against McConnell. McConnell's confidants say the message has been received. People close to him say he's holding the line 100 percent, and that the Republican Conference overwhelmingly has his back. McConnell appeared on four Sunday political shows this month to repeat at length his plans to allow voters \"to weigh in” before the vacancy is filled. “This is first time I find myself praising Mitch,\" said Brandon of FreedomWorks. “I don’t think [conservatives] would be happy. I wouldn’t be happy” if McConnell relented, said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. “The idea that anybody is sort of exerting pressure and somebody’s going to crack is just not reality.” While a growing number of Republicans say they will meet with Garland, just three GOP senators — Moran and moderates Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois — have truly broken with the leader and called for hearings and consideration of Garland’s nomination. GOP senators such as Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio, all of whom face tough reelection campaigns, say they will meet with Garland merely to reiterate their position that the seat should be filled by the next president. Democrats believe McConnell is motivated by self-preservation. Siding with activists on the Supreme Court, they say, could help the majority leader avoid Boehner's fate. white house By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE “I do believe he’s going to lose the majority. And he’s hoping that 2018 is going to be better [electorally] and he wants to save his job so he’s around [to return to majority leader] in 2018,” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said in an interview. “He’s actually saving himself and sacrificing his people that are up this time. He knows what happened to Boehner.” Democrats would have socked McConnell for his handling of the Supreme Court no matter what. If he slow-walked the nomination, he would have been criticized for wasting time. And if Garland made it to the floor only to lose a vote, McConnell would have been accused of forcing his members to vote down a nomination of a qualified justice. By planting his flag early, McConnell ensured praise from unlikely allies. If he holds firm, it could temper criticism from the right of his deal-making with Democrats and perhaps stoke Republican turnout in November. “It is an example of leading ... when you lead, you take a principled position and you stick with it,\" said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a tea party favorite who lost a Senate bid in 2010. “Would people be upset if they say they’re taking a principled position and then back off of that? ... That would be a problem.” Lauren French contributed to this report. Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for  Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox. © 2021  LLC",

        "articles": "White House After watching the GOP make large gains in statehouses during his presidency, Obama is making a last-gasp attempt to build his party from the bottom up. By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE 10/23/2016 06:56 AM EDT The endorsements are Obama’s biggest investment in state races ever by far. | Getty President Barack Obama will make a late splash into races for state senate and assembly over the next week, endorsing roughly 150 candidates across 20 states. He’ll also back a candidate for the North Carolina Supreme Court. The endorsements — which will come along with a variety of robocalls, social media posts, mailers, photos of Obama with the candidates taken as he’s been traveling to campaign in recent weeks, and even a few radio ads — are Obama’s biggest investment in state races ever by far, and come as he gears up to make redistricting reform at the state level the political priority of his post-presidency. This is the beginning of that effort, an unprecedented engagement all the way down-ballot for any president. The first group of endorsements went public Friday, with 13 in Florida, but the White House has a much larger list ready to go, including races in states far from competitive territory for the presidential election and Senate races, “focused mostly on swing districts for maximum impact,” said White House political director David Simas. Democrats are hoping for an anti-Donald Trump wave to give them more of a defense against 2018 midterms that most expect will be tough for the party if Hillary Clinton wins. With Obama’s approval rating climbing — to 57 percent in the Gallup poll out Saturday — they’re hoping that hitching themselves to the president will make the difference. He’s also expected to hit close to 60 endorsements for House races this week, taping commercials and robocalls for many of them. Congress By RACHAEL BADE Six years ago, Democrats felt they couldn’t even get Obama interested in House races. But now, after years of the Democratic bench being depleted on his watch, Obama’s looking to build it back. On top of all that: a concern within the Oval Office and through the West Wing with how much policy is being crafted in state capitals, from laws on reproductive health to climate change to voting rights. “While Congress has been obstructionist and there’s been no substantive legislation moving under Republican control, what you see in the states is very, very different,” Simas said. “This has not been a focus of presidents in the past. But given what’s happening in state legislatures throughout the country, it has to be.” Though a former state senator himself, Obama had never endorsed in state legislature races as president before this year. He backed and cut a television ad for a state representative candidate looking to take out an incumbent whom local Democrats felt they’d been betrayed by, and whom the president had called out in his homecoming speech at the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield in February. Obama also taped a robocall for the candidate who went on to win the April special election for the seat of the former New York state Senate majority leader who’d just been convicted of corruption. Since then, White House aides put out word they were interested in doing more. There wasn’t a questionnaire or process set up ahead of time. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s arm for state legislature races in Washington, reached out to party caucuses in the states and provided recommendations. Candidates wrote letters. 2016 By STEVEN SHEPARD and CHARLIE MAHTESIAN Everyone went through the White House vetting process, with the West Wing guarding against anyone with a problematic personal or political record getting the president’s stamp of approval. Not everyone made it out. “There is a high demand,” Simas said. Although Election Day is just over two weeks away, the White House and allies argue that this is actually the prime moment to get involved. “In a lot of these super-down-ballot races, focus often doesn’t shift down the ballot until very late in the cycle,” said Carolyn Fiddler, communications director for the DLCC, who pointed out that many of these races will be decided by fewer than 500 votes. “Given where this campaign has gone from the national level on down, this is going to be a really good way to push a lot of these folks over the line.” Robert Asencio, a veteran of the Army Reserves and Miami-Dade Schools Police Department running for state representative in South Florida, said the path to the endorsement he received Friday started with a letter about his candidacy that he wrote to the White House long before anyone had told him Obama might want to get involved. He laid out his positions on the issues he cared about, and wanted the president to know. He said he never really expected to hear back. “I hadn’t really thought about it, and then I received a call that I had received an endorsement from the president,” Asencio said. Rep. José Javier Rodríguez, a Cuban-American running for a Democratic-leaning state Senate seat, said he’d also started out asking for Obama’s endorsement before he ever knew the president was interested in giving it, hoping to capitalize on what he felt months ago was already shaping up to be a good year for Democrats. With a presidential race and a Senate race underway, Rodríguez said he never would have expected Obama to endorse. But he said with this election cycle in Florida, using for the first time a map that’s been fought over for years, there’s a long-term importance. By NAHAL TOOSI “The fact that we are in the first true electoral test of a decade-long effort here in Florida to tackle gerrymandering makes this an opportunity to bring more balance to Tallahassee,\" an opportunity \"that has national significance,” Rodríguez said. Obama’s backing reminds all those voters he’s stirring up in his campaign trips to Florida to stay in the voting booth until they’ve made their way all the way through the ballot. “It’s turnout, but also voting down,” Rodríguez said. Ascensio and his team were taken so much by surprise that the president wanted to get involved in a race at this level that they haven’t yet figured out how to use the endorsements. Their mailers and materials to hand out are all printed already. But he said voters have already been bringing it up to him, to his surprise. “I hope it’ll convey the fact that the leader of this country has given me the trust of his endorsement,” he said. “I’m still absorbing what it means.” Fiddler summed it up for him and the other candidates who are getting presidential endorsements in their races for the first time ever. “This is huge,” Fiddler said. “We are thrilled.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "President Obama promised that the U.S. will provide the government of France whatever assistance is needed. | Getty 'This is not just an attack on Paris…but this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we all share,' the president said. By SARAH WHEATON and ELIZA COLLINS 11/13/2015 05:59 PM EST Updated 11/13/2015 06:51 PM EST By NICHOLAS VINOCUR President Barack Obama condemned Friday night’s attacks in Paris as an “outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians.” \"This is an attack not just on Paris, it’s an attack not just on the people of France,\" Obama told reporters at the White House, “but this is an attack on all humanity an the universal values that we share.” Obama continued, \"We stand prepared and ready to provide whatever assistance that the government and the people of France need to respond\" to the attacks, which left dozens dead in mulitple locations. About 100 hostages were in custody in a theater, according to the Associated Press and other news reports. Shortly before Obama’s remarks, the White House announced that he had been briefed by Lisa Monaco, his top counterterrorism adviser. Though he called the attacks an act of terrorism, Obama declined to speculate on who might be responsible. But Obama vowed to \"do whatever it takes to work with the French people and with nations around the world to bring these terrorists to justice, and to go after any terrorist networks that go after our people.\" By NICHOLAS VINOCUR \"Obviously those of us here in the United States know what it’s like,\" Obama said. \"Whenever these kinds of attacks happened, we’ve always been able to count on the French people to stand with us.\" Obama later spoke by telephone with French President Francois Hollande. A readout of the call provided by the White House said Obama offered \"the condolences of the American people for the horrific terrorist attacks in Paris earlier this evening. The President reiterated the United States' steadfast, unwavering support for the people of France, our oldest ally and friend, and reaffirmed the offer of any necessary support to the French investigation. The two leaders pledged to work together, and with nations around the world, to defeat the scourge of terrorism.\" Coincidentally, Obama spoke with Hollande earlier on Friday to discuss climate talks slated for next month in Paris. Late Friday, Hollande announced a state of emergency in France and said borders were being closed. Hollande said that the terrorists' goal was “to make us afraid, to seize us with fear.” While he acknowledged there was cause to be afraid it was important to note “faced with this fear there is a nation that defends itself and mobilizes itself.” “I’m asking here for you to maintain your trust in what the security forces can do,” Hollande said, according to a translation of his remarks. Obama's schedule, released after his remarks on Friday, showed he plans to leave for Turkey as scheduled on Saturday afternoon. Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. embassy was in the process of locating Americans who were abroad. “Our embassy in Paris is making every effort to account for the welfare of American citizens in the city,” Kerry said in a statement. “We stand with the French people tonight, as our peoples have always stood together in our darkest hours. These terrorist attacks will only deepen our shared resolve.” At the U.S. Capitol Friday night, police said they have enhanced security, though there is no known threat. The U.S. Capitol Police are monitoring events in Paris as well as getting real-time intelligence updates to maintain awareness of global events. Enhanced patrols throughout the Capitol Campus may be observed, conducted out of an abundance of caution. There is currently no known threat to the Capitol Complex. U.S. presidential candidates on both sides offered thoughts and prayers, calling the attacks “heartbreaking” “horrifying” and “horrible.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Rep. Keith Ellison had been laying the groundwork to run for DNC chairman even before the deep losses Democrats suffered on Election Day. | Getty By DANIEL STRAUSS 11/14/2016 03:18 PM EST Updated 11/14/2016 05:40 PM EST By LOUIS NELSON By DANIEL STRAUSS Rep. Keith Ellison on Monday formally announced his candidacy for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee. “I am proud to announce my candidacy for Chair of the Democratic National Committee, and if given the opportunity to serve, I will work tirelessly to make the Democratic Party an organization that brings us together and advances an agenda that improves people’s lives,” Ellison said in a statement. The Minnesota congressman had been laying the groundwork to run for the post even before the deep losses that Democrats suffered on Election Day. In recent days, his efforts began to come into public view. Ellison, who backed the presidential primary bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders, has already been endorsed for chairman by Sanders and Sens. Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid, as well as Rep. Raúl Grijalva, co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Ellison would make a “terrific” chairman. In his announcement Monday, Ellison rolled out additional endorsements from prominent Democrats including Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Chris Murphy of Connecticut — both supporters of Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid — Hawaii Democratic Party Chairman Tim Vandeveer, former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak and Minnesota Democratic Party Chairman Ken Martin. Rybak had often been mentioned as a possible candidate for DNC chairman himself. “Having worked on elections and social movements with Keith Ellison for more than two decades, I can say I have never seen him campaign only for himself,” Rybak said in a statement. “More a community organization than a politician, Keith has used every campaign to protect every voter’s rights, expand our party’s base, include those left behind and elevate new leaders. That is exactly what the Democratic Party needs right now.” Ellison’s support from Klobuchar and Murphy was viewed as a sign that the Minnesota congressman might be able to attract support from beyond the Sanders wing of the party — his base of support. Many Democratic leaders in Washington and the states fear the chairmanship race could devolve into a repeat of the acrimonious Clinton-Sanders primary. “I think there is a great deal to be said for putting an active Sanders supporter in there. I want to go into 2020 without these kinds of suspicions and paranoia,” former Rep. Barney Frank, who backed Clinton, said Monday. Going into the weekend, Ellison was still reaching out to Democrats around the country to gauge support for his prospective candidacy. Virginia Democratic Party Chairwoman Susan Swecker was among those who received a call from Ellison. Swecker said Ellison called and, while he didn’t say that he was running, the timing seemed to indicate that. “We had a nice conversation; I expect to hear from some others,” Swecker said Monday of her call with Ellison, who didn’t explicitly say that he was running. Swecker said she hasn’t decided who she’ll support in the race. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean has already announced that he’s running for DNC chairman, and the field of candidates is likely to expand. Among others who have expressed interest: former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, New Hampshire Chairman Ray Buckley and South Carolina Chairman Jaime Harrison, who has been talking with fellow DNC committee members about a possible bid. Labor Secretary Tom Perez’s name has also been floating among Democrats. Shortly after Ellison’s announcement, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee endorsed him. The PCCC, a liberal outside group, aligns itself closely with Warren. Last week, Dean argued that Ellison couldn’t adequately serve as both DNC chairman and as a member of Congress. “You cannot do this job and sit in a political office at the same time. It’s not possible,” Dean said in an interview on MSNBC. That view is shared by critics of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s tenure as DNC chairwoman. But Ellison’s supporters insist that the Minnesota congressman can juggle both jobs. “I think he’s completely equipped to hold both jobs,” said former Nevada Democratic National Committeewoman Erin Bilbray, a former backer of Sanders’ presidential campaign. Asked about Dean’s bid, Bilbray said she didn’t have anything against the former DNC chairman but that there needs to be “fresh leadership with new ideas.” “I believe very strongly that the Sanders base is the future of our Democratic Party; that is where the party’s going between the millennials and Gen-Xers,” Bilbray said. “They want new ideas, and I think Ellison represents that. Dean is a good man, but he comes from a different era.” The DNC member vote for the next chair isn’t expected to take place until the first quarter of next year, perhaps in February or March, according to Democrats involved in the process.

        "articles": "Department of Justice The deputy attorney general ridicules talk of a Republican drive to impeach him. By JOSH GERSTEIN 05/01/2018 04:52 PM EDT Updated 05/01/2018 06:15 PM EDT “There have been people that have been making threats, publicly and privately, against me for quite some time, and I think they should understand by now: The Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said . | Win McNamee/Getty Images The Justice Department official overseeing the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia insisted on Tuesday that he wouldn’t be intimidated by suggestions from conservative Republican lawmakers that he be impeached for defying requests for congressional oversight. “There have been people that have been making threats, publicly and privately, against me for quite some time, and I think they should understand by now: The Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said during an appearance at the Newseum in Washington. “Any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job. We have a responsibility and we take an oath. That’s the whole point.” Rosenstein did not chronicle the threats he was addressing, but he has often been the focus of public and private anger from President Donald Trump, who has blamed him for launching special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation last May. Just a few weeks ago, Trump took to Twitter to take a direct shot at the Justice Department’s No. 2 official. “Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy,” Trump wrote. And just last week, Trump suggested during a TV interview that he’d like to remove Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Rosenstein, but probably wouldn’t until Mueller’s investigation was complete. Asked later about whether the deputy attorney general’s remarks were directed at Trump, a White House spokesman demurred. “Well, obviously, you’re going to have to ask Mr. Rosenstein about that,” Hogan Gidley, a deputy press secretary, said on CNN. “That has nothing to do with us. And, obviously, you’re going to have to ask Congress about their willingness to draft these articles of impeachment.” A Justice Department spokesman said Rosenstein’s discussion of threats did not refer to Trump. “He was not referring to the president. [He] was referring to some in Congress,” the spokesman said. During the question-and-answer session on Tuesday marking “Law Day,” the mild-mannered Rosenstein could not resist a swipe at whoever on Capitol Hill was behind a version of proposed articles of impeachment against him being circulated by GOP lawmakers and published in The Washington Post.

I mean, I don’t know who wrote it. It really does illustrate, though, a really important distinction between the way we operate in the Department of Justice — if we’re going to accuse somebody of wrongdoing, we have to have admissible evidence and credible witnesses. We need to be prepared to prove our case in court. … We have people who are accountable. And so I just don’t have anything to say about documents like that that nobody has the courage to put their name on.” Rosenstein has clashed with GOP lawmakers over demands that the Justice Department hand over records related to the 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server as well as the FBI’s Russia inquiry. Democrats worry that the tension over documents is a pretext for Trump to oust Rosenstein and assert more control over the Mueller investigation. The articles drafted by Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina and other Freedom Caucus allies accuse Rosenstein of multiple transgressions, including failure to follow surveillance laws, remove staff with conflicts of interest and produce documents to Congress in a timely way. Meadows fired back at Rosenstein shortly after his remarks. “If he believes being asked to do his job is ‘extortion,’ then Rod Rosenstein should step aside and allow us to find a new Deputy Attorney General—preferably one who is interested in transparency,” Meadows tweeted. Many of the questions asked on Tuesday at the Newseum event were like a minefield for Rosenstein, urging him to weigh in on a variety of issues that could land him in more hot water with Trump, lawmakers or others. When one questioner asked the deputy attorney general whether a sitting president could be indicted, the longtime prosecutor pointed to a Justice Department opinion that says the president cannot be charged criminally while in office. But Rosenstein did not explicitly endorse that legal view. Warning the audience that it “shouldn’t draw any inference” from his answer, Rosenstein said: “The Department of Justice in the past, when the issue arose, has opined that a sitting president cannot be indicted. There’s been a lot of speculation in the media about it. … When the issue arose, somebody in the department reached a legal conclusion, and that’s what it is.” Rosenstein gave a cryptic answer when asked for his thoughts on the decisions made by top Justice Department officials in the so-called Saturday Night Massacre in October 1973, when Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned rather than carry out President Richard Nixon’s order to fire the Watergate special counsel, Archibald Cox. Rosenstein noted that Richardson and Ruckelshaus said they resigned because of a pledge Richardson had given the Senate that he would not dismiss Cox and not because they considered Nixon’s directive to be illegal. “To the best of my knowledge, it wasn’t an unlawful order. I think Richardson, Ruckelshaus and Bork all made what they thought were principled decisions,” Rosenstein said, referring to Solicitor General Robert Bork, who carried out Nixon’s order. By DARREN SAMUELSOHN and BRENT D. GRIFFITHS As in past speeches, Rosenstein insisted that the Trump administration was adhering to the rule of law. He even praised a “Law Day” proclamation extolling the virtue of the rule of law. Such statements from Rosenstein have drawn mockery from his critics and even some of his friends, who point to Trump’s repeated public calls for jailing his political opponents, his public demands for criminal investigations and his talk of shutting down Mueller’s investigation. “There is no doubt by anybody in the Department of Justice that we are complying with the rule of law,” Rosenstein said. “I think the morale of the attorneys of the department is very high.” And despite repeated reports of Trump’s weighing in with the department on specific investigations, Rosenstein asserted that both Justice officials and those at the White House were abiding by longstanding limits on such discussions. “We have certain rules about what we can and can’t discuss,” he said. “I can assure you that we are faithful to those rules, as is the White House.” Rosenstein also said that while there were sometimes tensions involved in his job, he was not convinced he was a witness to an exceptional time in U.S. history. “Everybody always thinks that the current moment is an unprecedented moment,” he said, “but it really isn’t.” Kyle Cheney and Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.

By BRETT NORMAN 09/21/2015 06:08 PM EDT Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is calling on a drug company to justify a dramatic spike in the price of a 62-year-old drug that was reported Sunday. One day before rival Hillary Clinton is set to propose a plan to rein in high costs for specialty drugs, Sanders in a letter to Turing Pharmaceuticals demanded an explanation for why the price of a drug used to treat dangerous parasitical infections leapt from $13.50 per tablet to $750 after the company acquired the drug from a competitor. The price hike followed the sale of the drug, Daraprim, to Turing in August for $55 million, the New York Times reported. “The enormous, overnight price increase for Daraprim is just the latest in a long list of skyrocketing price increases for certain critical medications,” wrote Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings, who are investigating sudden jumps in the costs of older, generic medicines. Sanders was the first presidential candidate to propose a plan to combat high prescription drug costs, which recent polls have found to be Americans’ top health care priority, outranking Obamacare even among Republicans and independents. 2016 By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI Clinton will announce her own plan during a campaign event Tuesday. In a tweet Monday, Clinton referenced the controversy over Daraprim, saying “Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous.

        "articles": "Transportation The president-elect's pitch for an upgrade of the nation’s roads, bridges, tunnels and airports is already running into Washington reality. By LAUREN GARDNER 11/20/2016 07:07 AM EST Donald Trump's advisers are floating the same kinds of financing schemes that Congress has batted around for years with little success. | Getty It was supposed to be a big, beautiful infrastructure bill. But President-elect Donald Trump’s pitch for a $1 trillion upgrade of the nation’s roads, bridges, tunnels and airports is already running into potholes as it meets reality in Washington. The overwhelming sticking point, as always, is how to pay for it. Trump's advisers are so far floating the same kinds of financing schemes that Congress has batted around for years with little success, including proposals to lure private investors or reap a revenue windfall through an overhaul of the tax code. Key lawmakers say they’re in the dark on how Trump’s plan would work — with some conservatives simply hoping that his call for massive tax breaks will provide an economic jolt that makes the hard spending decisions easier. Democrats, meanwhile, are split on whether to cooperate with Trump on his plan. Hillary Clinton adviser Ron Klain denounced it Friday as a \"trap\" that would provide \"a massive corporate welfare plan for contractors\" without necessarily spurring any new infrastructure spending. Even congressional Republicans who have long championed spending on transportation projects say they don’t yet know the details of Trump’s 10-year proposal, which the president-elect has vowed will “put millions of our people to work” while making U.S. infrastructure “second to none.” \"Look, we don't have the details,\" House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) told . \"We're working very closely with his transition team and hopefully with the new department head to figure out how we're going to pay for it. It's got to be fiscally responsible.\" A trillion dollars is “a big number,” said Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.), adding that a tax overhaul could be one promising way to pay for it. “I think it's going to come down to figuring out just actually what's achievable.” “I think this is critical, something that could draw us together,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who hoped that the infrastructure plan would also include an expansion of broadband internet service. But asked whether a Republican Congress would approve it, she said: “Not if it’s not paid for.” “To just add it to the national debt, I don’t think President-elect Trump or members of the Republican Conference would support that,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a member of the House Transportation Committee and the conservative Freedom Caucus. Some Democratic lawmakers were more optimistic than others than any big infrastructure plan will get through Congress, even with a GOP president pushing it. \"The country needs it,\" said New York Democratic Rep. José Serrano, who sits on the Appropriations Committee. But he said Trump “should be telling us how he’s going to get it through a Congress that doesn’t want to spend $1.50 on anything.” Congress By MAGGIE SEVERNS and THEODORIC MEYER Trump has touted his infrastructure plan as a top priority — even mentioning it in his election-night victory speech — raising expectations that it will have a prime place in the agenda for his first 100 days. His senior adviser Steve Bannon has portrayed it as a massive borrow-and-spending binge that would make conservatives \"go crazy,\" telling The Hollywood Reporter: \"With negative interest rates throughout the world, it's the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. ... We're just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks.\" But despite its eye-popping $1 trillion price tag, it’s unclear to infrastructure finance experts whether his plan would involve much, or even any, additional federal spending on top of the five-year, $305 billion transportation bill that Congress approved last year. Trump advisers walking in and out of Trump Tower in the past week have floated some ideas on how to pay for the plan, which has also seemed to morph day-by-day. The Heritage Foundation's Stephen Moore, one of Trump's tax advisers, pitched GOP lawmakers Tuesday on a one-time 10 percent tax on offshore business income, the kind of tax break that Republicans maintain would encourage companies to bring their overseas earnings back to the U.S. But by Wednesday morning, Steven Mnuchin, a leading contender for Treasury secretary, told reporters the transition team was “looking at the creation of an infrastructure bank,” a pot of money that would use federal money to attract state and private dollars to fund projects. It’s hardly a new idea in transportation circles — but Trump’s presidential campaign had blasted Clinton for proposing the same idea, saying such a bank would be “controlled by politicians and bureaucrats in Washington D.C.\" President Barack Obama has also repeatedly proposed an infrastructure bank, though that idea went nowhere in Congress. Trump’s campaign also called for setting up “public-private partnerships,” another means of encouraging private investors to put their money into infrastructure. In one version, the investors would get tax credits to build a project and could recoup their money by charging fees for its use, such as tolls. But as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote Saturday, that would be problematic for types of infrastructure that don't generate revenue streams: \"Toll roads are not the main thing we need right now; what about sewage systems, making up for deferred maintenance, and so on?\" Whatever the financing mechanism, some Republicans say Trump may be the one to sell it. “His business acumen is going to give him a better handle on the fiscal reality than we’ve had heretofore,” said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.). Congress By DANIEL STRAUSS In fact, policy experts from both sides of the aisle have faulted Trump’s broad tax and spending agenda for not even remotely adding up. They say the tax cuts he’s proposed would add $10 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade, while his pledge to trim the debt to zero would require savage cuts to federal spending. But Meadows said he hopes Trump’s tax cuts would bring a surge in revenue. “That stimulus provides an economic boom that will get us back to a 4, 4.5-percent GDP growth,” he said. “That will actually make some of these questions a lot easier to answer than at an anemic 2.2-to-maybe-2.8 GDP.” Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) echoed the kind of infrastructure-spending-equals-jobs argument that conservatives rejected when Obama was pushing his $832 billion stimulus through a Democratic Congress nearly eight years ago. “The federal government will get money back because, as I said, these are good-paying jobs,” Barletta said. “You’re going to be putting people to work. They’re going to be paying taxes. That money is going to come back to Washington.” But beyond wide support for the idea of infrastructure spending, Republicans’ unanimity breaks down quickly — especially when it comes to using repatriated money from corporations' overseas earnings. House Ways and Means Committee Republicans such as Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas and Dave Reichert of Washington state have indicated they're lukewarm at best to that idea, saying repatriation revenues should go to lowering tax rates instead. The difference this time, some lawmakers and lobbyists say, is the push infrastructure will be getting from an emboldened President Trump. In contrast, Obama has mostly chosen to stay out of the long-term funding debate in hopes Congress would come to a decision. \"We've had zero leadership coming from the current administration,\" said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), who leads the Appropriations Subcommittee for Department of Transportation spending. \"No suggestions, no ideas — they've just been kind of like pretending it's not an issue.” Obama has proposed some funding ideas, but lawmakers dismissed them as either unrealistic or gimmicky, as in his proposal to use savings from a hoped-for drawdown of troops overseas. Republicans ridiculed the proposal for a $10.25-a-barrel oil tax that he included in his last budget. Democrats find a variety of flaws in Trump’s proposal, especially the reliance on public-private partnerships. Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Transportation Committee, said those partnerships won't do much for the 143,000 bridges that need work nationwide \"unless you're going to toll 143,000 bridges.\" He said the same goes for the interstate highways \"unless you're going to start massive tolling of already constructed infrastructure to reconstruct it.\" The Big Idea By ROB HOFFMAN \"So it'll help with individual sorts of big projects, but it's not any kind of cure-all, and it certainly isn't going to get the big bang that Trump has talked about in infrastructure,\" DeFazio said. DeFazio said he would propose indexing the gasoline tax to inflation, so that the rate would rise over time, or implementing a wholesale barrel tax on oil. “If they want to put people to work quickly and they want a big bang in infrastructure, they need real money,\" he said. At least one House Republican agrees: Former Transportation Chairman Don Young of Alaska said he would also hike the gas tax to pay for transportation projects, and he faulted both his own party and Obama for blocking it in past years. “There’s no pie in the sky, no magic wand,” Young said. “We have to pay for it.” If Republicans settle on a plan, Democrats might be the key to passing it, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in an interview. “There was partisan hostility to anything President Obama wanted from the Republican side,” Whitehouse said. “So with President Trump supporting it and with Democrats supporting it, I think there’s the prospect of a filibuster-proof majority emerging around that bill.” But Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said he’s not yet ready to sign onto Trump’s plan — whatever it turns out to be. “I haven’t seen it, and nobody’s seen it,” Leahy said. “A lot of his plans seem to change day by day. I’ll wait till I see it.” Bernie Becker, Brianna Gurciullo, Jennifer Scholtes and Tanya Snyder contributed to this report. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "ELECTIONS Progressives may not have as much sway as they claim, strategists say. By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE 04/09/2015 07:43 AM EDT A win by Jesús “Chuy” García in the Chicago mayor’s race this week would have sent a signal that the progressive wing of the Democratic Party would be a decisive force in 2016, and that Hillary Clinton better do what they want or get out of the way. But Garcia lost. Big. And Rahm Emanuel, the combative former chief of staff to President Barack Obama who spent the race being hammered for caring more about big donors from Big Business than unions or working people, will be sworn in again next month for a second term as mayor. To many Democrats, there are two possible lessons: First, that the professional left talks a much better game than it delivers even as it starts to make big promises about the presidential race. And second, that focusing voters on the progressive elements of a candidate’s record, as Emanuel did during his runoff, can blunt a challenge from an ineffective opponent. Also on  ANDREW RESTUCCIA “Rahm Emanuel is a progressive mayor, period,” said Paul Begala, a longtime Bill Clinton adviser and a friend of Emanuel who advises the pro-Hillary Clinton Priorities super PAC. “I don’t think people should say a right-wing Democrat won. I think you’ve got to actually look at what he did and what he ran on.” “That’s the lesson for Hillary Clinton: You can run comfortably on a progressive agenda and win,” Begala said. Ben LaBolt, a former spokesman for both Emanuel and Obama, said progressive groups tried to assert themselves but ignored Emanuel’s record on everything from raising the minimum wage to expanding community college access, efforts that have become a partial model for the White House. “There was a roadshow of national progressive groups that came into Chicago and tried to use the race to send a message about the issues and messages they cared about, but in some ways, they misjudged the race,” LaBolt said. “For all the discussion there’s been about ideological warfare within the party, ultimately it’s more of the bread-and-butter issues that affect people’s lives that are going to determine their vote.” The progressive groups that got involved in the race disagree about Emanuel’s record. But they insist they showed themselves and their agenda to be just as powerful losing to Emanuel as if they’d won. “The headline would have been unmistakable and the clarity would have certainly been there,” said Jim Dean, chairman of Democracy for America, which weighed in heavily for García. But “if any of these campaigns had anybody on the ground in Chicago and seen the level of energy around Chuy’s campaign and around the aldermen who were running, they would understand this.” Also on  KENNETH P. VOGEL and JOSH GERSTEIN Instead its “populist groundswell gave Chuy García a fighting chance,” as Reclaim Chicago of the National People’s Action Campaign put it Tuesday night. García was, at best, an imperfect messenger for progressives: Unlike Bill de Blasio who became a national progressive hero by winning a much different New York City mayor’s race in 2013, García was often short on both policy detail and political skill. De Blasio took heat for pledging to raise taxes on the rich for his ideas. García repeatedly ducked questions of how he’d pay for his. The Chicago runoff never got close enough for Obama to seriously consider a last-minute visit to push his former chief of staff over the top, according to a White House aide. Instead, Emanuel’s campaign spent millions on an image-softening push that closed with a final commercial of the mayor, sporting an open-collar shirt and with soft piano music playing in the background, touting his all-day kindergarten program and the new jobs he brought to all neighborhoods — and acknowledging he could try being a better person himself. Although a presidential race will mean everyone’s paying a lot more attention to every position Clinton takes and every element of her record, she’s not expected to have a progressive primary opponent such as Elizabeth Warren to draw off votes. Unlike Emanuel, she’ll also have a Republican opponent, one elected out of a field that’s sure to produce a candidate progressives won’t be able to stand and will rally against even if their hearts aren’t with Clinton. That’s not the only difference. “She doesn’t have the problem that he does — the ‘asshole’ factor,” said a Democratic strategist familiar with both the Emanuel and de Blasio campaigns. “If I were Hillary Clinton looking at Chicago, I would say Rahm found himself in trouble largely because of personality clashes, and he survived because he was laser-focused on making his campaign an expression of his progressive successes.” But it’s clear that progressives are less than enthusiastic about Clinton, and unions and other lefty groups are likely to start popping off soon about how this really might be the year when they’ll sit out, or vote for someone else. “This is a new era. There is a much more progressive bench of this party, and the energy of this party is in the progressive party. That is going to be the key to voter turnout and voter engagement in 2016,” Dean said. But as one measure, Dean’s brother, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, endorsed García but has already endorsed Clinton. De Blasio is taking pains to stay close to her. García’s 43 percent “even as he was dramatically outspent and despite the challenges he faced shows the power of the idea that government and the economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top,” said Nick Berning, communications director of MoveOn.org. “The lesson elected officials should draw from Chicago is that they ignore this hunger at their peril.” Begala said he’s not concerned. If anything, he thinks Democrats should come out of Chicago feeling good about the unity within the party that produced a low-impact challenger for Emanuel and a seemingly untouchable front-runner for president, unlike the giant ideological rifts that Republican 2016 candidates are trying to navigate. Also on  ANDREW RESTUCCIA “It’s really hard for people to confront this reality,” Begala said, “but Democrats are in array.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "The party establishment flexes its muscles in a bid to flip a Republican House seat. By MATT FRIEDMAN 04/15/2018 06:52 AM EDT Updated 04/15/2018 10:51 AM EDT State Sen. Jeff Van Drew raises his hand at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's farewell address on Jan. 9 in Trenton. Van Drew is viewed as having the inside track with national Democrats for his campaign for the open seat in the 2nd Congressional District. | M. Scott Mahaskey/ Jeff Van Drew has voted against raising the minimum wage and gay marriage. He often sides with industry on environmental issues and carries an A rating from the NRA. And he’s the odds-on favorite to be New Jersey’s newest Democratic congressman. In the party’s first real crack at winning the South Jersey-based district held by retiring Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-N.J.) for more than two decades, the Democratic Party establishment — at every level — is throwing its collective weight behind Van Drew, leaving local progressives baffled, frustrated and more than a little angry. The race is a showcase for whether the Democratic Party nationally will tolerate politicians like Van Drew, a state senator, in the name of winning the majority in the U.S. House for the first time since 2011. It highlights Democrats’ struggles to blend their stated ideals on issues like diversity and gun control with the political realities of a district, in this case a working-class bastion that voted for President Donald Trump by 4 points after twice voting for President Barack Obama. Nationally, the Democratic Party has seen a surge of progressive activism in the wake of Trump’s election, and New Jersey’s 2nd Congressional District is no exception. So liberal activists, who frequently gathered in front of LoBiondo’s office to demand a town hall meeting that never came, have turned their ire on Democratic leaders. “It makes me feel a bit insulted and betrayed,” said Alison Arne, an Atlantic County activist who co-chairs the group Actions Together New Jersey Atlantic County.

Two other candidates for the Democratic nomination to replace LoBiondo fit the mold of 2018 Democrats. Will Cunningham is an openly gay African-American attorney who grew up poor and despite being homeless at one point as a teen, went to an Ivy League university and became an Obama administration official, and an adviser to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Tanzie Youngblood is a retired African-American teacher and military mom. And Nate Kleinman, a farmer who runs a nonprofit and was active in the Occupy movement, was dubbed the first “Occupy candidate” when he sought a House seat in Pennsylvania six years ago. Democrats spent two decades struggling to recruit viable candidates to run in the district against LoBiondo, who first won the seat in 1994. Now, Van Drew will almost certainly win the primary and is heavily favored to win the seat in November. “The DCCC needs to take a look at themselves in the mirror and make sure we’re reflective of who we’re sending to D.C.,” Cunningham said of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has all but officially thrown in with Van Drew after trying for at least a decade to recruit him to run there. “We as the Democratic Party, if we’re going to talk the talk, we’ve got to walk the walk.” The anger has spilled out into public forums. At one, high school student Emily McGrath confronted Van Drew — who had one day earlier told her class he did not accept donations from the NRA — about a $1,000 donation she had discovered. The videotaped confrontation, in which McGrath said “Senator, you lied,” made headlines around the state. But don’t look for a nail-biter primary like in Illinois, where conservative Democrat Dan Lipinski narrowly survived a primary challenge last month. The 2nd District, New Jersey’s southernmost and largest geographically, includes Atlantic City’s gleaming casino towers, farmland and the poorest county in the state. It’s more working class than its New Jersey counterparts to the north, with the lowest percentage of college-educated residents in the state. And Van Drew has represented the district’s most Republican portion in the state Senate and Assembly for 16 years, comfortably winning reelection despite several major GOP efforts against him. To have a Democratic candidate who’s already popular in the most conservative part of the congressional district is like a dream to Democrats more concerned with flipping a Republican House seat than with ideological purity. They point to Conor Lamb, the conservative Democrat who won a deep-red House district in Pennsylvania in March. “I think it’s a lot of the same criticism you heard about that guy,“ said Atlantic County Democratic Chairman Michael Suleiman. “Do you want a guy who’s with you 70 percent of the time? Or do you want a Republican who’s with you 0 percent of the time?” White House By NANCY COOK Meanwhile, there are some hints that Van Drew is moving leftward. Earlier this year, conservative websites pointed out that he quietly withdrew his sponsorship of bills to reinstate the death penalty and require parental notification for abortions. “Candidly, I’m to the left of Jeff,” Suleiman said. “But I also want to win. Because I’ve been around long enough to know if there’s one thing Democrats are good at, it’s screwing up elections.” Establishment Democrats stress that Van Drew has voted with the party on bread-and-butter priorities like paid sick leave and paid family leave. While Van Drew doesn’t have the kind of voting record that generally plays well in a Democratic primary, he has some things that his challengers lack: organization and money. He‘s backed by the local Democratic organization in all eight counties in the district, which gives him advantageous placement on the ballot. And the three candidates running to his left threaten to dilute the progressive vote. Then there’s the issue of money. Before LoBiondo’s retirement announcement, when Youngblood and Sean Thom — who has since dropped out — were the only candidates in the race, DCCC staff helped prep Youngblood for her campaign launch, and she attended its candidate week in October. But national Democrats were left unimpressed with her anemic fundraising in a district that includes the Philadelphia media market — one of the most expensive in the country. As of the end of last year, Youngblood had raised only about $50,000 — almost half of which came from her own pocket. Van Drew raised only about $80,000, but a campaign source said his next filing will show about $400,000 raised. Cunningham and Kleinman entered the race after Van Drew. By JIMMY VIELKIND “Sen. Van Drew has built the strongest Democratic campaign this district has seen in more than two decades,” said DCCC spokeman Evan Lukaske. “In addition to earning the unanimous backing of local Democrats, Van Drew has an unmatched record of service to this community, deep ties to grass-roots supporters and a proven ability to win tough races.“ But Arne, the activist, said she felt Democrats didn’t take the opportunity for a pickup in the district seriously until LoBiondo retired. Once that happened, even before Van Drew formally declared his campaign, all of South Jersey’s Democratic Party leaders rallied around him. “Last year for the 2017 state legislative races, we really stood up and did a lot of work to get the local communities more engaged,” Arne said. “So when they turned it around like this on us, it’s like they didn’t listen and they don’t really care.” © 2021  LLC This browser does not support the Ad element.",

        "articles": "Corey Lewandowski is the first of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s most significant witnesses who had no formal role in the White House to be served with a subpoena by the Judiciary Committee. | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Congress By ANDREW DESIDERIO and KYLE CHENEY 08/15/2019 01:45 PM EDT Updated 08/15/2019 03:40 PM EDT The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday subpoenaed former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former top White House aide Rick Dearborn for details about their knowledge of potential obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. The subpoenas — which demand public testimony on Sept. 17 — come on the same day Lewandowski intends to appear alongside Trump at a campaign rally in New Hampshire, where Lewandowski has begun to openly consider a Senate campaign. Lewandowski is also the first of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s most significant witnesses who had no formal role in the White House to be served with a subpoena by the Judiciary Committee as it considers whether to recommend articles of impeachment. That subpoena in particular will test the president’s ability to block him from cooperating, as he has with most other witnesses subpoenaed by Congress. In one of Mueller’s most damning findings, Lewandowski described to him a directive from Trump that he tell then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he must constrain Mueller’s investigation or be fired. Lewandowski, at one point, asked Dearborn to deliver the message to Sessions instead, but Dearborn ultimately refused. In a second episode, according to the special counsel’s report, the president again asked Lewandowski to pressure Sessions to limit Mueller’s scope to future election interference attempts.

The subpoenas also come as the Judiciary Committee is intensifying its public posture on impeachment, making clear in recent court filings that it is actively considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president. “This will help the committee determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president or other Article 1 remedies,” Nadler added. “No one is above the law.” Lewandowski has testified before the House Intelligence Committee but refused to answer questions about anything other than his work on the Trump campaign. In a statement, his lawyer Peter Chavkin questioned why his client would need to appear once again before a congressional panel, but did not indicate whether Lewandowski plans to comply with the subpoena. “Mr. Lewandowski has voluntarily appeared before and cooperated with Congress three times, answering questions for hours,” Chavkin said. “He also has spoken for hours with the special counsel’s office. In light of this, it is fair to ask what could be gained from requiring him to appear yet again.” Some Democrats had privately been pressing to subpoena Lewandowski sooner because his lack of a formal White House role would make him less susceptible to efforts by the Trump White House to stonewall the committee’s demands. The White House has already asserted claims that former top aides to the president — including former White House counsel Don McGahn and former communications director Hope Hicks — are “absolutely immune” from testifying before Congress. The White House also directed McGahn’s former deputy Annie Donaldson to refuse to answer the committee’s questions that centered on her White House tenure — specifically, her knowledge of potential obstruction by Trump. The Judiciary Committee filed suit last week against McGahn, Mueller’s star witness, to compel his testimony about Trump’s efforts to interfere with or otherwise constrain the Mueller investigation. Lewandowski’s appearance at Trump’s rally follows a rash of concern among New Hampshire Republicans that a Trump-backed Senate bid by such a polarizing figure could jeopardize GOP chances to defeat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). The subpoena — a reminder both of Lewandowski’s full cooperation with Mueller and his centrality to the obstruction case against Trump — is sure to add to New Hampshire Republicans’ worries. A Republican aide to the House Judiciary Committee described the subpoenas as a waste of time and taxpayer dollars, noting that the committee has had access to Lewandowski and Dearborn's FBI interview summaries \"for months,\" the first acknowledgment that these documents were included in a cache of Mueller materials that the Justice Department made available to lawmakers.

        "articles": "Air Force Two lands at Pope Army Airfield near Fayetteville, N.C., for a visit from Vice President Mike Pence on July 17. | Melissa Sue Gerrits/The Fayetteville Observer via AP white house The White House had been mum about the sudden cancellation of a vice presidential trip to New Hampshire earlier this month. By TRENT SPINER 07/22/2019 03:19 PM EDT Vice President Mike Pence was one short plane ride away from shaking hands with an alleged interstate drug dealer. Pence abruptly canceled his trip to Manchester, N.H., earlier this month but never said why he was pulled from Air Force Two at the last minute. The vice president’s aides and even President Donald Trump himself kept up the suspense. “You'll know in about two weeks,” Trump told reporters at the time. “There was a very interesting problem that they had in New Hampshire.” Among the problems was a federal law enforcement probe involving individuals Pence would likely encounter, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the incident. If Pence stepped off the vice presidential aircraft, one of the people he would have seen on the ground was under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration for moving more than $100,000 of fentanyl from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. Jeff Hatch, who agreed in federal court Friday to plead guilty and will face up to four years in prison, works for an opioid addiction treatment center in southern New Hampshire that Pence was set to visit. A former New York Giants player, he has spoken publicly for years about his own challenge with drug and alcohol addiction, which ended his football career.

Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and is known throughout the state for warning students about the dangers of using drugs. “He has been beaten down in the past, but now stands tall in front of audiences to personally share his compelling story,” says a listing offering him to speak to groups. The vice president’s office declined to comment, and Pence has declined to discuss the incident. The early July event had been billed by his office as “a roundtable discussion with former patients and alumni at the Granite Recovery Center headquarters” followed by remarks from Pence “on the opioid crisis and illegal drug flow in New Hampshire.” The vice president’s aides have said they would reschedule his trip to New Hampshire. Federal court documents released Friday said Hatch was caught in 2017 with 1,500 grams of fentanyl. A baggie of the drug sold on the streets of New Hampshire is usually about one-tenth of a gram. Earlier that year, federal, state and local police began an investigation into a supplier of drugs flowing into Manchester, N.H, an area hit hard by the opioid epidemic. More than 500 people a year have been dying in New Hampshire for the last several years and the crisis does not appear to be abating. Federal authorities focused on Hatch. In court documents, they allege Hatch made a call in the early morning hours of July 25, 2017, to arrange a pickup of drugs from a supplier in Lawrence, Mass. He allegedly brought the drugs back to his home in New Hampshire, later distributing smaller amounts to couriers. A law enforcement official said Hatch agreed to help authorities arrest other dealers higher in the food chain in exchange for a more lenient sentence. He was charged with a single count of using a telephone to help commit a crime, according to court records. He agreed to be sentenced to up to four years in federal prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. Scott Murray, the U.S. attorney for the state, did not return a call about the leniency of the charges. Hatch did not return a message left on his cell phone. Hatch until Monday was the chief business development officer for Granite Recovery Centers, which provides treatment for substance abuse. After this story first published, Granite Recovery Centers CEO Eric Spofford said in a statement: “I am shocked and disappointed to learn today that Jeff Hatch has pled guilty to a drug offense. Granite Recovery Centers terminated Jeff’s employment today immediately upon learning about this matter.” Two months before federal authorities allege he made the drug pickup, Hatch stood with Sen. Shaheen to warn students about drug use, using his personal story. According to WMUR-TV, Hatch told the students he began taking opioids after a back injury in his 20s. “For me, that worked, but then I made the realization that if I were able to take a couple more, it would cure emotional pain, along with the physical pain,” he said. “If you suffer from it, talk about it. Let it be known, because that is why we are all here helping. We know it exists, we know it’s real, and you are not less-than because we have it.” At the time, Shaheen said she wanted more funding for programs to help student athletes fight addiction issues. Shaheen said in a statement Monday: “Granite Staters seeking recovery from substance use disorders put their trust in Mr. Hatch and it’s incredibly disappointing to see how badly that trust was betrayed. He needs to be held accountable.” Less than a month ago, Hatch took part in a roundtable with retired Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc, who may face a three-way primary to take on Shaheen. He told the group he has been in recovery for 13 years. The campaign said he did not meet one-on-one with Bolduc. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Gov. Jay Inslee signed into law the nation’s first public option. | M. Scott Mahaskey/ 2020 elections By DAN GOLDBERG 07/28/2019 07:02 AM EDT Updated 07/28/2019 10:15 AM EDT Jay Inslee is running for president as the climate change candidate. But the two-term Washington governor can credibly claim to have accomplished more than most of his peers on health care, a key issue in the 2020 campaign. He created both the nation’s first public option and universal long-term care benefit — albeit a limited one — has run a successful Obamacare market, and expanded reproductive rights. His administration has also pushed forward a new plan for controlling drug costs, expanded Medicaid coverage to transgender patients and added programs for school children aimed at preventing chronic diseases later in life. In another time, Inslee would be running on his health care record, his campaign said. But not now. Inslee, who is among the many Democratic presidential candidates in the crowded field struggling to crack 1 percent in the polls, said he doesn’t have any second thoughts about staking his long-shot bid on tackling climate change, even if that overshadows his health policy accomplishments. \"Those things … become relatively moot if the entire ecosystem collapses on which human life depends,” Inslee told  earlier this month. “This is a unique issue. It is unique because our survival literally depends upon it.” The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage.

But by declaring himself the climate change candidate, Inslee may be missing a chance to define himself on health care, an issue that’s divided the Democratic field. The front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, has promoted a government-run public option that would preserve the private insurance system, while Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” plan that would virtually abolish private insurance has animated progressives. While the debate for now is about what could be done, Inslee can boast he actually got something done. “I respect everybody’s goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate that’s actually advanced the ball,” Inslee said during the first 2020 primary debate last month. In May, Inslee signed into law the nation’s first public option, set to go live next fall. Under the plan, the Inslee administration will contract with a private insurer to sell coverage on the state’s Affordable Care Act exchange. The state projects that premiums in the public plan will be 5 to 10 percent cheaper that alternatives because of capped payments to doctors and hospitals. That might not translate into a major enrollment boost, and it remains to be seen whether enough providers will participate in the plan. Inslee also signed legislation making Washington the first state to add a guaranteed long-term care benefit, addressing a growing challenge for an aging population. The law, which in concept is similar to Social Security, creates a payroll tax to offer a $100-per-day allowance for nursing home care, in-home assistance or another community-based option. It’s not enough to fully fund nursing home care, which can top $100,000 per year, but it may ease some financial pressure on families. “These two bills are models for the rest of the nation to consider,” Inslee said after signing the legislation.

Still, Inslee believes his focus on climate change will attract voters to his campaign, even though time is running out to break into the upper tier of candidates. It's unclear, though, how much his run has shaped the primary debate about climate change. Polls show it was already among Democratic voters' top priorities, and the candidates all agree with the scientific consensus that climate change is a man-made crisis demanding urgency. What the governor does deserve credit for, environmental advocates said, is raising the bar for what constitutes an acceptable response to climate change. Inslee has proposed a comprehensive plan that is more detailed than the \"Green New Deal,\" the aggressive climate change-fighting blueprint from progressives that's been vilified by Republicans. Inslee would move the United States to 100 percent clean energy by 2030, backed by a $3 trillion federal investment that would create millions of jobs. “He gets credit for raising the level of policy ambition,” said John Noel, senior climate campaigner for Greenpeace. “If you look at the platforms of the other candidates running, the baseline for climate policy is much higher.” Inslee’s campaign knows his health care record isn’t getting much attention, but it said that’s by design to highlight the urgency needed to address climate change. Inslee said he learned the importance of setting presidential priorities while serving in the House during President Barack Obama’s first term. He said there was little chance for climate change legislation to pass during Obama’s first term — the House had approved legislation capping greenhouse gas emissions in 2009, but it died in the Senate — because the ACA, which became law in March 2010, sucked up all the oxygen in Washington. “In any normal year, at any normal time, he would have run on the major progressive achievements he has achieved in Washington state,” said Jamal Raad, Inslee’s communications director. “But we are at a tipping point. The leadership of the next president matters in terms of the climate crisis.” Should Inslee break through in the polls, though, his health care record could get a closer look. Inslee in the past few months has taken measures to address top concerns among voters, including high drug prices and health care costs.

In February, Washington became the second state to propose a new payment system to vastly expand access to pricey hepatitis C medications. Under the system, which proponents have likened to the Netflix subscription model, Washington state will pay drugmakers a lump sum for an unlimited supply of the treatment for patients covered by state health care programs. There are roughly 30,000 people living with hepatitis C who are covered by the state, according to the state Health Department. Inslee signed legislation in May meant to protect patients from “surprise” medical bills, a bipartisan issue that other states have tried to address in recent years. It's also one of the most pressing health care items on Congress' agenda this year. “There’s not a single thing Democrats are talking about nationally that we haven’t done in some form in Washington state,” said Democratic state Sen. David Frockt, who sponsored the public option bill. Washington state Rep. Joe Schmick, the top Republican on the state House Health Care Committee, noted there’s been areas of bipartisan cooperation on health care, including on surprise bills and mental health. But he remains concerned that the public option — an idea opposed by the GOP — will push out competition from private insurers. He's also worried that the state hasn’t done enough to increase access to doctors in rural areas, where health care costs are typically higher. “Just because you have insurance doesn’t mean you are going to see providers,” he said. As the Trump administration has sought to curtail access to abortion, Inslee in March signed legislation making Washington state one of the few to require insurers to cover abortion alongside maternity care. Bob Crittenden, who was a senior health policy adviser to Inslee, said Inslee has the credentials to tout his health care accomplishments as models for the nation. “If I were running his communications, I would have done it differently,” Crittenden said.

By JENNIFER HABERKORN 12/02/2015 06:48 PM EST Senate Democrats plan to force a vote on keeping guns out of the hands of people convicted of violating laws protecting the entrances of health care clinics. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has introduced the amendment, which would ban gun ownership by people who have been convicted of misdemeanors under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, a 1994 law meant to prevent violence and harassment at abortion clinics. The bill is a clear response to last week’s shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, where three people were killed and nine were injured. Reid is expected to force a vote on the amendment during consideration of the Republicans’ Obamacare repeal bill, which would use the complex budget reconciliation process to eliminate major parts of the health law.

        "articles": "\"There is no other way to say it — AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake,\" AT&T's CEO said. | Getty “There is no other way to say it — AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake,” Randall Stephenson told employees. By STEVEN OVERLY and ELI OKUN 05/11/2018 10:14 AM EDT Updated 05/11/2018 04:33 PM EDT The chief executives of AT&T and Novartis are both in damage control mode for their dealings with Michael Cohen, apologizing to employees for poor judgment in paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to President Donald Trump's personal attorney for insights into the president's thinking. AT&T also announced Friday that its top public policy official is retiring amid the furor, which it acknowledged has hurt its reputation in Washington. The fallout showed no signs of letting up as details continued dribbling out about the arrangements both companies made with Cohen, a longtime Trump fixer with no known policy chops. Cohen billed himself as a political consultant who could offer advice on how the new administration and its top officials think — and at a time when the new president’s policy positions were largely unknown, the companies shelled out big bucks for guidance. Now they’re publicly regretting that decision. \"There is no other way to say it — AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake,\" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told employees Friday. Similarly, Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan wrote in a Thursday email: “We made a mistake in entering into this engagement and, as a consequence, are being criticized by a world that expects more from us.” The mea culpas cap off a week that has been something of a public relations nightmare for AT&T and Novartis. The massive corporations found themselves thrust into the political drama surrounding Cohen, who is under criminal investigation for his business dealings. Both companies acknowledged earlier this week that special counsel Robert Mueller requested information from them late last year regarding Cohen as part of an ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The companies said they fully cooperated with investigators. Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Novartis is also now facing congressional scrutiny, with Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asking on Friday for the drug company to hand over documents about its business arrangement with Cohen. “Novartis paid Mr. Cohen hundreds of thousands dollars more than it paid its big-shot lobbyists in Washington,\" Wyden said. \"The American public needs to know who at the company signed off on this scheme and what were they expecting in return.\" The steady drip of revelations started Tuesday when Michael Avenatti, a lawyer representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels, published bank records showing payments from a handful of clients to Cohen's shell company, Essential Consultants LLC. Avenatti contends that Cohen used funds from the consulting firm to pay Daniels $130,000 before the 2016 election to stay quiet about an alleged past affair with the president. AT&T paid Cohen $600,000 for strategic advice in 2017 on its $85 billion merger with Time Warner, which Trump has opposed since it was first announced, as well as policy issues like net neutrality and tax reform. Documents obtained by  show Cohen had a yearlong contract starting just days after Trump's inauguration. Whatever advice or access AT&T got from Cohen may not have fully delivered the results the company was looking for. It scored wins on net neutrality and tax reform, where Trump administration priorities aligned with big business and the GOP establishment. But Trump’s Justice Department still sued to block the Time Warner deal last year. Meanwhile, Novartis coughed up $1.2 million in a 12-month contract in an attempt to gain insight into the Trump administration's health care plans. The drugmaker has said Cohen did not deliver as promised, but it was stuck in the contract and continued to make payments. Indeed, Cohen has not worked in health care, telecommunications or any other policy area. He is, however, close to Trump. That has led some people to surmise that the companies turned to Cohen for access to the upper echelons of the White House rather than expert guidance. Both companies have denied that Cohen lobbied Trump on their behalf. Rudy Giuliani, one of the president's newest lawyers, told  on Friday that he also doesn't believe Cohen talked directly to Trump about his corporate clients. “I don’t believe that's at all possible,\" Giuliani said. \"I don’t think it happened. If it did it, I’m sure it didn’t work.” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Friday sought to dismiss any claims of impropriety around the situation. She singled out the Justice Department's suit to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger. White House By THEODORIC MEYER, BEN WHITE and LORRAINE WOELLERT “I think it's pretty clear that the Department of Justice opposed the merger, and so certainly the president has not been influenced or his administration influenced by any outside special interests,\" Sanders told reporters. “This is actually the definition of draining the swamp, something the president talked about repeatedly during the campaign.\" Stephenson maintains the firm's actions were a \"serious misjudgment\" but still above board. AT&T said Cohen did not offer to arrange any meetings with Trump administration officials, instead billing himself as offering insight into \"key players, their priorities, and how they think.\" \"To be clear, everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate,\" Stephenson said. Nevertheless, the telecom giant's top public policy official, Bob Quinn, will retire following the week's news, a sign of the damage that hiring Cohen has inflicted on the firm's reputation in Washington. AT&T's public policy shop will report to general counsel David McAtee for \"the foreseeable future.\" \"David's number one priority is to ensure every one of the individuals and firms we use in the political arena are people who share our high standards and who we would be proud to have associated with AT&T,\" he continued. Narasimhan said he knew employees were likely “disappointed and frustrated.” The arrangement was set up before Narasimhan took over as CEO in February. “Personally and for my family, yesterday was also a difficult day, as unfounded stories spread through the US news. While I was not involved with any aspect of this situation, the facts did not matter. I went to sleep frustrated and tired,” Narasimhan wrote. “But I woke up this morning full of determination.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI 01/16/2017 06:52 AM EST The 2016 primary fight continues to divide the party, hindering Democrats’ ability to unite and prompting national party leaders to tiptoe around the issue. | Getty The Hillary Clinton vs. Bernie Sanders rift is bubbling up in gubernatorial primaries. It’s pulsing through the race for Democratic National Committee chairman, and shaping state party leadership contests from Hawaii to Maine. Long after the Democratic presidential nomination was settled, the bruising 2016 primary fight continues to divide the party, hindering Democrats’ ability to unite and prompting national party leaders to tiptoe around the issue in the hopes of avoiding an outbreak of Sanders-Clinton proxy wars. The bitter defeat at the hands of Donald Trump has exacerbated the tensions, leading to the rise of “Bernie would have won” and “Bernie’s challenge helped sink Hillary” camps, even if the battles are rarely framed in such explicit terms. Now, with the chairmanship of the DNC and party nominations in multiple 2017 races at stake, some Democrats are desperately trying to strike a balance and remind rank-and-file activists of the real enemy. “The old-fashioned way to do this is to purge the party, but that’s not the way things work anymore,” said former Vermont governor and DNC chairman Howard Dean, who himself passed on a second run for the chairmanship in December specifically because he was worried about the prospect of an overly divisive race. “The party can’t win if it’s not inclusive, and the way to be inclusive is not to re-litigate the old battle. And there’s obviously some attempt to do that.\" “There are some people who are itching to have this fight,” Dean, a 2004 presidential candidate and 2016 Clinton backer, added. “I think it’s silly, and I think they’re going to lose.\" The Clinton vs. Sanders narrative is already coloring the DNC chair race, despite the strenuous efforts of each of the declared candidates to downplay it: the candidates are clear in their stump speeches about their wish to avoid a redux of their primary fight, and some campaigns have drawn up internal memos and circulated talking points describing how their candidate bridges the divide. Presidential Transition By DANIEL LIPPMAN The Sanders wing’s preferred candidate, Rep. Keith Ellison, has repeatedly gone out of his way to frame himself as the “unity” candidate against his main opponent, Labor Secretary Tom Perez, a top Clinton surrogate in 2016 who has been flexing his own progressive muscles to appeal to the party’s left wing. To Ellison — one of Sanders’ first endorsers before becoming a prominent Clinton surrogate — the common reading of his race as a Clinton-Sanders proxy war has been a source of frustration, according to people who have spoken with him in recent weeks. As such, the Minnesotan and his team have worked to make “unity” a buzzword in his campaign, and his courtship conversations with DNC members are often peppered with his descriptions of work he did for Clinton as well as Sanders. To underscore the point, the raft of endorsements he unveiled in the early days of the campaign was packed not only with Sanders backers, but prominent Clinton surrogates like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. Perez, who drew mention as a dark horse vice-presidential pick for Clinton, often avoids talking about the 2016 race on the trail, preferring to spin the conversation forward — his campaign website, for example, contains no mention of Clinton or Sanders, instead leaning on President Barack Obama, a universally popular figure in the party. Asked about parallels between the DNC race and the Democratic presidential primary, Perez begged off, declining to use the names Sanders or Clinton. \"This race is about the future of the Democratic Party, how we move forward together to address the existential threats, frankly, that Donald Trump presents to this nation,\" he said. \"I've worked very closely with everybody in every wing of the party because I've fought a lot of fights side-by-side with them. The big tent of the Democratic Party is our greatest strength.\" At the party's first forum for chair candidates on Saturday, the need to avoid a primary fight redux was front-and-center. \"I am not interested in re-litigating the 2016 primary. We've all been through that,\" said South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a contender who jumped into the race by explicitly promising to circumvent such a battle. \"As was said before, Donald J. Trump will be president of the United States in a week. We don't have time to re-litigate 2016.\" \"People ask me, 'Are you a Clinton Democrat or a Bernie Democrat? Guys, I grew up in South Carolina, and all I've ever been is a Democrat,\" added South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison, another candidate. There are obvious incentives for Perez and Ellison, both noted liberals, to stay out of the presidential fight. Some Clinton backers have laid into Ellison for the Sanders criticisms that they think ultimately cost the former secretary of state the race. Some of the Vermont senator's supporters have accused Perez of abandoning progressive principles altogether over his support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade program. The cabinet secretary is aware of his need to win over skeptical liberals, while the congressman knows he has to prove his team player credentials to establishment Democrats who make up most of the DNC voting base. Politics By ANNIE KARNI “Everyone wants to make it a big surrogate race for Hillary and Bernie. But it’s got nothing to do with Hillary and Bernie,” insisted former California Governor Gray Davis, a longtime Clinton ally. “The DNC should stop seeing itself as a debating society and the face of the party, and more as the infrastructure of the party.\" But the divide isn’t simply a Democratic primary rehash. It’s also about ideology, as ascendant progressives aligned with Sanders look to place Clinton’s establishment-oriented liberalism in the rear-view mirror. Some Sanders allies are eager to see a version of the debate burst into the open on a national scale after a handful of his acolytes scored victories in recent races for state party chairmanships. In Virginia, many Democrats expect former Rep. Tom Perriello — hardly a Sanders-style liberal — to shift to his left to embrace Sanders backers in his gubernatorial primary against Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, who hails from the party’s moderate wing. In New Jersey, advisors of former ambassador, DNC finance chair, and Goldman Sachs banker Phil Murphy are eager to portray him as the progressive outsider in his New Jersey gubernatorial primary race against two state lawmakers — one of whom has a Sanders alum running his campaign. Even New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent target of liberals, appeared with Sanders to unveil a debt-free college proposal earlier this month, as he approaches his 2018 re-election campaign. Sanders himself has been more focused on his Senate work than on party politics. And on Capitol Hill, no Clinton-Sanders proxy fights have yet broken out in a place full of Clinton allies and comparatively few Sanders backers.The senator’s confidants are careful not to look either bitter or triumphant — “We wouldn’t frame anything as Bernie-Clinton,” said Larry Cohen, the board chairman of Our Revolution, the successor group to Sanders’ campaign — but his supporters aren’t shy in invoking his name. And they’re already taking Sanders’ so-called political revolution to the states: while Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett — a Clinton super delegate — managed to stave off a Sanders-inspired challenge, another Sanders backer, Tim Vandeveer, captured Hawaii’s party chairmanship. Fights are now brewing in more than roughly half a dozen other states as other Sanders supporters look to replace entrenched state party leaders. There's Iowa, where Our Revolution has endorsed a candidate, and Washington, where Sanders backers are furiously working to challenge incumbent chairman Jaxon Ravens. Similar stories are unfolding in Wisconsin, Florida, and Wyoming. \"Which state is next?\" is a frequent topic of conversation among the remaining chairs. Presidential Transition By TARA PALMERI “It’s not necessarily the Bernie versus Hillary wings of the party. There is this grassroots movement voters’ arm of the party, and the more corporate, institutional part of the party. And the movement arm is tired of the institutional part telling us the only place for us is in the streets,” said Nebraska Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kleeb, a Sanders and Ellison supporter who was elected in June in another race with clear Clinton-Sanders fault lines. \"We are saying no, because you’re losing elections with only corporate, institutional folks at the table. We deserve a seat at the table also.\" \"Senator Sanders is so vocal in the public and online, so of course in the grassroots we use him as an example and institutional Democrats use Clinton as an example,” she explained. \"So, of course, he looms large. And he should.\" With three more official candidate forums and scores of local party gatherings with the candidates planned before the late February DNC chair election, the campaigns are aware the coming weeks are more likely than not to bring up some of the messier flash points from 2016. “It might take a few more months” before tensions cool, acknowledged Wyoming Democratic Party Chairwoman Ana Cuprill, a candidate for DNC secretary who has come under local fire for her role as a Clinton super-delegate, and who is up for re-election in April. “With the inauguration coming up, there are going to be a lot of really torn-up folks dealing with those emotions from November.\" Anna Palmer and Daniel Strauss contributed to this report.

        "articles": "'Get rid of the MD asap,' Walker replied in an email about the doctor. By NATALIE VILLACORTA 02/20/2014 09:06 AM EST Emails released Wednesday reveal that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker might have been behind the firing of a woman because she was a former thong model. Walker’s chief of staff at the time, Thomas Nardelli, informed him of a doctor at the Milwaukee County Behavior Health Division who had a “checkered past” and had worked as a model, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. “It isn’t pornographic,” Nardelli wrote, according to a copy of the email reported by the Huffington Post. “[But] it is quite suggestive (I’m told - I don’t know her name). He [sic] apparently models thongs and wasn’t forthright in sharing that with staff prior to her hire as an hourly paid MD at [Behavioral Health Division].” ( QUIZ: How well do you know Scott Walker?) Though the email said she was competent, the division’s director was looking for a way to dismiss her “without much fanfare” because he was concerned the staff would discover her “other life,” he explained. “Get rid of the MD asap,” Walker replied. The emails are among the some 27,000 from a former Walker aide who is appealing her conviction of misconduct in office that a court ordered become public Wednesday. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "The editorial board says Cruz has failed to live up to their expectations. By TAL KOPAN 10/16/2013 08:34 AM EDT The Houston Chronicle editorial board expressed remorse over its endorsement of Sen. Ted Cruz in the Senate race last year, saying he has failed to live up to their expectations. “When we endorsed Ted Cruz in last November’s general election, we did so with many reservations and at least one specific recommendation - that he follow Hutchison’s example in his conduct as a senator. Obviously, he has not done so. Cruz has been part of the problem in specific situations where Hutchison would have been part of the solution,” the Texas paper board wrote in an editorial titled, “ Why we miss Kay Bailey Hutchison”. The Chronicle lamented the retirement of Cruz’s predecessor in the Senate, saying she may have made a difference in the government shutdown were she still in the Senate. “We’re not sure how much difference one person could make in the toxic, chaotic, hyperpartisan atmosphere in Washington, but if we could choose just one it would be Hutchison, whose years of service in the Senate were marked by two things sorely lacking in her successor, Ted Cruz,” the Chronicle wrote, citing her putting the best interests of Texas above all else and her willingness to work across the aisle. “We feel certain she would have worked shoulder to shoulder with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in crafting a workable solution that likely would have avoided the government shutdown altogether. But we’ll never know.” ( WATCH: Ted Cruz seizes Senate floor) Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for  Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox. © 2021  LLC",

        "articles": "“This is just another politically motivated attack on the VP by a left-wing organization closely aligned with the Democratic Party,” said Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary, Alyssa Farah. | Karel Navarro/AP Photo Pence could increasingly find himself the target of liberal attacks in a midterm election year. By MATTHEW NUSSBAUM 04/19/2018 05:02 AM EDT A leading progressive group is launching a campaign-style effort to paint Vice President Mike Pence as an extremist who wields unprecedented power in the White House — an early sign that as the vice president takes a lead role in midterm campaigning, he also risks making himself a target. The Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBT rights organization, is launching a sustained attack against Pence, with a website, videos and a lengthy report to be released on Thursday. The materials were shown to  early. The attack from a key player in the Democratic base comes as Pence is campaigning heavily for Republicans ahead of the 2018 midterms. And as President Donald Trump’s legal troubles expand, from the special counsel probe to a federal investigation of his personal attorney, some Democrats are beginning to train their fire on Pence in case the president doesn’t run for reelection in 2020 or gets removed from office. “Mike Pence has made a career out of attacking the rights and equal dignity of LGBTQ people, women and other marginalized communities,” Chad Griffin, the president of HRC, said in a statement. “Now as vice president, he poses one of the greatest threats to equality in the history of our movement. With the world distracted by Donald Trump’s scandal-ridden White House, Mike Pence’s nefarious agenda has been allowed to fly under the radar for too long. He has become not only the most powerful vice president in American history, but also the least scrutinized.” “This is just another politically motivated attack on the VP by a left-wing organization closely aligned with the Democratic Party,” said Pence press secretary Alyssa Farah. Internally, the Vice President’s office was largely dismissive of the campaign. The broadside comes as Pence has taken on an outsize role in the Republicans’ work to prevent a Democratic wave in 2018. In the next week and a half, Pence will be making campaign stops in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Indiana and California. Those trips come after Pence has already crisscrossed the country stumping and fundraising for Republicans. As Pence becomes a more visible part of the administration, Democrats have another incentive to lash out at him: cash. “I think the most likely thing here is that Pence is an easy target for the Human Rights Campaign to raise money from,” said Republican strategist Rick Tyler, who served as communications director for Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential run. “Every special interest group, and Human Rights Campaign is not alone, has a boogeyman, and theirs is Mike Pence.” The HRC effort highlights what it describes as Pence’s “extremist ideology”: his opposition while in Congress to Employment Non-Discrimination Act protections for sexual orientation; his opposition to ending “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” which barred openly gay people from serving in the military; his opposition to hate crime protections for transgender individuals; and a statement on his 2000 campaign website that appeared to endorse federal funding for the controversial practice of “conversion therapy.” The report, which highlights these positions, also hits Pence for his handling of an HIV/AIDS outbreak in Indiana during his governorship and for signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics said would legalize discrimination against LGBT people and which nearly derailed his governorship.

Along with the report, HRC produced a series of videos, including one in which Pence decries the use of condoms and another in which he lobbies against hate-crime legislation. The videos feature ominous background music and black-and-white images of a malevolent-looking Pence. Clips of Pence speaking on the floor of the House — including one in which he says, “Abstinence and marital faithfulness before condom distribution are the cure for what ails the families of Africa” — are spliced in. Pence is one of the more popular members of the administration, said HRC’s Charlotte Clymer, who helped draft the report, adding that Pence has received “less scrutiny” than other White House figures. “We’ve seen Mike Pence fly underneath the radar,” said Chris Sgro, HRC’s communications director. “The unfortunate reality is that Mike Pence has tried to hold himself out there as the moderate, grown-up voice in the room. But we know, and this report exposes, that he’s anything but. He is a dangerous extremist.” Tyler said even if HRC and other groups beat up on Pence as November approaches, he believes voters are more likely to make ballot-box decisions based on their views of Trump. “When [House Speaker Paul] Ryan announced he wasn’t running for reelection, that was in many ways the end of the Republican Party the way I knew it and the way Ryan knew it,” Tyler said. “The cord is severed, this is now Trump’s party, for better or worse, for good or bad, and 2018 is now a referendum on his party.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Antonin Scalia pauses as he addresses a Northern Virginia Technology Council meeting on Dec. 3, 2006 in McLean, Virginia. | Getty Cases on the docket could alter American life on many issues. By  PRO STAFF 02/13/2016 09:24 PM EST Updated 02/13/2016 10:07 PM EST Justice Antonin Scalia’s death could change the course of history on the contentious social and legal issues pending before the Supreme Court this term, especially in closely divided cases where he was expected to serve as a lynchpin of a conservative majority. In cases where the eight remaining justices are evenly divided, appeals court rulings would be left to stand, but no precedent would be set for future cases. The justices could also hold cases and leave stays of lower court rulings in place, while awaiting confirmation of a new justice, but it’s unclear if they would do so for nearly a year if the Senate refuses to consider any nominee while President Barack Obama is in office. Here are policy areas that hang in the balance: Abortion Many Texas abortion clinics could close, an outcome that may have happened anyway with Scalia on the court. The court next month will hear the most significant abortion case since 1992, when the justices ruled states could legally impose restrictions on abortion that did not put an “undue burden” on access to the procedure. This term’s abortion case, which centers on restrictions Texas placed on providers and clinics, will again test how far states can go to limit abortion. The court is expected to be divided along familiar partisan lines, with Justice Anthony Kennedy serving as a possible swing vote. A 4-4 decision in the case, Whole Woman’s Health v. Cole, would leave in place a lower court ruling that upheld the restrictions on clinics. Health care Religious nonprofits, including charities, schools, colleges and hospitals, may have to live with the decisions of seven appeals courts, which ruled against their challenge to the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate. The plaintiffs in Zubik v. Burwell, including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington and the Little Sisters of the Poor, argue that both the law’s requirement that employers provide female employees with health insurance that includes no-cost access to certain forms of birth control -- and the government’s work-around set up for religious nonprofits -- violate their religious freedom. Appeals courts decided the cases against them largely because the administration offered them the work-around the Supreme Court sought in an earlier case, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, in 2014. The case pits questions of religious liberty against a woman’s right to equal health-care access, and it will be the fourth time the court has considered some aspect of what has come to be known as Obamacare. Unions Public sector-unions may get a reprieve. Until Saturday, unions for state and local government employees were bracing themselves for what appeared an all-but-certain 5-4 ruling against them in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, a case challenging the legality of \"fair share\" fees that the unions charge nonmembers to cover costs associated with collective bargaining. In effect, government employee unions were looking at a court-imposed \"right-to-work\" regime. Scalia was the swing vote in the case, given his prior support for fair-share fees. But in court arguments last month Scalia's line of questioning left the strong impression that his sympathies had swung to the plaintiffs' side, giving them a likely 5-4 majority. With Scalia's death, the court is now likely to split 4-4, thereby affirming the Ninth Circuit's previous decision against the plaintiffs and in favor of fair share fees. Affirmative action: The use of affirmative action in college admissions could survive a challenge. In Fisher v. University of Texas, Justice Elena Kagan had recused herself, introducing the possibility of a 4-4 outcome that would have no wide effect. A lower court has upheld the university’s use of race as a factor in admissions. During oral arguments in December, Scalia angered some with his echoing of a conservative critique of affirmative action: that it shortchanges minorities by putting them into an environment where they cannot perform as well as other students. \"There are those who contend [such programs] do not benefit African-Americans,\" he said, adding that \"blacks\" may do better at \"less-advanced, slower-track schools.\" Separation of church and state Religious schools could continue to be denied publicly funded grants. Last month, the nation's highest court agreed to hear a case about whether the separation of church and state really meant it was unconstitutional for a Lutheran church preschool in Missouri to be denied state grant money for recycled tire material to make its playground safer. The case, Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Pauley has the potential to affect several states, where such Blaine amendments have been the legal argument for preventing school voucher programs that send tax dollars to private, religious schools. Colorado struck down a local voucher program last year on those grounds, as has the Florida Supreme Court. Scalia, along with Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy had indicated a willingness to accept the argument that banning state lawmakers from funding religious schools, if a democratic majority wants to, would impede the free exercise of religion. Climate change Obama’s Clean Power Plan could be in the hands of the D.C. Circuit Court. One of Scalia's last official acts as a justice was to deliver a large dent in Obama's climate legacy, providing one of five votes to stay the Clean Power Plan, which regulates carbon emissions from power plants. The decision could set back implementation of the rule by years. A 4-4 ideological split on the Supreme Court raises the stakes for the more liberal D.C. Circuit's eventual decision on the Clean Power Plan, though the high court would still have to lift its stay if the rule is upheld. Immigration Scalia’s death might not have a big impact on one of the most significant cases the court has agreed to take up: a challenge to Obama’s latest round of executive actions on immigration. That case is expected to be argued in April. Five votes will be needed to sustain Obama’s moves to use executive branch authority to allow up to five million more immigrants to apply for quasi-legal status and work permits. The court’s Democratic appointees are expected to back his move. If the administration can win the vote of Justice Anthony Kennedy or Chief Justice John Roberts, Obama will be able to move forward with his actions before leaving office. If not, the program will remain blocked. However, Scalia’s absence from the court would likely prevent a definitive, precedential ruling against presidential authority to make moves similar to Obama’s. A similar effort by a future president could be re-litigated, presumably reaching the court once Scalia’s replacement is in place. — With contributions from Carol Eisenberg, Josh Gerstein, Alex Guillen, Brian Mahoney, Jason Millman and Nirvi Shah SCOTUS By JOSH GERSTEIN On The Bench By RICHARD PRIMUS By BURGESS EVERETT and GLENN THRUSH Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez speaks during the general session of the DNC winter meeting in Atlanta on Feb. 25. | AP Photo The former Labor secretary immediately moved to unify the party by naming Keith Ellison as his deputy chairman. By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI 02/25/2017 03:26 PM EST Updated 02/25/2017 09:41 PM EST ATLANTA — Tom Perez, the former labor secretary for President Barack Obama, was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday, replacing interim chair Donna Brazile after a rollicking, four-month race and a chaotic final day of voting. Party members landed on a decision on who should be in charge of Democrats’ official party apparatus after two rounds of balloting. With 218 votes necessary to win, the final tally was 235 votes for Perez and 200 votes for Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. Immediately after taking over, Perez moved to name Ellison his deputy chairman, aiming to unify a divided party. \"When we have these conversations, sometimes spirited, sometimes difficult, that's not a sign of weakness, that's a sign of strength as a party, and that's what we're going to keep doing,” Perez said. “If you came here supporting me, wearing a Keith T-shirt, or any T-shirt, I’m asking you to give everything you’ve got to support Chairman Perez,” said Ellison, accepting the role. “You love this country, you love all the people in it, you care about each and every one of them, urban, rural, suburban, all cultures, all faiths, everybody, and they are in need of your help. And if we waste even a moment going at it over who supported who, we are not going to be standing up for those people. We don’t have the luxury, folks, to walk out of this room divided.\" The result came after Perez came within one vote of winning in the first round, garnering 213.5 votes of the needed 214.5, while Ellison won 200. Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown received 12 votes, then dropped out before the second round. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the race — in which members of the Democrats Abroad group get half a vote each — just minutes before voting began. Three other candidates captured no support. By AUSTIN WRIGHT The paper-ballot vote at a conference center here comes after months of tense campaigning that has convulsed a party desperate to avoid a redux of 2016’s Hillary Clinton-Bernie Sanders primary fight. But that hope was dashed as nerves rose ahead of the election — the party’s first contested chairmanship fight in at least three decades, which saw many prominent Democrats picking sides. While Perez touted endorsements from former Obama administration officials like Vice President Joe Biden, former Attorney General Eric Holder, and former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Ellison had the backing of prominent senators including Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer. Tensions exploded on the floor Saturday as members of Ellison’s team sent voting members text messages during the first-round voting process claiming an endorsement from Buttigieg — which Buttigieg then rebutted on Twitter. Only after voting closed did Ellison forces text out a correction. As the second round of voting finished, Ellison’s team circulated a last-second endorsement from former Chairman Howard Dean, feeling the need to clarify “This is real.\" When Perez won, Ellison backers erupted in anger, chanting “Party of the people, not big money!” But that fury turned to relief and big smiles as Ellison took the deputy chairman title. Buttigieg, seen as a rising voice in the party, had the backing of five former chairs, including Dean. But he used his nominating speech to leave the race, having raised his profile but also having determined the votes simply weren’t there for him to win. The election closes a tumultuous chapter for the party committee, which was rocked last summer by a Russian hack and publication of internal emails. The exposed emails were widely viewed as evidence that some DNC staffers favored Clinton over Sanders in the presidential primary, inflaming that race. The resulting controversy saw the ouster of the longtime chair, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, at the party convention in July. Both Perez and Ellison sought to present themselves as unity candidates, but Perez was widely seen as the candidate representing the Obama-Clinton wing of the party, and Ellison as the candidate of the Sanders wing. Buttigieg and others sought to present themselves as an alternative path forward, but the party’s deep divisions nonetheless defined much of the race. “We are one family, and I know we will leave here united today, no doubt about that,” said Perez shortly before the vote. “I've learned that great leaders are good listeners. You will always have my ear, and I will always have your back.\" “Unity is essential; we’ve got to walk out of here with unity. Not just between the candidates, but between the groups that support all the candidates,” added Ellison just minutes later, speaking to a room that included scores of members of the public wearing his campaign’s green T-shirts. “We’ve got to walk out of here hand in hand, brother and sister, because Trump is right outside the door. Not just Trump, but Trumpism.\" Saturday’s vote came after days of high-wire politicking in Atlanta, as both of the major campaigns had surrogates campaigning and whipping votes for them — from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s work for Ellison to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s work for Perez. Both of the major campaigns also consolidated support from other candidates in the closing days, with New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley dropping out to endorse Ellison and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison exiting the race to throw his support behind Perez. While Perez and Ellison both worked voting members at the bar and hotel meeting rooms in the closing days, however, fears rose of a continued rift within the party — particularly from backers of Sanders and Ellison nervous about the prospect of a Perez victory. 2016 By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI Ellison’s team sought to calm such fears in public, selecting American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten — a onetime Clinton surrogate — to help nominate him. But the concerns ratcheted up on Saturday morning as the committee fought over whether to reinstate Obama’s ban on corporate and lobbyist donations, with many of the ban’s proponents wearing Ellison shirts and buttons. The reinstatement of the ban was tabled for later discussion, yet the tone was set. Looking to meddle in Democratic affairs, President Donald Trump weighed in with a tweet on Saturday afternoon, needling Perez: \"Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!\" Seeking to move the party ahead, Sanders issued a statement congratulating Perez shortly after the results were announced. \"I congratulate Tom Perez on his election as chairman of the Democratic National Committee and look forward to working with him,” he said, a break from his earlier warnings that a vote for Perez would be a vote for the party’s status quo. \"At a time when Republicans control the White House, the U.S. House, U.S. Senate and two-thirds of all statehouses, it is imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same-old is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before. Now, more than ever, the Democratic Party must make it clear that it is prepared to stand up to the 1 percent and lead this country forward in the fight for social, racial, economic and environmental justice.\" Obama also released a statement on the results. \"What unites our party is a belief in opportunity — the idea that however you started out, whatever you look like, or whomever you love, America is the place where you can make it if you try,\" he said. \"I know that Tom Perez will unite us under that banner of opportunity, and lay the groundwork for a new generation of Democratic leadership for this big, bold, inclusive, dynamic America we love so much.\" Democrats also voted for other new leaders on Saturday. Filling the vice chair slots will be Louisiana Democratic Party chair and state Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, union official Maria Elena Durazo, New York Rep. Grace Meng and Bronx Assemblyman Michael Blake. New York financier Bill Derrough was elected treasurer, and Wisconsin member Jason Rae will serve as secretary. Henry Muñoz III was reelected as the party’s national finance chairman after running unopposed. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "white house \"I have news for everybody: Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy,\" the acting White House chief of staff told reporters. By QUINT FORGEY 10/17/2019 01:27 PM EDT Updated: 10/17/2019 06:09 PM EDT Link Copied Donald Trump's top aide on Thursday acknowledged that the administration held up military funds to Ukraine over the president's desire for a political probe, undermining past denials of any quid pro quo and blowing up weeks of White House messaging amid an escalating impeachment inquiry. In a whirlwind 40-minute news conference, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said the U.S. aid was withheld at least in part because of a request to have Ukraine investigate unfounded allegations that foreign countries assisted Democrats in the 2016 election. \"Did he also mention to me in [the] past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely,\" Mulvaney said of a conversation he had Trump. \"No question about that. But that's it, and that's why we held up the money.\" He added: \"The look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation.\" More than five hours after the briefing, the White House issued a statement attributed to Mulvaney in which he sought to walk back his earlier comments. \"Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,\" the statement said. \"Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election. The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. The only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption. \"Multiple times during the more-than 30 minute briefing where I took over 25 questions, I referred to President Trump’s interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, and ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and appropriately. There was never any connection between the funds and the Ukrainians doing anything with the server — this was made explicitly obvious by the fact that the aid money was delivered without any action on the part of the Ukrainians regarding the server. \"There never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\" The explosive remarks from the West Wing's senior staffer before reporters seemed to provoke alarm among congressional lawmakers and Trump's allies in equal measure. \"I'm starting to get worried for POTUS now,\" a person close to the Trump campaign said in a text message of Mulvaney's performance. \"Total disaster unless there's some strategy I'm not seeing.\" \"I thought it was really remarkable,\" said one former White House official, \"because it was either a huge unforced error or a calculated concession.\" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), one of the leaders of the Democratic impeachment proceedings, also offered a dour assessment. \"I think Mr. Mulvaney’s acknowledgment means that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,\" Schiff said. Pressed during the news conference on whether he was describing a quid pro quo with Ukraine, Mulvaney responded that \"we do that all the time with foreign policy,\" and cited the holding back of financial assistance to Northern Triangle countries to affect their immigration policies. \"I have news for everybody: Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy.\" Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney \"I have news for everybody: Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy,\" he said. \"That is going to happen. Elections have consequences, and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.\" Democrats have aggressively accelerated their impeachment inquiry since it was revealed that Trump urged newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to review two unsubstantiated charges: that Ukraine was somehow involved in wrongdoing involving Hillary Clinton's emails, and that Joe Biden led efforts to fire a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to protect his son's interests in the region. Although Mulvaney insisted that \"the money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden,\" Trump raised both allegations during his call with Zelensky. Mulvaney also pushed back Wednesday against a question regarding a whistleblower complaint that details alleged attempts by White House officials to \"lock down\" records of that conversation. He instead pointed to the release of a readout of the call between the two leaders — which came only after intense pressure from Congress. \"Everyone wants to believe there's a cover-up,\" he said. \"You don't give stuff to the public and say, 'Here it is,' if you're trying to cover something up.\" Several administration officials are under inspection by lawmakers for their potential roles in a campaign to pressure Ukraine's government, and Mulvaney, who still serves as director of the White House budget office, has been scrutinized regarding the stalled aid to Kyiv. \"I was involved with the process by which the money was held up temporarily, OK?\" he said. \"Three issues for that: the corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in the support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That's completely legitimate.\" The final condition Mulvaney listed appears refer to Attorney General William Barr's investigation of foreign interference in the 2016 election, which detractors have criticized as a White House-backed bid to discredit the work of former special counsel Robert Mueller.

Bernie Sanders said Sunday that President Donald Trump is \"a fraud\" and is working with Wall Street as he looks to roll back some banking regulations. \"It is hard not to laugh, to see President Trump alongside these Wall Street guys. I have to say this, Jake, and I don't mean to be disrespectful, this guy is a fraud,\" Sanders told host Jake Tapper on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Sanders criticized Trump for appointing \"all of these billionaires\" to his Cabinet, and singled out his major financial adviser, who comes from Goldman Sachs. The Vermont senator said that during his campaign, Trump said he would not cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid but \"then he appoints all of these guys who are precisely going to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\" \"Man, this guy, he's a good showman, I'll give him that. He's a good TV guy,\" said Sanders, who battled Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary before endorsing her. Sanders' campaign was based on attacking the nation's dominant financial interests and income inequality, among other things. \"I think he is going to sell out the middle class and the working class of this country,\" Sanders continued. \"He told us, in fact, it's in the Republican platform, he's going to bring back Glass-Steagall, we're going to be dividing up commercial banks from investment banks to insurance companies. Then he has all of the big Wall Street guys on his side, and now he is working for Wall Street.\" Congress By JOHN BRESNAHAN and BURGESS EVERETT Sanders, a consistent advocate for more regulations for Wall Street, also called out Trump's campaign as hypocritical. \"You have a president who, I think, in a totally fraudulent campaign said, 'I'm going to stand up for the working people.' Look at his Cabinet, we never had more billionaires in a Cabinet in the history of this country. Look at his appointees,\" he said. \"These are people who are going to go after the needs of working families, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor. That is called hypocrisy.\" Sanders said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans need to \"have the courage to stand up to Trump's movement towards authoritarianism.\" \"Many men and women of our military did not stand up and fight and die to lead us in the direction of an authoritarian society. We are a democracy, not a one-man show. We are not another Trump enterprise. It's called the United States of America. We're not a business run by Mr. Trump,\" Sanders said. Sanders also weighed in on Trump's Supreme Court nominee. He told Tapper that he fears Trump is \"moving us in a very authoritarian direction,\" mentioning how Trump criticized U.S. District Court Judge James Robart on Saturday by calling him a \"so-called judge,\" and wants to see someone fill the Supreme Court seat that will \"stand up for civil liberties.\" Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court last week. \"I want a Supreme Court that is going to stand up for civil liberties, for constitutional rights, for the rights of workers, for environmental rights, for the rights of women,\" Sanders said.

By MACKENZIE WEINGER 01/11/2012 02:48 PM EST Although the Occupy Wall Street movement has receded from the headlines, a majority of Americans said in a new poll that they see major class conflict between the rich and poor. Two-thirds of Americans said they think there are “very strong” or “strong” class conflicts in society, according to a Pew Research Center poll on Wednesday. That marks a 19 percent increase from 2009, when just 47 percent cited it as a main issue. The clash between rich and poor now ranks as American society’s greatest social conflict, pollsters found, followed by 62 percent whosaid there are very strong or strong conflicts between immigrants and native-born Americans, and 38 percent who said these conflicts exist between blacks and whites. In 2009, more Americans said there were strong conflicts between immigrants and native-born Americans than the rich and poor. And the intensity of the clash between rich and poor has grown more extreme, with 30 percent saying there are very strong conflicts in this poll compared with 15 percent who said the same in 2009. The 30 percent of Americans surveyed is the largest number recorded since the question was first asked in 1987, the pollsters said. Over half of Republicans, or 55 percent, said there are very strong or strong conflicts between the rich and the poor, and 73 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of independents agree. All those figures have shot up since 2009, when 38 percent of Republicans, 55 percent of Democrats and 45 percent of independents told pollsters they believed the same. Overall, just 23 percent of Americans said there are not very strong conflicts between the wealthy and poor and 7 percent said there are no conflicts whatsoever. The poll surveyed 2,048 adults Dec. 6-19, 2011. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "2016 Fundraising assistance in Texas flouts presidential primary neutrality rules. By BEN SCHRECKINGER 06/03/2015 05:11 AM EDT In an apparent violation of party rules requiring Democratic National Committee officers to remain neutral in presidential primaries, the DNC’s finance chairman has been raising money for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Henry R. Muñoz III, a former fundraiser for President Barack Obama who became DNC finance chairman in 2013, is helping organize a Wednesday fundraising event for Clinton in San Antonio, Texas, according to longtime Democratic operative Gilberto Ocañas and Bexar County Democratic Party Chairman Manuel Medina. “I know he’s made a few calls to raise money,” Medina said of Muñoz on Tuesday. “He’s certainly taking it upon himself to make tomorrow’s fundraiser a success.” Muñoz was also present at a Clinton campaign kickoff breakfast in San Antonio last month at which local supporters met the campaign’s national political director, Amanda Renteria, and other staff, according to Ocañas. Also on  NICK GASS DNC rules, designed to ensure all candidates get a fair shake in presidential primaries, state: “The Chairperson shall be responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and even-handedness during the Democratic Party Presidential nominating process.” DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a national co-chair and dogged surrogate for Clinton’s 2008 presidential bid, has long been viewed as on the outs with the Obama White House and closer to Clinton. A spokeswoman for the DNC declined to comment. Muñoz’s activities could contribute to a perception that the national party is already rushing ahead to promote Clinton as the nominee and prompted swift blowback from a leading adviser to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of Clinton’s rivals for the nomination. “All parties should follow their own rules,” said Sanders adviser Tad Devine. “It’s very important in the primary process that the DNC not take sides before the voters have made their decision.” Muñoz, who owns a San Antonio-based architecture firm, was a major bundler for Obama’s reelection campaign, working with Mexican-American donors in Texas. He also co-founded the Latino Victory Project — which helps to elect Latinos to public office and advocates on issues like immigration reform that are of special interest to American Latinos — with actress Eva Longoria. “For well over a decade, Henry has done all that he can to ensure that all Democrats, up and down the the ticket, are positioned for success, and would do the same for any other candidate,” wrote Muñoz’s personal spokesman, Jon Reinish, in a statement. “However, he has not donated to any campaign personally, made any endorsement or co-hosted any event as the primary process plays out.” Muñoz’s efforts on behalf of Clinton come as San Antonio’s Latino community carves out a prominent place in her political universe. Rep. Joaquín Castro has also been raising money for the Clinton campaign in San Antonio, according to Ocañas, himself a Clinton donor. He said Castro, Muñoz and Bill Clinton’s former Housing and Urban Development secretary Henry Cisneros have all been “working hard” on Clinton’s behalf. Cisneros and Muñoz have vocally supported the consideration of Castro’s brother, current HUD secretary and former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, as a candidate for the vice presidency in 2016. Also on  NICK GASS “Certainly Julian Castro deserves to be on the short list for vice president of the United States,” Muñoz told BuzzFeed last month. Also last month, in an interview with Univision, Cisneros claimed that people on Hillary Clinton’s campaign had told him that Castro was at the top of their list of potential vice presidential candidates and that “they don’t have a second option, because he is the superior candidate considering his record, personality, demeanor and Latin heritage.” In April, the Clinton campaign named another Latino from San Antonio, attorney Jose Villareal, as its treasurer. Clinton’s fundraiser will take place at 3:30 local time at San Antonio’s Club Giraud. Co-hosts, who must raise $27,000, and event hosts, who must raise $50,000, gain access to a private reception with Clinton. “We wish it was a public event,” said Medina, “but we understand she’s got a fundraising deadline real soon.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "By DANIEL STRAUSS 07/28/2015 05:24 PM EDT Sen. Bernie Sanders sees a big gaping hole in Hillary Clinton’s newly released climate-change proposals: the Keystone pipeline. “It is hard for me to understand how one can be concerned about climate change but not vigorously oppose the Keystone pipeline,” Sanders, who is challenging Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, said in a statement released on Tuesday. The statement came in response to Clinton being asked during a town-hall event in New Hampshire about her thoughts on the pipeline. Clinton demurred when asked. “This is President Obama’s decision and I’m not going to second-guess him because I was in a position to set this in motion and I do not think that would be the right thing to do,” Clinton said. That response and Sanders’ attack came a day after the former secretary of state and Democratic frontrunner unveiled her ambitious set of goals for the environment. Clinton proposed a goal of producing a third of the nation’s electricity from renewable energy from 2027 as well as installing 500 million solar panels by 2020. That wasn’t enough for Sanders, who said her proposals were a good idea but “not enough.” “We must make significant reductions in carbon emissions and break our dependency on fossil fuels,” Sanders said. “That is why I have helped lead the fight in the Senate against the Keystone pipeline, which would transport some of the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "President Donald Trump, who has thrilled social conservatives by delivering on numerous campaign promises to that constituency early in his first term, has been reluctant to wade into this particular issue, people close to him say. | Getty By TIMOTHY ALBERTA and SHANE GOLDMACHER 05/02/2017 02:50 PM EDT President Donald Trump has invited conservative leaders to the White House on Thursday for what they expect will be the ceremonial signing of a long-awaited—and highly controversial—executive order on religious liberty, according to multiple people familiar with the situation. Two senior administration officials confirmed the plan, though one cautioned that it hasn’t yet been finalized, and noted that lawyers are currently reviewing and fine-tuning the draft language. Thursday is the National Day of Prayer, and the White House was already planning to celebrate the occasion with faith leaders. The signing would represent a major triumph for Vice President Mike Pence—whose push for religious-freedom legislation backfired mightily when he served as governor of Indiana—and his allies in the conservative movement. The original draft order, which would have established broad exemptions for people and groups to claim religious objections under virtually any circumstance, was leaked to The Nation on Feb. 1—the handiwork, many conservatives believed, of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who have sought to project themselves as friendly to the LGBT community. Liberals blasted the draft order as government-licensed discrimination, and the White House distanced itself from the leaked document in a public statement. Pence and a small team of conservative allies quickly began working behind the scenes to revise the language, and in recent weeks have ratcheted up the pressure on Trump to sign it. The new draft is being tightly held, but one influential conservative who saw the text said it hasn’t been dialed back much—if at all—since the February leak. “The language is very, very strong,” the source said. By JOSH DAWSEY The president, who has thrilled social conservatives by delivering on numerous campaign promises to that constituency early in his first term, has been reluctant to wade into this particular issue, people close to him say. But the timing now appears advantageous: Thursday is not only the National Day of Prayer, it’s also the annual Canterbury Medal Gala hosted by the Becket Fund, a group that advocates for religious freedom. This year’s recipient is conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, who has played a key role in advising Trump on his selection for the Supreme Court and has pushed for the executive order in meetings with the president. Signing it this week could also lessen the sting Trump’s religious backers are feeling over the newly-approved omnibus spending bill, which keeps federal funding in place for Planned Parenthood. The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List holds its own annual gala on Wednesday, one night before the Becket Fund’s, and the news of Planned Parenthood’s continued funding has dampened some of the enthusiasm surrounding Pence’s keynote address to the event.

        "articles": "Congress “Rudy Giuliani is Donald Trump, and Donald Trump is Rudy Giuliani,” says one lawmaker. Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump. | Brian Blanco/Getty Images By ANDREW DESIDERIO and KYLE CHENEY 10/18/2019 03:20 PM EDT Updated: 10/18/2019 05:29 PM EDT Link Copied Democrats building a case for impeachment are working to prove that when it came to pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democrats, Rudy Giuliani was Donald Trump’s brain. “Rudy Giuliani is Donald Trump, and Donald Trump is Rudy Giuliani,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. After a week of depositions from key figures in the impeachment inquiry, Democrats are coalescing around a push to prove that Trump committed impeachable offenses at least partly by showing that Trump had intimate knowledge of and directed Giuliani’s plans, goals and tactics. Buttressing their strategy is a modest but intensifying public outcry among Republicans over Giuliani’s shadow diplomacy, in which the former New York City mayor sought to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and revive a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election. And it’s not just Democrats like Swalwell who represent safe liberal districts. Rep. Harley Rouda (D-Calif.), a moderate freshman whose Orange County seat Republicans are targeting, said it is clear that Trump had a deep understanding of the details of Giuliani’s Ukraine crusade. “I’m pretty sure they’re not just talking about the weather and their golf games,” Rouda quipped in a brief interview, referencing the pair’s frequent meetings and phone calls. “Especially when it’s also very clear from the evidence that President Trump directed members of the State Department to work directly with Giuliani in their efforts in Ukraine. So the nexus is there. There is no debating the facts.” Democrats say they’re beginning to see a GOP strategy developing — one that tacitly criticizes Giuliani but treats his actions in Ukraine as a rogue, one-man mission that was not specifically sanctioned by Trump. “The idea is let’s throw everyone including Rudy under the bus to protect the president,” said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.). “The cast of characters around him continue to change all the time. But there's one constant — and that constant is the source of all the chaos, and that's him.” Despite the impeachment inquiry’s laserlike focus on Giuliani, Trump has given no indication he intends to cut ties with the former New York City mayor any time soon — even if Giuliani’s actions in Ukraine become the central driver of Trump’s impeachment. “He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer,” Trump said Saturday. In contrast to his treatment of Giuliani, Trump bashed his former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen after Cohen became embroiled in legal trouble in part for work he did for the president. The break began when Cohen turned on the president, ultimately blaming his former client for landing him in prison over campaign-finance violations that prosecutors say Trump directed. But some Democrats say it’s only a matter of time until Trump treats Giuliani to the same fate. “We’ve seen this movie before, with Michael Cohen,” Rouda said. “Giuliani’s going to get thrown under the bus. The president's going to make it sound like ‘I didn’t tell him to do this or that, he was rogue, he went out on his own.’ And we all know that’s not true, but I think we can all lay a bet down on how this story ends. And that’s what you’re going to see.” Democrats seeking to substantiate Trump’s intimate involvement with Giuliani’s Ukraine efforts have been bolstered by a parade of witnesses detailing the extent to which Trump sought to run his Ukraine policy through Giuliani, who was pressing Kyiv to launch probes of Trump’s political rivals. That body of testimony is set to grow next week, when Bill Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, testifies on Tuesday, in addition to some State Department and Pentagon officials later in the week. One witness who has already testified for nine hours, Gordon Sondland, underscored the “nexus” that Democrats see between Trump and Giuliani. Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said he was ultimately “disappointed” with Trump’s desire to involve Giuliani. “It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president’s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,” Sondland told investigators, according to a copy of his opening statement obtained by . In text messages Friday, Giuliani said he couldn't discuss his private discussions with his client, Trump, but that his work on Ukraine was actually less than meets the eye -- and all done in public view. \"I was never in Ukraine at all and my investigatory work was done when it was still possible [special counsel Robert] Mueller would charge Russian collusion. Almost all of it was published in the Hill, so [Trump] and everyone else was aware of it,\" Giuliani said. \"Hardly anything not public.\" Giuliani said all of his work to unearth information on Biden was made public in April. Subsequently, he said, then-Hill columnist John Solomon \"picked it up and did much more.\" Giuliani said his actual work on Ukraine is less than it appears because the reporting on it that followed his own efforts added to the material he was collecting. \"Since the public record is more extensive than what I did, he and all of you probably think I did more than I really did,\" Giuliani said. Perhaps more importantly, though, Republicans have indicated they’re uncomfortable with Giuliani’s behavior toward Ukraine and have questioned his methods and mission. Though Trump’s allies are careful to pin any questionable conduct on Giuliani alone, Democrats see their unwillingness to defend Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine as an opening to tie potential wrongdoing to the president. Republicans, though, are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt, saying they’re not sure that the president had full awareness of Giuliani’s actions. “I don’t know if the president knew everything that Rudy was saying and doing. And if I was asked to make an assumption, I would say that he didn’t know,” said Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. But even some of the president’s closest allies have suggested that Giuliani’s involvement wasn’t above-board. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) distanced himself from the “Crowdstrike” theory that both Giuliani and Trump have pursued and amplified — the debunked assertion that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election. The Friday Cover By MICHAEL KRUSE “I’ve never been a ‘Crowdstrike’ fan,” Meadows told , adding: “I would not, on my dime, send a private attorney looking for some server in a foreign country.” But Meadows said it was understandable that Trump, who feels aggrieved that he has been investigated for ties to Russia, would listen to Giuliani. “When you get falsely accused of a number of things that are not facts, you’re willing to listen to a whole lot of things that may have been a problem,” Meadows said. But attempts by Republicans seeking to separate Trump from Giuliani were complicated Thursday when Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney declared that the White House withheld military assistance from Ukraine in part because Trump wanted assurances that the country’s new president would probe the debunked Crowdstrike matter. Mulvaney later walked back the comments. There are indications, though, that some House Republicans are beginning to question Trump’s handling of Ukraine. “It’s painful to me to see this kind of amateur diplomacy riding roughshod over our State Department apparatus,” said Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.), a former ambassador and a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Rooney on Friday indicated that he was open to supporting impeachment but is awaiting more witness interviews. “I want to get the facts and do the right thing,” he added. “Because I’ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I’m looking at anybody in this building.” Heather Caygle, Melanie Zanona and Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.

        "articles": "Photos by Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for  Magazine The Friday Cover Questions about his age have dogged the former vice president throughout the primary. By MICHAEL KRUSE October 04, 2019 Michael Kruse is a senior staff writer for . URBANDALE, Iowa â One scorching, airless early evening in the middle of August, on the outskirts of Des Moines here at a place called Living History Farms, Joe Biden stood in front of an old yellow barn and talked to a couple hundred people about the past. âI think that, uh, the behavior of this administration has awakened, uh, a whole new generation to get engaged in ways that they may not have gotten before,â Biden said, referring to President Donald Trump and the current tumult. âJust like in my generation, when I got out of school that, uh, when Bobby Kennedy and Dr. King had been assassinated in the â70s, uh, late sevenâwhen I got engaged, um, you know, up to that time, remember the, none of you women will know this, but a couple men may remember, that was a time in the early, late â60s, and the early â60s and â60s, where it was drop out and go to Haight-Ashbury, donât get engaged, donât trust anybody over 30. I mean, for real. What happened to them, by the, by the early â70s, the late â60s, there was a whole generation that said, âEnough.â The war in Vietnam was underway, and it wasâa lot of you served in that warâand, uh, we were fighting like the devil to make sure that there was something dealing with cleaning up the environment, which was only beginning. We were in a position where the womenâs movement was just beginning to move. We should have, by now, long before, passed the ERA amendment, but that was another issue â¦â Sticky-squeezed into plastic chairs, the torpid crowd used handed-out campaign paraphernalia to fan their sweaty faces. But at this mention of the Equal Rights Amendment, somebody started to clap, and others followed suit, and the smattering of applause felt like an act of mercyâgiving the characteristically discursive Biden a chance to reset and everybody else the opportunity to take a breath and maybe not think too hard about the fact that the former vice president had bungled by a decade the dates of two of the most jarring and consequential killings in modern American history. After Biden finished talking, he spent the better part of an hour mingling with the many who wanted to stick around for selfies. Clad in brown loafers, trim tan slacks and a snug navy-blue polo shirt that accentuated the lean musculature of his tan upper arms, he worked the rope line with vigor and veteran aplomb, shaking hands, kissing cheeks and smiling to flash his teeth that are an even brighter shade than his wispy white hair. A young staffer with a clipboard asked a man within my earshot if he wanted to sign up to commit to caucus for Biden. âAlready filled it out,â the man responded. âI think I did that in â87.â The first time Biden ran for presidentâ32 years ago. Many of Biden's supporters are of a generation for which this might be the second or third presidential campaign of his they've supported. This event, like every Biden event, couldnât help but highlight one of the defining realities of his 2020 candidacy: Next month, he turns 77. His age is the subtext, and increasingly the text, too, of not only his bid but the Democratic Partyâs primary as a whole. Even as fading poll numbers loosen his status as the favorite and the mounting impeachment fervor over Ukraine threatens to exact a collateral toll, Bidenâs age remains an overarching issue. Itâs an issue because of the simple math: Only three presidents have served in their 70sâTrump, Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhowerâand no president ever has finished a term at the age Biden would begin his. Itâs an issue because of things Biden has said and doneâsuggesting, for instance, he thought he was in Vermont when he actually was in New Hampshire, dropping that wince-worthy phrase that his âtime is upâ in the first debate and oddly invoking a record player in the last debate. His lifelong habit of flubs, gaffes and often garbled speaking now can seem less like âJoe being Joeâ and more like an ominous indicator of a creeping loss of mental acuity. Itâs an issue because Biden himself has tried in sometimes awkward ways to keep it from being one, inviting a heckler to run with him during a parade and challenging a reporter to a wrestling match. And itâs an issue because opponents, from Trump (âSleepy Joeâ) to those in his own party trying to knock him off, have made it an issueâfrom Eric Swalwell saying it was time to âpass the torchâ to Tim Ryan saying heâs âdecliningâ to Julián Castro (dubiously) accusing him of âforgettingâ things to Cory Booker dishing out ready-made Republican attack ad fodder by bluntly declaring on CNN that âthereâs a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Bidenâs ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumblingâ and âthere are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.â Even the famously gracious Jimmy Carter, who just turned 95, delivered a candid if unhelpful assessment last month when he said he didnât believe he could have handled âthe duties that I experienced when I was presidentâ if he had been 80. This isnât just about Bidenâs ageâitâs about ours, and the tension between a vast cohort of baby boomers who have trained themselves to believe theyâre only as old as they feel and a couple of impatient generations lined up behind them, wondering when theyâre going to get a chance to take over. And yet itâs about far more than simply a number next to a name. Our sense of who is old in this primary has become entwined with our appetite for bold and new ideas. All three of the top-polling Democrats, after all, are in their 70s, but itâs Biden, the centrist who advocates for a return to a pre-Trump time, who is getting dinged the most for his advanced ageânot Elizabeth Warren, who wants âbig, structural changeâ and turned 70 in June. Up until this week when he had to have two heart stents implanted, neither was Bernie Sanders, who continues to call for his ârevolutionâ and is in fact, at 78, the oldest of the lot. Biden greets and charms enthusiastic supporters of all ages across the state of Iowa. But there is an entire cohort of Biden supporters for whom his ageâactual and perceivedâis the very thing that recommends him. After the tumult of the Trump years, these voters crave the experience and order and stability Biden promises. For them, Biden is the beneficiary of shifting social and cultural notions that make it harder to pinpoint what it actually means to be old. Federal law protects workers from age discrimination starting at 40. People can join AARP at 50. Theyâre usually eligible for Medicare at 65 and Social Security at 66. Scientifically, though, a half-dozen aging experts I talked to for this story told me, thereâs such vast variability in how people age that itâs ill-advised and even irresponsible to try to draw conclusions about an individual based on a date of birth. âThere are people at 80 who perform better than 20-year-olds,â said Christopher Van Dyck of Yale University, âeven on these cognitive speed, memory-type tasks.â Furthermore, beyond decades of a healthy diet and sufficient exercise, a significant, intangible, practically mysterious part of the nature of anybodyâs aging, said Tracy Chippendale of New York University, is just â¦ luck. Genes. Joe Bidenâs father died at 86. His mother died at 92. People, said Denise Park of the University of Texas at Dallas, have to make a determination âbased on the behavior that they observe.â Thatâs essentially what Bidenâs repeatedly asked voters to do. âWatch me,â he said in June. âJust watch me.â Over the past six weeks, in three of the most important states in the primary process, I watched himâin South Carolina, in New Hampshire, and here in first-to-caucus Iowa. In Prole, in an oversized lakeside gazebo, I watched him talk about the 1951 Chevy he drove in high school as he sweat through his shirt. âI think we want to have him in the shade, guys,â said an aide to the cluster of reporters who had gathered around him to ask questions. âI donât want him standing in the sun again,â said another. Biden was asked whether he had thought about pledging to just one term to allay the concerns about his age. âNo,â he said. In Newton, blessedly inside at a renovated brick building that used to be a Maytag plant, I watched him tell a crowd about how he âgot elected as a 29-year-old kidâ and how heâs âmet every single major foreign leader that has existed over the last 35 years.â Attendees I talked to, many of whom had white or gray hair themselves, professed to be impressed. âFor a guy thatâs as old as he is,â Tom Spidle, 64, teeing up what came out as a backhanded compliment, told me, âhe looks incredible.â Chuck Walraven, 66, of Oskaloosa agreed. âTo stand up there and talk as much as he did?â he said. âI mean, heâs not gonna fall over dead any more than you are, you know what Iâm saying? I mean, you could die tomorrowâright nowâtalking to me! He could live to be a hundred.â Bruce Hoffmeier is the same age as Biden. He wore hearing aids and leaned on a cane. âHeâs not too old,â Hoffmeier said on his way out. âHe looks good.â And at Living History Farms, I watched Biden keep working that rope line before turning to catch up with the man Iâd overheard tell the young staffer that heâd committed to caucus better than three decades back. Tom Rial of Des Moines was enrolled at the University of Northern Iowa, where he was the president of the student group for Biden. He supported him as well when he ran for the second time in 2007. Heâs supporting him again now. âHeâs just got stature,â Rial, 52, told me. âStature, maturity and experience.â âThe good sides of age,â I offered. âHeâs been around,â Rial granted. We started freaking out about the age of our presidents because of something that happened exactly 100 years ago this week. On October 2, 1919, Woodrow Wilson collapsed in a bathroom at the White House, felled by a stroke that paralyzed his left side and rendered him incapacitated for the last nearly year and a half of his term. He was, the White House head usher would recall, âhelpless.â Wilson, 63 when he was stricken, didnât hold a Cabinet meeting for more than seven months. His aides and his wife banded to do the work of the administration while attempting, too, to obscure the extent of his infirmity. But senators and staff who visited him saw âan emaciated old manâ and âa very old manâ who âacted like one.â It was, in the assessment of one of Wilsonâs biographers, âthe worst crisis of presidential disability in American history.â Top: President Ronald Reagan, then 73, pushes back against questions about his age in a memorable debate moment against his Democratic opponent, Walter Mondale.

Eisenhower, at 65 in October 1955, poses for his first pictures since his coronary thrombosis a month earlier. | Bettman/DEA/Getty Images Wilson was on the mind of Vice President Richard Nixon more than 30 years later, when President Eisenhower had a heart attack in September 1955. Eisenhower recovered, enough to run for and win reelection the following fall, standing in open cars, waving to clamoring crowds, convincing the public that âsuggestions that he was near deathâs door were visibly untrue.â His ailing health in his second term, though, helped stoke the rise of John F. Kennedy, still the youngest president ever elected at 43. But the age-related episode brought up by the historians and operatives I talked to for this story first unspooled over the course of two weeks in October 1984. Reagan, the oldest president ever elected until Trump, in the first of the two general election debates against Democratic nominee Walter Mondale that year appeared alarmingly ill-equipped and scatterbrained. He looked, according to Peter Goldman and Tony Fuller of Newsweek in their book about the campaign, âto be searching his mind and coming up empty.â He looked âdamaged.â He âlooked old,â they wrote. Reagan was 73, and even the typically friendly Wall Street Journal published a front-page article asking whether that was too old, quoting a professor of medicine who said Reagan was shifting from âyoung-oldâ to âold-old.â A pro-Reagan psychologist added, âIâd be concerned to put him into a corporate presidency. Iâd be all the more concerned to put him into the U.S. presidency.â All three networks did stories on it as well, airing an especially discomfiting portion of his performance: âThe system is still where it was in regard to the uh, the uh, the uh, the uh â¦â In the second debate, though, Reagan the ex-actor uncorked what even Mondale would acknowledge as âone of the great lines in the history of presidential debates.â Asked by one of the moderators about his age and his ability âto function,â Reagan responded, âI will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponentâs youth and inexperience.â The audience laughed. Mondale laughed. But he knew he was done. âThe joke,â Mondale wrote in his memoir, âcompletely disarmed peopleâs doubts about his age and his capacities and allowed them to think, âHeâs OK.â They wanted Reagan to be OK and now they could believe it.â âPeople didnât want him to fail,â University of Texas at Austin presidential historian H.W. Brands told me in an email. âHis ability to joke about the issue told them it couldnât be too serious.â âEverybody laughed,â said longtime Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, who led Mondaleâs efforts in Iowa that cycle, âand regardless of what the facts were about whether age was impacting him or not, it was overâthat question was gone.â Age matters. Because health matters. âEventually, something like what happened to Woodrow Wilson is going to happen to us again,â Nixon biographer John Aloysius Farrell said in an interview. âIâve seen almost everythingâan assassination, two impeachmentsâin all my years as a watcher of politics. But Iâve never seen a president die of natural causes in officeâand, you know, weâre due.â But voters donât think like actuaries. Especially not right now. Democrats just want to beat Trump, and polls still say they think Bidenâs the best bet. Also, the challenge for Mondale in the scenario in â84 looks in retrospect like a version of what Bidenâs opponents are dealing with now: He had to try to diminish Reagan while simultaneously showing something along the lines of deference. The late Pat Caddell, the madcap mastermind who that year was an adviser to Mondale, understood how delicate a task it was and how hard it would be. Mondale, he reasoned in a strategy memo, had to âconvince voters that Reagan has âlost itâ and that he ought to be retired. â¦ In short, we want to have the American electorate emulate the British electorate in 1945 when they turned on Winston Churchill.â Still, the hit had to be deft. He all but likened it to putting a family elder in a nursing homeââsort of embracing a grandfather,â Caddell wrote, âand gently pushing him aside.â Mondale couldnât do it, and none of the younger 2020 candidates have managed it yet with Biden, either. Last month in New Hampshire, in Laconia, on the top floor of âthe oldest unaltered brick textile mill in the U.S.,â according to the adjacent historical marker, I watched Biden tell people the salary for a senator back when he was first elected was $42,000 a year, briefly mix up Reagan with Nixon, and refer to Charlottesville as Charlotte before correcting himself 2½ minutes later. âI found the vice president inspiring,â David Huot told me outside. Almost eight months older than Biden, heâs still a state representative. âWhy the hell should I say heâs old?â Huot said. âIâm old.â Biden works the rope lines. More often than not, though, I didnât even have to ask about age. After Huot, for instance, I met Dr. Paul Sapir, 91, and his wife, Sylvia, 76, Rhode Island residents with a nearby summer home, and asked them open-endedly what they thought of Bidenâs performance. âI was very impressed,â she said. âYou know, Iâve been very worried about him in terms of his gaffes, but he seemed to know facts and figures, and they seemed to come to him easily.â Her husband, a retired psychiatrist, joined in. âIt was quite reassuring about him and his intactness and his coherence,â he said. âHe seems pretty intact.â Intact. Sapir sounded like an archeologist describing a papyrus scroll. That evening, in nippy New Castle over on the Atlantic coast, a man stood at the rear of the crowd in an oceanfront park and poked fun with a held-high sign welcoming Biden back to Vermont. In the question-and-answer session after his talk, Biden called a 24-year-old woman who asked about climate change âkiddo.â She said she found it âpatronizing.â The next morning, at the state Democratic Party convention at the sports arena in downtown Manchester, New Hampshire, Biden was the first of all the presidential candidates to take the stage. The crowd was still sparse. He stifled coughs. By far the most memorable part of his speech was when he called Donald Trump âDonald Hump.â People snickered. Biden ad-libbed. âFreudian slip,â he said. The malaprop made for a droplet of entertainment. But the more meaningful development of the day, it seemed, happened not out in the open hall but rather in the bowels of the venue, in a stuffy, fluorescent-lit room, in which the roster of Oval Office aspirants could come talk to the assembled throng of reporters. Biden opted not to show up. Virtually everybody else did, though, and what unfolded in his absence was a collective crescendo of talk about the age issueâa preview of sorts of what would come the following week during and after the Houston debate. Tim Ryan, 46, pointed to âa lack of clarityâ in the way Biden speaks. Pete Buttigieg, 37, said Democrats traditionally win the presidency with new, fresh faces, not âestablished and Washington-tenured figures.â Booker, 50, managed to turn a question about climate change into a chance to call attention to his relative youth. âIâve seen military reports about whatâs going to happen in the next 25 yearsâwhen, as another one of my colleagues says, I will still be younger than the president of the United States.â And Castro, days before he would unleash toward Biden his âforgettingâ fusillade, was explicit. âI believe that we need a new generation of leadership,â he said, citing party presidential antecedents Kennedy, Carter, Clinton and Obama. âI believe people are looking for that again.â Biden addresses the congregation at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, on the 56th anniversary of a bombing by members of the KKK that killed four young girls who were members of the church. Biden, however, remains the candidate to beatâin spite of the softening of his standing in some polls. Older political hands think they know why. âItâs perfectly all right to call for a new generation of leadership,â longtime Democratic strategist Bob Shrum told me. But he warned of âthe danger of trying to go after Biden.â âThere is,â former top Obama strategist David Axelrod emailed, âa lot of affection and respect among Democrats for Biden. He is popular. Gratuitous attacks on him are not well received. And in an environment in which defeating Trump is the urgent concern of many Democrats, Biden seems like the safest, least risky choice.â Itâs why Joe Trippi looks at the 2020 primary to this point and finds himself thinking back to the 2010 California gubernatorial campaign. Jerry Brown was pitted against Meg Whitman. Trippi worked for Brown. Whitman was 54 and was coming off a decade of having been the CEO of eBay. Brown, on the other hand, had been around for just about forever, and had done just about everythingâgovernor already before, mayor of Oakland, attorney general, three times a presidential candidate. He was 72. But the political terrain in the state coming out of eight years with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and in the wake of the Great Recession was jangled. Trippi was âblown awayâ by what he learned from voters in focus groups. âWe would give them this really stellar bio of Meg Whitman, and they all went, âNo way.â And youâre like, âWhat?â And it was like, âNo wayâwe tried somebody from outside government who didnât know what the hell they were doing. â¦ It was just too chaotic. We donât want anybody new. We donât want anybody from outside. Just somebody who knows how to turn the lights on in Sacramento. â¦ Canât you just give me an old shoe? I just want an old shoe.ââ In the case of that race, Trippi explained, they won by looking not forward so much as back. Maybe thatâs whatâs at work right now. âWith age comes experience,â he said, âand with a chaotic president, the experience may count more than the age.â It may. But thatâs the exception to the rule. Usually itâs the other way around. In 1972, for example, Cale Boggs was a two-term U.S. senator from Delaware. He was 63. Reporters in their coverage of the campaign described his âthinning hairâ and said he sometimes got âtongue-tied.â Biden in 1972, the year he was first elected to the Senate from Delaware. Right: Biden, right, carries his two son and stands next to his wife, Neilia, who was tragically killed in a car crash later that same year. | Henry Griffin/AP Photo His challenger, meanwhile, a one-term county councilman, was 29. Reporters called Joe Biden âboyishly slimâ and noted that he often talked about âhow the old guard has bungled things.â Biden ran newspaper ads yoking the incumbent to imagery evocative of bygone days. âCale Boggsâ generation dreamed of conquering polio,â one said. âIn 1950 Cale Boggs hoped to make Americans safe from Stalin,â a second said. Another mentioned âthe 1948 poll tax.â The ads emphasized the need for ânew thinkingâ and ânew solutions.â Boggs was âa helluva nice guyâ but âwas just not a fighter,â Biden said. He wondered if he had âlost that twinkle in his eyes.â The steely sketching of this contrast was âpretty much the essenceâ of the Biden campaignâs strategy, according to one of his best friends and most important advisers. âHis basic theory was Senator Boggs was beloved, but these were changing times,â he said. The pitch pretty much boiled down to this: âIf Senator Boggs and I could just go down to the football stadium at the University of Delaware and people saw the two of us, theyâd pick me.â They did. Now, though, at the opposite end of the cycle of his political life, Bidenâs presidential candidacy is unavoidably an implicit argument against the very sort of youthful energy and not-gonna-wait rebellion that put him in a position of power in the first place. I was thinking about Delaware and 1972 a few weeks ago as I pulled in to park in a pecan orchard on the banks of the Little Pee Dee River in rural South Carolina. The first thing I saw on the door of a car was a big placard of a magnet bearing a rendering of the face of Pete Buttigieg. âWe canât look for greatness,â it said, âin the past.â Up the road a short way, outside the Galivants Ferry general store, vendors in trucks and tents hawked sweet tea, pimento cheese sliders and six-buck chicken bog. A bluegrass band was picking on the porch not far from the lectern made to look like a stump. Sticking out in the growing crowd was a ruddy man wearing flip-flops and a âMAKE AMERICA GROOVE AGAINâ hat and carrying a sign saying he was a âREPUBLICAN FOR PETE.â Biden stands on stage with his supporters standing behind him, and he greets other supporters after giving a speech. âMayor Peteâs a selfless servant,â John Dabrowski told me. Heâs 37, lives on Pawleys Island and works in sales at a brewery in Myrtle Beach. Heâs not happy with Trump, whom he called âa bully.â After his wife, Peta, got turned on to Buttigieg by drinking wine and watching YouTube videos, Dabrowski, too, identified the alternative he was looking for. He thinks Buttigieg is the person who can beat the president. âWe canât put somebody thatâs gonna ostracize Republicans that are moderates like me, fiscal conservatives but also super liberal in other, you know, social aspects.â But what about Biden? âNo,â he said. âHeâs old guard. I believe in term limits, and Joeâs not gonna do it for me. I mean, we donât need somebody thatâs been doing it for all these years. I want somebody thatâs gonna be around for the policies that theyâre gonna write, OK? Mayor Pete, if we put in some type of green policy or some type of coal policy, heâs going to see the repercussions because heâs going to be around for it. Bidenâs not gonna be around for 30 years to see the effects of his policiesâand that matters to me. Doesnât that carry more weight? I want somebody to be living with their policy.â Dabrowskiâs friend chimed in. Buttigieg âwill be president,â said Ree Lawson, 54, a high school debate and public speaking teacher in Waccamaw. âIt might not be this time.â But next time? Or the time after that? And after that? âWe could go through four more cycles. He could run and still be a young man.â On the docket for the evening at the Galivants Ferry Stumpâwhere Democrats running for office have spoken since shortly after the Civil Warâwere four presidential candidates. First was Amy Klobuchar, and last was Bill de Blasio, who was a few days from dropping outâbut in between was one heck of a Biden v. Boggs-like contrast. Biden jogs on to the stage at a campaign event in Iowa. Buttigieg, who was 5 years old when Biden first ran for president, bounded to his spot behind the stump, dressed in his uniform of dark slacks and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up. âThis is a time to unify the American people. This is a time for ideas that are bold enough to get the job done and capable of bringing us together. And if you think about it, thatâs how Democrats win, from John F. Kennedy to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton to Barack Obama. We win when we offer leadership from a new generation, with new ideas,â he said. âAre you ready to break from the past?â The cheer that went up from the people suggested that they were. Then, though, led to the stump by a stomping, gyrating, instrument-waggling troupe from Florence, the energetic marching band from that cityâs Wilson High, Biden was ready to respond. He spoke for his allotted 20 minutes, a faster, localized version of his standard spiel, citing another senator he once worked with (the recently deceased Fritz Hollings of South Carolina), stressing âhonesty,â âdignityâ and âdecency,â and extolling Obama not as one of the series of fresh-faced Democrats who won the White House but as the president he served. âFolks,â he said, âIâm just gonna say it. I donât think we thank Barack Obama enough for the job he did as president!â The audience roared. Biden built to a crescendo of his own. Grabbing hold of a past that never fails to invigorate him, he clenched his fist. He raised his voice. âWhy in Godâs name donât we pick our heads up and remember whoâthis is the United States of America!â California By Jeremy B.

Donald Trump has called for changing laws that govern interrogation techniques to “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.” | AP By BEN SCHRECKINGER 03/30/2016 04:12 PM EDT Updated 03/30/2016 04:59 PM EDT APPLETON, Wis. — Donald Trump believes American troops are afraid to fight for fear of violating the Geneva Conventions, he said Wednesday. “The problem is we have the Geneva Conventions, all sorts of rules and regulations, so the soldiers are afraid to fight,” Trump said at an afternoon town hall during remarks on torture. “We can’t waterboard, but they can chop off heads,” Trump said, referring to the United States and the Islamic State, respectively. “I think we’ve got to make some changes, some adjustments.” The Geneva Conventions, adopted broadly after World War II, govern the treatment of civilians and prisoners of war — including a ban on torture and summary executions. They mirror rules the U.S. adopted in 1882. Trump has called for changing laws that govern interrogation techniques to “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.” Trump has also previously said that American troops would not disobey him if he gave them illegal orders, but he later walked that remark back. A campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday’s remarks. Ben Schreckinger is a reporter for . © 2021  LLC",

        "articles": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addresses the media following a closed Senate Intel briefing. He said, \"There is no direct reporting connecting the crown prince to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\" | M. Scott Mahaskey/ Foreign Policy Senators are demanding to hear from CIA Director Gina Haspel, who was conspicuously absent from Wednesday’s briefing. By NAHAL TOOSI and CAITLIN OPRYSKO 11/28/2018 01:10 PM EST Updated 11/28/2018 05:15 PM EST Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday vigorously backed President Donald Trump’s defense of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, but failed to appease senators who are demanding to hear directly from the CIA director about who directed the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is under intense global scrutiny amid suspicion that he ordered Khashoggi's murder. But Trump, citing the importance of Saudi cooperation against Iran and multi-billion-dollar arms deals, has dismissed the allegations against bin Salman, including reported assessments from the CIA. The tension risks spilling over later this week at the G-20 in Argentina, where the White House said Trump and the crown prince may informally meet, a diplomatically sensitive situation given the outrage over Khashoggi. And that same outrage is already engulfing much of Congress, with lawmakers from both parties demanding accountability — and an in-person briefing from CIA Director Gina Haspel. While Pompeo and Mattis both met with senators in a classified session on Wednesday — and later told reporters that there is no \"direct reporting\" linking the crown prince to Khashoggi’s death — Haspel was conspicuously absent, despite having traveled to the region to investigate Khashoggi’s killing. She is also one of the few top Trump aides who has listened to an audio recording of the murder.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters that Pompeo and Mattis said the White House had directed Haspel to not show up. But the CIA categorically dismissed that explanation. “While Director Haspel did not attend today’s Yemen policy briefing, the agency has already briefed the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and Congressional leadership on the totality of the compartmented, classified intelligence and will continue to provide updates on this important matter to policymakers and Congress,” CIA spokesman Timothy Barrett said. “The notion that anyone told Director Haspel not to attend today's briefing is false.” The White House deferred to the CIA for comment on the matter. Regardless, senators expressed intense frustration over her absence. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump, slammed the White House over Haspel’s absence, calling the briefing \"inadequate\" and threatening to withhold his vote on any must-pass legislation until such a briefing is held. \"I am not going to be denied the ability to be briefed by the CIA that we have oversight of about whether or not their assessment supports my belief that this could not have happened without MBS knowing,\" the South Carolina Republican said. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who has called for the Trump administration to take a harsher line on Saudi Arabia in response to the Khashoggi killing, told reporters following the briefing that \"I wish [Haspel] would have been there,” adding that “a lot of us were frustrated that she wasn't.\" Pompeo was also asked Wednesday why Haspel did not attend, given that Pompeo attended similar briefings in his previous role as CIA director. “I was asked to be here, and here I am,” Pompeo replied. Elections By REBECCA MORIN Instead, Pompeo and Mattis both effectively took the side of the president – and the crown prince -- by telling reporters that there’s no definitive proof that the Saudi royal, commonly known as MBS, was linked to the death of Khashoggi. “I do believe I’ve read every piece of intelligence — unless it’s come in the last few hours, I think I've read it all,” Pompeo said. “There is no direct reporting connecting the crown prince to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. And that’s all I can say in an unclassified setting.” Mattis told journalists that the administration still has “no smoking gun that the crown prince was involved — not the intelligence community or anyone else.” Mattis and Pompeo’s comments appeared at odds with media reports that the CIA had concluded with “high confidence” that Khashoggi’s murder was carried out at the direction of MBS. The remarks also seemed to set an unusually high bar for U.S. officials when it comes to establishing fault for crimes committed by leaders overseas. U.S. lawmakers are well aware that Saudi Arabia is an important contributor to oil markets and a key security partner for the U.S., but some are deeply troubled by the seeming recklessness of the crown prince. Bin Salman is still in his 30s and has only in recent years become a powerful figure in the Saudi kingdom; he could rule the kingdom for decades after his father, King Salman, dies. MBS is already accused of serious human rights violations well beyond what happened to Khashoggi, including ordering the abduction, imprisonment and torture of dissidents. MBS also is in charge of the Saudi military effort in Yemen, where fighting has left millions facing famine. But Pompeo and Mattis have been urging lawmakers not to vote in favor of a resolution to cut off U.S. support for the Saudi-led forces in Yemen. Media By BEN SCHRECKINGER That effort was unsuccessful in the Senate, which voted 63-37 to advance the bipartisan bid to yank that U.S. support. In an op-ed that ran Tuesday, Pompeo had argued that helping the Saudis in Yemen was key to preventing Iran from spreading its influence throughout the Middle East. In the op-ed, Pompeo accused lawmakers of \"caterwauling\" about Saudi Arabia's human rights record. The war powers resolution was tabled in the chamber earlier this year, but is picking up supporters who are eager to push back on Saudi Arabia in response to a weak White House response to the Khashoggi killing. Pompeo told reporters that the administration felt the resolution would be “poorly timed” as he felt diplomats were “on the cusp” of being able to begin negotiations for a ceasefire. Some critics argue, however, that withdrawing U.S. support from the Saudis could increase pressure on the parties involved to agree to a cease-fire. Hanging over Wednesday’s development was the possibility that Trump may wind up running into the Saudi crown prince on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting later this week in Argentina. The White House on Tuesday would not rule out the possibility of a Trump-MBS interaction. If Trump takes a gregarious and friendly tone toward MBS, that will likely go down well in the Saudi kingdom, where media is tightly controlled and Khashoggi has been cast more as an Islamist sympathizer than a dissident journalist. At the same time, it could add momentum to attempts in Congress to legislate new sanctions on the Saudis. Elana Schor and Marianne Levine contributed to this report. Missing out on the latest scoops?

A senior Democratic aide said Rep. André Carson of Indiana would be named in the “coming days” to the key national security-focused panel. Pelosi (D-Calif.) told lawmakers of the appointment during the members’ weekly caucus meeting. Carson would be the first Muslim to serve on the committee and was the second Muslim to be elected to Congress. He already serves on the Armed Services Committee and worked for the Department of Homeland Security’s Fusion Center — the clearinghouse established by the federal government to streamline data sharing between the CIA, FBI, Department of Justice and the military. The intelligence committee will most likely tackle a series of high-profile international crises during the 114th Congress, including the threat of Islamic militants and Ukraine. Carson’s office didn’t immediately return a request for comment. The announcement comes in the wake of last week’s terrorist attack by Islamic extremists and subsequent shootouts with police that left 17 people dead. World leaders gathered on Sunday for a 1 million person “solidarity” protest against the violence that targeted French Jews and journalists. Follow @ Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "The path to a Democratic majority remains narrow. By ALEXANDER BURNS 01/03/2013 04:31 AM EST Democrats, facing a challenging fight to retake the House of Representatives in 2014, see a promising new line of attack rising out of the fiscal cliff follies: casting the Republican congressional majority as a terminally dysfunctional body that cannot perform the basic functions of government, let alone lead the country through difficult times. It’s a meaningful shift from the Democrats’ message in 2012, when President Barack Obama’s party gained a modest eight seats in the House attacking Republicans as ultraconservative allies of the super-rich. ( Also on : Conservatives look to next battle) After the past two weeks of tumultuous negotiations over the fiscal cliff, which ended late on New Year’s Day with a majority of House Democrats and minority of Republicans voting to raise taxes on upper-income Americans, Democratic strategists now say that competence, as much as ideology, will be at the core of their midterm message. In other words: if Democrats wanted last cycle to be about whether Mitt Romney and other Republicans were too right wing and elitist to govern, they hope to make next cycle about whether the GOP House can operate on any ideological terms at all. ( PHOTOS: Who won, lost with fiscal cliff) New York Rep. Steve Israel, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the political reality is that “people do tend to blame Republicans for this chaos” and the minority party has two years to explain to voters how the fallout from that hurts their lives. “If we continue to be the problem solvers and Republicans continue to be the problem, we will have a very strong path to getting the majority,” Israel said. “Republicans are drawing those contrasts with every cliff they try to throw us off.” The House’s image took another hit Wednesday when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a potential Republican presidential candidate, lashed out at congressional Republicans for failing to schedule a vote on aid for Americans affected by Hurricane Sandy. ( Also on : GOP anti-tax policy goes over the cliff) “Americans are tired of the palace intrigue and political partisanship of this Congress, which places one-upsmanship ahead of the lives of the citizens who sent these people to Washington, D.C., in the first place,” Christie said. “New York deserves better than the selfishness we saw on display last night. New Jersey deserves better than the duplicity we saw on display last night. America deserves better than just another example of a government that has forgotten who they are there to serve and why.” The path to a Democratic majority remains narrow, party leaders acknowledge, thanks to the post-2010 redistricting that shored up the GOP’s hold on once-competitive districts across the nation. If Republicans were to lose control of the chamber in 2014, it would likely be thanks to grievous missteps on the part of their own leaders and candidates, in addition to any successful Democratic campaign. Few operatives in either party believe Republicans have wounded themselves to that degree so far: The 113th Congress is only being sworn in Thursday and the next election is nearly two years away. Yet with months of sparring ahead over the debt ceiling, the deep and unpopular spending cuts in sequestration and the grim overall fiscal state of the nation, there’s ample peril ahead for GOP lawmakers who threw the House into chaos throughout the month of December. In particular, the inability of House Republicans to rally behind Speaker John Boehner’s proposed Plan B fiscal cliff deal — a tax on millionaires coupled with spending cuts, which never even made it to the House floor — raised questions for both parties about whether the House is even a functional body. And even before the cliff fiasco, Republicans were shackled with a dreadful national image: only 30 percent of respondents in a December NBC/Wall Street Journal poll had a positive impression of the party, versus 45 percent who had a negative impression. (For Democrats, those numbers were 44 percent positive, 35 percent negative.) Obama and other Democrats argued in 2012 that the intransigent Congress was in part to blame for the sluggish economy; voters seemed open to the argument. Alixandria Lapp, who heads the Democratic group House Majority PAC, said that when “House Republicans are tagged as the people unwilling to compromise on behalf of the American people, that’s helpful for Democrats.” “They’re really isolating themselves,” Lapp said. “If this is a pattern that continues, which is headline after headline saying ‘House Republican leaders fail on X,’ and ‘House Republicans refuse to compromise on Y,’ then I think that becomes a real big problem for them.” Republicans steering House campaign strategy dismissed the outbreak of Democratic confidence as the latest in a series of boom-and-bust mood swings on the part of the congressional minority. Far from fearing the consequences of legislative wrangling, Republicans contend that the 2014 cycle will most likely be defined by questions about spending, on which the GOP has long held an advantage. So if Republicans struggled to win a confrontation over taxes with Obama this week, the longer-range issue set for 2014 may be less daunting. “House Democrats are as addicted to phony optimism as they are to spending. They have been proclaiming that they are on the cusp of retaking the House from the moment they lost it,” said Republican strategist Brad Todd, who advises the National Republican Congressional Committee. “If Democrats want to make the 2014 election a referendum on whether we should have a fiscal chaperone for the president and whether he should borrow and spend too much money, we’re happy to have that referendum.” With a limited battlefield of competitive races and lower turnout than the 2012 presidential year, Todd argued Republicans “have an excellent opportunity to grow our majority in the midterms.” GOP strategists privately acknowledge it would be a problem if the party somehow allowed itself to become synonymous with Washington dysfunction. But that would require mismanaging future fiscal confrontations — starting with the upcoming debt ceiling fight — at least as dramatically as they flubbed the cliff deal. Republican pollster Brock McCleary, a former top NRCC official, said that in the short term, most lawmakers “cast a vote they can tout back home” on the fiscal cliff. “In safe seats, conservatives protected their right flank. In competitive districts, polling shows that striking a compromise and making the rich pay a little more plays quite well,” McCleary said. “House Republicans were just reelected with the second-largest majority since World War II. They did so in spite of a Democratic president being reelected and a Medicare issue that Democrats predicted would be their shortcut back to the majority.” On its own, the fiscal cliff vote isn’t a “TARP-level vote,” said one Republican official, referring to the high-stakes fight over the 2008 bank bailouts. “Is this Obamacare? The stimulus? No,” the Republican said. “I think more members would be concerned about the primaries right now as opposed to how this will affect the general election.” That fact, Democrats say, is one of the prime reasons Republicans may continue to create self-inflicted wounds: With so many members in solid-red districts, there’s little electoral pressure for the party to compromise rather than to escalate dramatically on spending issues they consider their political home turf. “Many of their seats are so Republican that maybe they’re not so concerned about the general elections. But I think we’ve learned in wave elections, it doesn’t really matter how conservative or liberal your seat is. For Democrats, that is maybe what they need — not a wave like 2008 or 2010, but something that maintains the momentum Democrats have generated since the election,” said Democratic strategist Doug Thornell, a former senior Hill aide. “There are opportunities that exist today that didn’t even on Election Day, when we had a pretty good day,” Thornell said. “[Republicans] are going to have to demonstrate over the next four or five months that they are fit to lead again.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

Approximately 37 percent went for the former secretary of state, while 35 percent threw their support behind Sanders. Vice President Joe Biden, who has not announced a run, received just 11 percent. Additionally, just 36 percent want Biden to get into the race, while about 50 percent say the vice president should not seek a third run for the White House (he previously ran in the 1988 and 2008 cycles). It's a marked swing in the right direction for Clinton, who drew just 28 percent to Sanders' 42 percent in a September NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll in the state. In that poll, too, Biden fared better, at 18 percent. Suffolk had not polled Democratic voters in New Hampshire since June, when Clinton led by 10 points, 41 percent to 31 percent. The poll was conducted Oct. 14-15, surveying 500 likely Democratic primary voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. Missing out on the latest scoops?

Democrats in Congress are set to introduce legislation to expand the size of the Supreme Court from nine justices to 13. | Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images By MARIANNE LEVINE 04/14/2021 09:01 PM EDT Link Copied House and Senate Democrats will introduce legislation Thursday to expand the number of Supreme Court justices to 13 from nine, drawing more attention to the debate surrounding court reform. The bill, led by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), is the first legislation in recent years designed to add seats to the high court, and its introduction comes as progressive organizations are pushing for court expansion, after watching Senate Republicans fill three Supreme Court vacancies in four years under President Donald Trump. Brian Fallon, executive director of the liberal group Demand Justice, said the bill represents a “new era where Democrats finally stop conceding the Supreme Court to Republicans.\" He added that the task for progressives now “is to build a grassroots movement that puts pressure on every Democrat in Congress to support this legislation because it is the only way to restore balance to the Court and protect our democracy.” President Joe Biden, however, has said he is “not a fan” of the idea, also known as “court packing.” Instead, the White House announced last week the creation of a bipartisan commission to study reforms to the Supreme Court and produce a report. The high court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority. While advocates have been pushing for the addition of seats to the Supreme Court, the bill won’t see much movement in the evenly split Senate, with all Republicans and several moderate Democrats opposed to court expansion. The legislation is all but guaranteed to prompt attacks from Republicans, who during the 2020 elections warned that Democrats would expand the courts if they took control of Washington. Justice Stephen Breyer, who outside groups are urging to retire before the 2022 midterms, recently cautioned against court packing for fear that doing so would only undermine public confidence in the institution. The issue, nevertheless, served as a litmus test during the 2020 Democratic primary for progressives. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), then-Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and Pete Buttigieg suggested they were open to the idea. But others, including Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), did not back it. The number of seats on the high court has fluctuated in American history, from as few as five to as many as 10. Link Copied © 2021  LLC",

        "articles": "Getty Law And Order The FBI director says he doesnât \"give a hootâ about politics. But when it comes to Clinton and her emails, heâs made a series of political decisions that have jeopardized the integrity of the FBIâand the U.S. election process. By RILEY ROBERTS October 30, 2016 Riley Roberts was a speechwriter for former Attorney General Eric Holder. FBI Director James Comeyâs disdain for partisan politics is well known among his Justice Department colleagues. A respected former prosecutor who has held high-profile jobs in both Democratic and Republican administrations, this clean-cut father of five sees himself as a straight shooter who, in his own words, doesnât \"give a hootâ about politics. But the past four months have completely exploded that notion. Since July, by repeatedly caving to political pressures as he sought to resolve an investigation that has now been grievously compromised by his own public statements, the director has led the bureau into its most politically perilous chapter in generationsâwith the presidential campaign hanging in the balance. Itâs a crisis thatâs unprecedented in FBI historyâand the endgame, with just over a week until Election Day, is anything but clear. The latest in the FBI directorâs series of political bungles came over the course of the day on October 28âthe second-to-last Friday before Election Dayâwhen Comey approved, signed and sent two letters that will go down as infamous in the history of presidential politics and the annals of law enforcement. In the first, addressed to the Republican chairmen of eight congressional committees, Comey dropped a bombshell that shook the presidential race. In defiance of longstanding tradition, Justice Department policy and an explicit warning from the departmentâs senior leadership, the director informed Congress that the FBI would be taking âappropriate investigative stepsâ to review âemails that appear to be pertinentâ to its probe into Hillary Clintonâs email practicesâa probe that Comey himself had very publicly laid to rest more than three months earlier. With the second letter, addressed âTo allâ and distributed to FBI employees, the director made a feeble attempt at damage control. Acknowledging that the FBI doesnât âordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations,â that it did not yet âknow the significance of this newly discovered collection of emailsâ and that his first letter carried âa significant risk of being misunderstood,â Comey defended his decision to subordinate the Justice Departmentâs clear-cut rules to his own personal judgment. âI â¦ think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record,â he wrote, apparently oblivious to the fact that his ill-conceived âsupplementâ was already spawning dozens of misleading headlines, even plunging financial markets (briefly) into turmoil. Together, these letters give the lie to Comeyâs repeated insistence that the FBI is above politics, exposing that notion as both irrelevantâbecause, whatever his motivations, Comeyâs actions have placed the FBI at center stage during the presidential campaignâs climactic momentâand absurd, because the director has, in fact, repeatedly bowed to political pressures arising from the Clinton investigation. In early July, when the investigation reached its (initial) conclusion, Comey called an extraordinary news conference to opine, before the national media, on the Democratic nomineeâs âextremely carelessâ conductâeven as he insisted that âno reasonable prosecutorâ would file charges against her. The fact that no prosecutor had been consulted was, for Comey, a point of prideâevidence, he thought, of his independence, rather than his brazen disregard for Justice Department rules (which dictated that a senior DOJ official, not the FBI director, should have had the final say). Especially in retrospect, it is difficult to interpret Comeyâs rambling statementâwhich veered at times into speculation and would have been assailed as prejudicial, had the FBI proposed charges against Clintonâas anything other than a preemptive defense against Republican allegations of partisanship. It was, in its own way, a purely political exerciseâand an unfortunate mistake that Comey would compound, just two days later, by acquiescing to demands that he account for his conclusions in an open congressional hearing. This unusual step, in turn, not only made the FBI complicit in a political assault on a presidential candidate; it invited members of Congress to pick through reams of investigative materials that the bureau normally holds in strict confidence. Even worse, Comeyâs decision to release these materials to the public at the same time deprived Clinton of the chance to defend her actions and challenge the governmentâs findings in a court of law. By making the materials publicly available, Comey empowered political actors to second-guess investigators while arming Republicans with the evidence they needed to take their case to the court of public opinion. At every stage, Comeyâs defenders have argued that the very existence of the Clinton investigation has put the FBI director in an impossible position. Had he handled it like any ordinary matter, they sayâignoring political pressures, releasing a terse statement that the investigation would be closed without charges, or perhaps declining to say anything at allâthe FBI would surely have faced intense criticism. Such an outcome might have eroded the publicâs faith in the competence and impartiality of federal law enforcementâa worrisome prospect, to be sure. The trouble with this line of reasoningâthat the rules do not apply in cases like Clintonâs, and that the need for âextraordinary transparency,â as defined by the FBI director, outweighs the rights of a person under investigationâis that every successive disclosure sets an unfortunate precedent (or at least a public expectation), and every new exemption leads to another. If Comey was willing to explicate his thinking at a televised news conference, why not do soâin even greater detailâbefore a congressional committee? If the director was happy to discuss evidence that the Justice Department had declined to present in court, why not release that evidence to the general public? And if Congress is entitled to join in the FBIâs investigative deliberationsâevaluating its evidence and critiquing its every moveâwhy not provide updates in real time? On Friday, with his vaguely worded letter to Congressâa letter that again broke with precedent, that was ripe for misinterpretation and that he had been advised by his superiors not to sendâComey took this logic to its regrettable conclusion. The result, as we have seen, has been less clarity, not more; rising, rather than falling, confusion and controversy; and an enormously heightened, rather than minimized, impact on the presidential election. This is something that past FBI directors have taken great pains to avoidâand for good reason: Even the appearance of influencing an election, with or without an overtly partisan agenda, would spell disaster for the FBIâs credibility. Had Comeyâthe straight shooterâsimply allowed his actions to be guided by rules that had been exquisitely crafted, over decades, to prevent this from occurring, he would have faced criticism for quietly closing the Clinton case and refusing to improperly air its findings. And it would have been his job, as a law enforcement professional, to absorb this criticism. By instead carving exceptions to those rules whenever it suited his judgment, he has done far greater (and potentially lasting) damage to the FBIâs reputationâleading his agency to the very outcome he once hoped, at all costs, to avoid. However pure Comeyâs motives, his actions have been irresponsibleââcareless,â he might sayâin the extreme. It is startling to consider that, in an election roiled by what looks to be unsettling Russian interference, violent rhetoric and a chilling pledge by one candidate to jail his political opponent, one of the most palpable shocks to the 2016 campaignâat least to this pointâmight well have been touched off by the FBI director. The situation must be personally agonizing for Comey, whose distaste for partisan politics is well known among current and former Justice Department officials (many of whom greeted last weekâs letters with cold fury). But the director has no one but himself to blame. In the coming days, if past is prologue, Comey will devise a way to respond to this spiraling political furor, further bending the rules toward âextraordinary transparencyâ in hopes of clarifying at least some of the ambiguities introduced in his letters. Unfortunately, though, the damage has likely been done. The headline itself has become the indictment; the underlying facts matter hardly at all. With just over a week until Election Dayâand early voting underway in more than two dozen statesâthere is precious little time to set the record straight. California By Jeremy B.

        "articles": "By NICK GASS 06/15/2015 08:11 AM EDT In a trio of new polls in early primary states, Hillary Clinton leads Democratic rivals in Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire. It’s in the Granite State, however, that the former secretary of state’s standing is the least rock-solid, according to new polls conducted by Morning Consult. Among Democratic voters who say they will participate in the state’s primary next year, 44 percent back Clinton. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from neighboring Vermont, grabs 32 percent. Vice President Joe Biden, who has shown little inclination to run, claims 8 percent of likely Democratic voters. Also on  NICK GASS In Iowa, Clinton picked up 54 percent, with no other candidate over 20 percent. Sanders finished next, at 12 percent. In South Carolina, 56 percent of likely primary voters expressed support for Clinton. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee polled low in all three early states. The survey polled 905 registered voters in Iowa, including 313 likely Democratic caucus-goers; 906 registered voters in South Carolina, including 309 likely Democratic primary voters; and 816 registered voters in New Hampshire, including 279 likely Democratic voters. The overall margin of error for each state is plus or minus 3 percentage points, while the margin of error for Democratic respondents in all three states is plus or minus 6 percentage points.

        "articles": "Evan Vucci/AP Photo 1600 Penn In their eyes, religious conservatives arenât making a cynical bargain by embracing a president with dubious religious bona fides. They finally have the street brawler theyâve always wanted. By TIM ALBERTA October 14, 2017 Tim Alberta is national political reporter at  Magazine. WASHINGTON, D.C.âDonald Trumpâs supporters always had diverging interpretations of his campaign mantra, âMake America Great Again,â yet they all centered on returning the country to a better and more comfortable time. To economic nationalists, it meant going back to an era of high tariffs and buying American. To defense hawks, it meant returning to a time of unquestioned military supremacy. To immigration hard-liners, it meant fewer jobs for foreign-born workersâand, for some of those voters, fewer dark faces in the country, period. But for many evangelicals and conservative Catholics, âMake America Great Againâ meant above all else returning to a time when the culture reflected and revolved around their Judeo-Christian values. When there was prayer in public schools. When marriage was limited to one man and one woman. When abortion was not prevalent and socially acceptable. When the government didnât ask them to violate their consciences. And, yes, when people said âMerry Christmasâ instead of âHappy Holidays.â This explains one of the more striking lines in Trumpâs speech Friday to the Values Voter Summit, which in just 10 years has become one of the premier annual gatherings of social conservatives in Washington. Touting the âcustoms, beliefs and traditions that defined who we are as a nation and as a people,â the president recalled the Foundersâ repeated reference to a âCreatorâ in the Declaration of Independence. âHow times have changed,â Trump said. âBut you know what? Now theyâre changing back again. Just remember that.â The audience roared with a 20-second standing ovation. Of course, much of the cultural drift the âvalues votersâ fear seems irreversible as Americaâs demographic transformation yields an electorate that is younger, more ethnically diverse, more urban, more educated and less religious. Same-sex marriage is settled law with ever-broadening public support; abortion rights are probably impossible to fully retract. And the countryâs steady secularization, decried for decades from church pulpits, appears to have accelerated in recent years: According to a comprehensive Pew Research Center poll of more than 35,000 Americans, the share of self-identified Christians decreased nearly 7 percent between 2007 and 2014, while the share of religiously unaffiliated citizens increased nearly 7 percent in that time. What, then, can a thrice-married Manhattan billionaireâor any politician, for that matterârealistically offer Christian voters who hope for a cultural and spiritual revival in America? Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, the conservative group that organizes the Values Voter Summit, says Trumpâs greatest impact is legitimizing those people and views that have been marginalized. âBarack Obama used the bully pulpit and the courts to demonize those who held to the very values that made America great. And Trump is doing the opposite,â Perkins says. âWhat the president and his administration can do is once again make people feel like itâs OK to stand up and talk about these traditional values, and engage in these conversations. Then we can win hearts and minds, and thatâs where the transformation begins.â Others, however, are taking a more direct approach. The biggest draw of the weekend event, other than the president himself, was Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate and former chief justice of the stateâs Supreme Court. Moore was removed from office twice: once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from courthouse grounds, and 14 years later, having reclaimed the position, for directing state judges to ignore the federal governmentâs legalization of same-sex marriages. To Moore and his admirers, these incidents were evidence of American turning its back on Godâtribulations that have been used to rally the faithful in his deeply religious state as he went from a quixotic Senate hopeful to the favorite. When Moore spoke to a Friday luncheon sponsored by the American Family Association, he was introduced unapologetically as someone who would put Christianity ahead of the Constitution. When a video played detailing the Ten Commandments saga in Alabama, the room of several hundred retirement-age attendees shook their heads in disgust. And when he took the stage, he stirred the crowd. âIt was never about the Ten Commandments; it was about the God who gave the Ten Commandments,â Moore said. âWe forget that what they really want to do in this land is remove the knowledge of God. That wonât happen, as far as I can see, because I think the people of God are rising up in this land today. In 2016 we were given a new lease, a new reason, and itâs upon us now.â Seated at the rear of the room, John and Jill Stabley nodded along. The older married couple from Delaware have attended the Values Voter Summit seven previous times, but this year feels different. âSuddenly hopeful,â Jill says. âWe grew up in an era where people were thinking of others, and trying to do the right thingâ.â John interrupts: âAnd walking with Christ.â He pauses. âThereâs no going back. All these outside people are coming in and tearing us apart.â By âoutside people,â John means immigrantsâparticularly Muslims, whom he says are undermining the Constitution in pursuit of sharia law. (John believes Obama is a Muslim, and Jill says the Common Core education standards were used to indoctrinate students with Islamic ideology.) The focus on immigration in these Christian circles speaks to the budding union between Trumpâs evangelical and nationalistic supporters, which was on display at Perkinsâ weekend event. He raised eyebrows by inviting former White House aides Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, the polarizing promoters of Trumpâs âAmerica Firstâ message, to speak at the event, despite neither having any roots in the Christian conservative universe. This shotgun wedding resulted in some predictably awkward moments. Bannon, emphasizing the importance of grass-roots politics in winning elections, raised the 44th presidentâs former job title. âWhatâs a community organizer? Iâll tell you what it is. Somebody that could kick your assâtwice.â There were crickets from the audience; it was almost certainly the first time someone had ever used a curse word during a speech to the Values Voter Summit. Earlier, in his own speech, Gorka had stressed how liberating it was for him and Bannon to now be working outside the White House. âThe left has no idea how much more damage we can do to them as private citizens,â he said to scattered applause. Responding to Gorka, conservative radio host Erick Erickson, a frequent Trump critic, tweeted, âSad to see this said at a Christian conference. Where is the grace? Where is the mercy? Where is the Christ?â These are good and fair questions. But anyone expecting the evangelical right to shy away from Trump worldâs hardball approach to politics hasnât been paying attention the past 18 months. Many Christian voters embraced Trump not despite his provocative style but because of it, betting on a brash street brawler to win the culture battles they had been losing for generations. And their faith has been rewarded: From abortion policy to religious liberty to judicial appointments, Trump has delivered for social conservatives more than any other constituency, making them the unlikely cornerstone of his coalition. With political victory, however, has come the loss of moral high ground for a faithful whose church-averse champion personifies much of what their scripture condemns. Itâs a trade-off plenty of conservative Christians, reeling from eight years in which they felt ostracized and demeaned by Obama, the media and popular culture, have proven eager to accept. Bannon and Gorka are now throwing the full weight of their populist movement behind Moore in Alabamaâa candidate who connects viscerally with faith voters on the basis of his objection to the physical removal of Godâs presence from American life. If he wins the Senate seat, a spiritual renaissance in America is unlikely to result. But something else will: a deepening alliance between economic nationalists and social conservatives, two distinct tribes that are growing codependent in the era of Trump. As Perkins now sees it, Republicans will win elections only by merging these factionsâhence his inviting Bannon and Gorka to speak. The president is right when he says, in the context of culture wars, that the times are changing. But itâs not just about Christians pursuing the return of a bygone, pious America. Itâs about what they are willing to sacrifice to get there. California By Jeremy B.

        "articles": "Bob and Maureen McDonnell's trial is expected to last at least five weeks. By ASSOCIATED PRESS 07/28/2014 07:20 AM EDT RICHMOND, Va. — Jury selection has begun Monday in the corruption trial of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife in Richmond. Bob and Maureen McDonnell are charged in a 14-count indictment with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from the CEO of a dietary supplements company in exchange for helping promote his products. Their trial in federal court is expected to last at least five weeks. Federal prosecutors filed a list of 61 potential witnesses, including Maureen McDonnell and the couple’s three children, Sean, Rachel and Bobby. During jury selection, Judge James R. Spencer read a list of possible defense witnesses, including Bob McDonnell, former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, and Virginia House Speaker William J. Howell. McDonnell was a rising national star in the Republican party and was considered a possible Mitt Romney running mate in 2012 before the federal investigation ruined his political future. Before being indicted 10 days after leaving office in January, McDonnell apologized for what he described as bad judgment and said he repaid about $120,000 in gifts and loans, but he denied breaking any laws. He and his lawyers have argued that prosecutors are trying to criminalize routine and long-accepted political courtesies, like hosting receptions and arranging meetings, that fall short of more tangible rewards historically associated with bribery. Prosecutors have countered that the McDonnells’ willingness to help former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams on “an as-needed basis” and Williams’ expectation of something in return, whether he received it or not, is enough to support a conviction. If the jury agrees, the McDonnells could face decades in prison. Williams is expected to testify under immunity as the prosecution’s star witness. According to the indictment, Williams lavished the McDonnells with designer clothes, golf outings, vacations and large loans while seeking government help promoting his company’s products and securing grants for research studies. No government grants were awarded, but the indictment says the McDonnells hosted or appeared at numerous events to further the company’s interests. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "In South Carolina, Hillary Clinton emphasized that she \"will not promise you something that I cannot deliver.\" | AP Photo By STEVEN SHEPARD 02/12/2016 09:30 PM EST DENMARK, S.C. – Hillary Clinton, making her first appearance in South Carolina on Friday since her blowout loss in New Hampshire earlier this week, did not sound like a candidate sitting on a big lead. Clinton’s pitch here was tailored to African-American voters, who made up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate eight years ago, when Barack Obama catapulted over Clinton following a resounding victory in this state. She wasn’t campaigning in vote-rich Columbia or Charleston – she was here in majority-black Bamberg County for a town-hall meeting before jetting off to Nevada for the final week before the caucuses there. The former secretary of state opened her remarks inside an elementary-school gymnasium, decrying underfunded schools and infrastructure in the Interstate-95 corridor and comparing it to the plight of the largely African-American residents of Flint, Michigan, where Clinton visited earlier this week. “I went to Flint, Michigan, on Sunday, because there we have children being poisoned by lead in the water as a result of the governor of their state trying to save money,” Clinton said. But she quickly pivoted to a spirited critique of Sanders, with whom she sparred Thursday night in a primary debate in Milwaukee. “Here’s what I want you to know: I’m not a single-issue candidate, and this is not a single-issue country,” Clinton said, adding that she and Sanders largely agreed on increased regulation of the financial services industry. By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE She also suggested Sanders’ policies wouldn’t help the event’s mostly African-American audience. “[Even] if we enacted our toughest plans to rein in Wall Street and shadow banking,” Clinton said, “I’d worry that we’d still have lead in the water in Flint, and we’d still have deteriorating schools here in South Carolina.” “I will not promise you something that I cannot deliver,” Clinton added. “I will not make promises I know I cannot keep. We don’t need any more of that.” Clinton rolled out a $125-billion proposal “to expand jobs and to invest in infrastructure and housing in communities of color and rural communities” that she said was modeled on a plan put forth by Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), the only Democratic member of the state’s congressional delegation and a long-time political leader here. The funding, she said, would come from “a tax on the largest and riskiest financial institutions.” “Those that contributed to the great recession are going to contribute to bringing back the communities that were the hardest hit by the great recession,” she said. The South Carolina primaries are split. While Republicans are gathering upstate this weekend for the final televised debate before the Feb. 20 primary, Democrats have another week of campaigning before voters head to the polls, with Nevada coming first. But while the low-turnout Nevada caucuses are a test of organization, the first-in-the-South Democratic primary on Feb. 27 is a test of Clinton’s firewall: minority voters, who haven’t yet jumped on the Sanders bandwagon. In order to hold onto a significant edge in polls conducted last month, Clinton needs to sustain her initial base of support among African-American voters as Sanders attempts to broaden his appeal and make inroads in minority communities, especially among younger voters, who have backed him in big numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire. By NICK GASS One irony of places like Denmark as Clinton’s base: These weren’t Clinton Country in 2008. She won just 28 percent of the vote in Bamberg County in the 2008 primary, as more than 63 percent of Democrats chose Barack Obama – about 8 points greater than his statewide percentage. Indeed, the loudest cheers at Friday’s town-hall meeting were when Clinton invoked the name of her one-time rival for the nomination – and when she hit Sanders for the Vermont independent’s Democratic apostasies during the Obama administration. “As I pointed out last night, he has called the president weak, a disappointment, he tried to get some attention to attract a candidate to actually run against the president when he was running for reelection,” Clinton said. “He does not support, the way I do, building on the progress the president has made. And that includes building on the Affordable Care Act.” Clinton’s final appeal, before taking questions from the audience here, was on electability. “In the next two weeks, people here in South Carolina are going to get the chance to express your opinion,” she said. “You are choosing someone you want to be the Democratic nominee to be president and commander-in-chief – and able to take on and defeat whoever the Republicans put up. Because we must keep the White House.” \u0002 Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for  Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox. © 2021  LLC",

By BRIANNA EHLEY 02/20/2017 06:02 AM EST Updated 02/20/2017 05:54 PM EST Vice President Mike Pence was one of the GOP governors who had agreed to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, albeit with certain conservative tweaks. | AP Photo When then-Gov. Mike Pence faced the worst public health crisis to hit Indiana in decades, he turned to Obamacare — a program he vilified and voted against. In 2015, as a rash of HIV infections spread through rural southern Indiana, state health officials parachuted into Scott County and enrolled scores of people into Obamacare's expanded Medicaid program so they could get medical care and substance abuse treatment. Many were addicted to opioids and had contracted HIV by sharing dirty needles. Two years later, Pence is helping to lead the Republican effort to dismantle the program that helped him halt the deadly outbreak in an impoverished swathe of Indiana. \"These are good salt-of-the-earth folks who got caught up in a disaster. Not funding this would be like removing sandbags during a flood,” said Blake Johnson, who helps people in Scott County enroll in health coverage on behalf of Covering Kids & Families of Indiana, a nonprofit patient group. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump had been among several GOP presidential candidates who talked about the plight of Americans addicted to opioids. “I would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment,” Trump said last fall, three weeks before his election. He also talked about dismantling Obamacare and turning Medicaid into a block grant program — an approach that caps federal support and could force states to cut benefits or eligibility. By MADELINE CONWAY Pence was one of the GOP governors who had agreed to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, albeit with certain conservative tweaks. He signed his state’s Medicaid expansion known as the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 in 2015 — the same year as the HIV outbreak. Some Pence critics have said his strong anti-abortion stance, which led Indiana to close several Planned Parenthood clinics including one in Scott County, may have worsened the outbreak by making HIV testing less accessible. His health department relied heavily on the program to respond to the HIV crisis in southern Indiana. Officials set up a “one-stop-shop,” next to a free needle exchange, in the tiny, impoverished town of Austin, and offered hot meals, HIV screenings, vaccinations and assistance to help people enroll in insurance — many for the first time — through HIP 2.0. Within a month, about 168 people were approved for the program, according to figures provided by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration. About 2,280 people in the Scott County are currently enrolled, many of whom are now getting substance abuse treatment. “A lack of health insurance was one of the first barriers to testing and treatment identified in Scott County,” said Jeni O’Malley, a spokesperson for the Indiana State Department of Health. “HIP 2.0 helped address that gap and opened doors to medical care and treatment that have been life-changing for people living with HIV and hepatitis C.” Clients could get new needles as part of the needle-exchange program in Indiana in 2015. | AP Photo Health insurance is pivotal for HIV patients, since their condition is chronic and requires consistent treatment and medication. And since the outbreak in Scott County was fueled by people contracting the infection by sharing needles, many were in need of robust substance abuse treatment services that are also covered through HIP 2.0. The Affordable Care Act provided money to fully fund expanded Medicaid through 2016, but the share of the government’s tab dips gradually to 90 percent by 2020. Under the law, eligibility was expanded to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,400 for an individual, and was no longer limited to pregnant women, children, or the disabled. Pence put a conservative spin on the program by requiring enrollees to make monthly contributions — $1 a month for many. But people with HIV and chronic substance abuse disorders are exempt from such contributions and also qualify for enhanced benefits such as vision, dental and nonemergency transportation. The plan covers outpatient services and case management programs that are essential for people with chronic conditions like HIV. Now, health care providers and patient advocates are nervously watching the Obamacare repeal debate play out in Washington, worried about what might happen if HIP funding goes away and the law’s coverage of mental health services is weakened. “We are currently in a panic about what’s going to happen,” said Jaymes Young, a medical case manager for The Damien Center, the largest AIDS service organization in the state. A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that coverage for people with HIV increased significantly as a result of the law's Medicaid expansion. White House By MATTHEW NUSSBAUM and HENRY C. JACKSON Another study published in Health Affairs found that fewer uninsured HIV patients were hospitalized in states that had expanded Medicaid. In fact, between 2012 and the middle of 2014, the percentage of hospitalizations among uninsured HIV patients dropped from 13.7 percent to 5.5 percent since more people had coverage. Meanwhile, in states that didn't expand Medicaid, the percentage of hospitalizations for uninsured HIV patients rose from 14.5 percent to 15.7 percent. Researchers also found that HIV patients without health insurance were nearly 40 percent more likely to die during their hospital stay, compared to those with health insurance. To be sure, HIV-positive patients in Indiana may get coverage through other sources, including traditional Medicaid, insurance funded through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program and commercial coverage on the exchanges. But HIP 2.0 was particularly important for this population because it provides substance abuse and mental health treatment that includes case management and even non-emergency transportation to get people to doctors’ appointments and therapy sessions. Pence, a longtime Obamacare foe who voted against its 2010 passage as a lawmaker, has assured people in his state that HIP 2.0 will remain even if the law is repealed, portraying it as an innovative state program that he suggests is unconnected to Obamacare. In an op-ed published in the Indianapolis Star last year before he was tapped to be vice president, Pence said, “HIP will exist after the ACA.” though he conceded the program would be altered. “Of course, when Obamacare is repealed, there will need to be a transition period...allowing a new administration in Washington the ability to reform Medicaid and provide states even more flexibility to innovate and strengthen programs like HIP 2.0,” Pence wrote. The Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill support making Medicaid a block grant program that would provide a set amount of funding to every state based on its number of enrollees. While federal spending would be capped, states would have more flexibility about how to spend the money. Health Care By PAUL DEMKO Providers and caregivers in Indiana worry the switch will harm patients. “Hopefully the ACA stays,” said Young of The Damien Center. “It was complicated and imperfect but now we’re used to it. More changes will do damage to our clients. Even Republican state lawmakers are concerned about change. “We've made great strides serving a very vulnerable, high-risk population with HIP 2.0,” said state Rep. Ed Clere, who chaired the House health committee around the time of the HIV outbreak. Clere added that he is open to block granting, but \"it shouldn't limit access, It has to be for the right reasons. It can’t just be about saving the federal government money.\" The threat of Obamacare repeal comes even as Indiana officials are asking the Trump administration to tweak its own Medicaid expansion program. The updated waiver proposal vastly expands substance abuse treatment coverage to anyone in Medicaid and includes inpatient, as well as outpatient, treatment for substance abuse. “The expanded access we seek through this waiver extension will prove critical” Pence’s successor, Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb, wrote in a letter to the Trump administration. The waiver application, which was largely crafted by Seema Verma, Trump’s pick to lead CMS, is expected to be approved. However, if the ACA is repealed, the program’s future is unclear. “It’s been a miracle for Indiana,” said Susan Jo Thomas, the executive director at Covering Kids and Families of Indiana. “I don’t want to talk or think about the consequences of losing it. It’s terrifying.” Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for  Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox. © 2021  LLC",

By GLENN THRUSH and ANNIE KARNI January 20, 2016 Glenn Thrush is âs chief political correspondent. Annie Karni is a politics reporter at . AMES, IowaâBob Summerfelt dutifully sat through Hillary Clintonâs one-hour policy dissertation at a campus auditorium here, dutifully stuck the Hillary sticker (upside down) to his fleece, dutifully declared how phenomenally well-prepared she was, truly, for the presidency. So would he caucus for her on February 1? The 80-year-old former Iowa State fish and wildlife professor, sheepishly dropped his gaze to his shoe tops. His wife, Deanne, who is all in for Hillary, rolled her eyes. âActually, uh, Iâm for Bernie,â he said. âItâs a funny story,â he continued. âMy 19-year-old grandson has come to live with us while he goes to school here. ... And we began talking about it, about economic inequality and all of that. ... I think Hillary is inevitable, and Iâll vote for her later, but my grandson really convinced me to vote for Sanders. So Iâm going to carpool him and all his friends to the caucuses. Several carloads of them, I think.â Over the past nine months, the Clinton team has recited their collective talking-point mantra that she was always expecting a tough fight here, no matter who her primary opponent was, and that she would earn every vote. But privately, they didnât expect it to be nearly this closeâand Clinton herself has scoffed at the idea that Democratic voters would ever really pick âa socialistâ over someone so manifestly prepared to be president, according to people in her orbit. After her humbling third-place finish behind Barack Obama and John Edwards in 2008, Hillary Clinton hit the caucus state this year with an eye on not just victory, but redemption, committing money, time and an immense ground operation in an effort not only to beat Sanders but vanquish the ghosts of â08. Instead, she has watched a sickening slow-motion sequel. Bernie Sanders is no Obama, the original anti-Hillary, but heâs pushing her to the edge. With only two weeks to go before the caucuses, Sanders pulled within 2 percentage points in the latest Des Moines Register poll released last week. The problem, according to interviews with two dozen Clinton insiders and Iowa operatives, isnât with Clintonâs new and improved operation, but with a candidate hampered by her old, familiar limitations. All the door-knocking, phone-banking, motivated volunteers (there really are hundreds of them) and pizza-fueled pep sessions at Clintonâs downtown Des Moines headquarters canât alter an immutable fact about the woman at the center of it all: She isnât an Iowa kind of candidate, never has been, and isnât going to shape-shift into one by the end of the month. Part of it is Iowa, a state where roughly four in 10 Democrats self-identify as socialists. But the political MRI of the caucus has revealed that Hillary â16 is essentially the same mixed-bag candidate sheâs always been: amply informed but often uninspiring, more focused on the tactical task of fileting her opponent than the strategic imperative of delivering a succinct, appealing messageâan establishment fixture in an era of populist statue-smashing. Hillary Clinton has adapted lessons from her Iowa loss in 2008; she now reads out the names of local volunteers at every rally, a practice Obama enshrined in 2008. At left, volunteers display signs outside a campaign event for Clinton in Toledo, Iowa, this week; right, a volunteer carries a roll of campaign stickers in Waterloo. | AP Photos âThere are certain elements of Hillary Clinton that are just unfixable,â said one Democratic consultant who has worked with her on previous campaigns. âSince 2008, Clintonâs people have been pretty smart about putting together a really first-rate organization,â says Jeff Link, a Des Moines-based consultant with close ties to former Sen. Tom Harkin, long the stateâs dominant Democrat. âIn the last eight years she gained all this experience at the State Department, which is great. But experience is not something voters are dying for right now.â Still, Sanders has his own weaknessesânamely, a late-to-the-game field operation that is struggling mightily to harness his momentum into an effective organization. And itâs Sanders who has the most to lose: He has enough cash to campaign for months, but a Clinton win here could be a coup de grâce, nullifying his probable win in New Hampshire and giving her momentum heading into Nevada and South Carolina where she, not he, has an inherent advantage. And Clinton remains a formidable front-runner who stands an even-odds chance of winning. Staffers say she is much more personally engaged in the details this time than in 2008, and over the past year has assembled the most formidable field and data-gathering organization on the ground here in all 99 countiesâan organizing push overseen by a young operative who ran Obamaâs Cedar Rapids operation eight years ago. Even the selection of her top campaign brass back in Brooklyn reflects her focus on Iowa. Campaign manager Robby Mook has made it clear the bulk of the campaignâs resources, as well as the candidateâs time, would be deployed to the first four states, with a major focus here. In interviews, Mookâa highly skilled field organizerâoften begs off questions about a general election strategy and dodges discussion of the big March states with an intense focus instead on the first four states, led by Iowa. Whatâs left is a sprint on a flat track pitting Clintonâs army of organizers and data crunchers against Sandersâ free-jazz attempt to convert raw enthusiasm into caucus votes, and in a hurry. âThis isnât 2008,â said one architect of Barack Obamaâs groundbreaking strategy eight years ago. âBut if you ask me which Iâd takeâa great organization or great voter enthusiasmâIâd take voter enthusiasm every single time.â Momentum, for the moment, seems to be on Sandersâ side. At the Hamburg Inn restaurant in Iowa City (like Ames, another Sanders-friendly college town), a popular pit stop for politicians (Obama and Clinton regularly dropped in eight years ago to nibble on crinkle fries), customers are encouraged to drop a coffee bean in a row of jars labeled for each candidate. One Clinton volunteer who recently stopped by said she was dismayed to see the status of the jars. Hillary Clintonâs sat mostly empty. Sanders had received so many beans theyâd had to put out a second jar. It was overflowing, too. *** In The Arena By Jack Kennedy Schlossberg Opinion By Barney Frank Political Science By Matthew MacWilliams For both Clintons, Iowa isnât just a state, itâs a taunt. Bill Clinton never competed in the 1992 caucuses, ceding victory to native son Harkin, and he still wishes heâd given Harkin a challenge. A few years back, the hypercompetitive former president approached Harkin to tell him that not being able to run here âwas just about the biggest regret in my political life,â according to a Democrat who witnessed the exchange. For Hillary Clinton, never the type of retail politician her husband was, Iowa âis simply not a great fit,â in the words of one top adviser, speaking a few months ago. In Game Change, the candidate dramatically turned to her husband in the shabby presidential suite of the Hotel Forth Des Moines on that fateful caucus night to pronounce self-pityingly, âMaybe they just donât like me.â That wasnât true. Iowa liked Hillary Clinton just fineâbut not nearly as much as they loved Obama or even the as-yet-untainted John Edwards. Clinton spent $30 million in the state and won 70,000 votes, a blockbuster majority in any other year when the average caucus turnout would have been 120,000 or 130,000. Instead, the Obama ground operation helped jack the turnout up to an astonishing 240,000. The Obama victory ranks among the biggest political coups in decades. His team, led by campaign manager David Plouffe and field-ops specialist Paul Tewes, threw all the campaignâs local resources into a risky Iowa-or-bust strategy. It centered on an âunusual suspectsâ approachâgalvanizing participation among the tens of thousands of fired-up-ready-to-go young voters who had been thought too flaky and distracted to caucusâdriven by a novel, hugely successful reading of how Iowa really works. âThe usual theory is that you just work the previous caucus-goer lists,â Tewes recalled. âThis originates from the myth that caucus participation is a regular thing. It isnât. Competitive caucuses happen once every four, eight, even 12 years, so itâs not like a regular pattern for people. You have to start with the destruction of that myth. The crowds we were getting were just unbelievable, so we had to figure out a way to turn them into caucusgoers.â This time around, Clintonâs organizers (many of them Obama alums) have updated or adopted many of the data and organizing techniques used by Obamaâs team. But for all the talk of lessons learned, sheâs actually implementing a much older and more conventional pre-Obama strategyâharkening back to the 2000 and â04 racesârooted in her appeal to a fixed group of older voters. The idea, people close to the campaign say, is less about generating buzz than securing Krazy Glue commitments from previous caucus-goers. To the extent that Clintonâs team, led by veteran Iowa operative Matt Paul, is seeking to expand the electorate, itâs by targeting the smaller universe of 20,000 or so committed Democrats who donât usually caucus. Several insiders told us Mook, who ran Clintonâs successful Nevada operation in 2008, has been closely overseeing day-to-day operations from the day he took the helm, coordinating with his friend and protégé Michael Halle, a highly regarded Obama 2008 veteran. Mook thought about tapping Halle as state director, two people close to the campaign told , but the candidate valued Paulâs connections with state political and labor leaders, and Paul got the nod. A loss here, Mook has told his staff, would force Clinton to pour resources into Super Tuesday states she hoped to win on the cheap. âRobby has a lot on the line here,â said a Clinton ally. âThat kind of organizing is his bailiwick.â Clinton's campaign leadership may be the biggest difference between her 2008 campaign, helmed largely by strategist Mark Penn, left, and her 2016 one, led by Robby Mook, right. While Penn was said to have urged Clinton to skip the caucuses altogether, Mook, says one Clinton ally, âhas a lot on the line here. That kind of organizing is his bailiwick.â | Getty Images This close involvement by her Brooklyn campaign brass may be the biggest difference between 2008 and 2016. During Clintonâs first tilt here, many in her camp urged her to skip the caucuses altogether (Several former staffers implicated chief strategist Mark Penn â even though he wasnât on the internal distribution list for the memo) and the candidateâs head was never really in the game. In May 2007, someone leaked a memo from a deputy campaign manager urging Clinton to pull out of Iowa to downplay expectations and better focus on the voter-rich Super Tuesday states. What happened over the next few months was a blur of badâObama rocketing into rock-star status; a bitter Clinton battling the press and her own staffâculminating in the infamous decision to buy thousands of snow shovels to clear out voter driveways for a snowless caucus day and defeat. Under Mook, the staff is better organized and less fractious. âI have a much better organization than I did back in 2008,â Clinton told MSNBCâs Rachel Maddow earlier this month. âI have an organization that is a great mixture of people who worked for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, people who worked for me, people new to the process. Iâve got a lot of confidence in them, what theyâre doing.â That confidence isnât without justification. Her team has been in place since March 2015âand they have executed their plan, even if the candidate hasnât always executed hers. For reasons that arenât clear, Clinton is doing fewer events here than in 2008âbut they seem better geared to hammering home the point that sheâs a humble Midwesterner asking ever-so-nicely for votes. Gone are the large, impersonal rallies that Iowa caucus-goers found distant and insulting eight years ago; gone is the âHill-o-Copterâ chopper she traveled in eight years back, and the 30,000-foot view it implied. This time, Clinton is going for up close and personal. At her first campaign stop last year, she started out sitting around three folding tables with six community college students in a garage where they learned to fix cars. She nodded. She took notes on a yellow legal pad. She showed an uncanny ability to remember peopleâs names. She was really connecting. It was going to be different this time. *** Between April and November, Clintonâs ground organization dwarfed Sandersâ, even as he began attracting the big crowds. At his early rallies in cities like Davenport, 2,000 people would leave feeling inspired, but the campaign had only two staffers on the ground in the spring and relied instead on volunteers trained just an hour before the event to help it capture the voters. And Clintonâs people noticed that at big events where both candidates appearedâlike the Democratic Hall of Fame dinner in Cedar Rapids and the North Iowa Wing Ding in Clear Lakeâthey were collecting more commitment cards from their supporters than the Sanders people were hoovering up. âWhen you have people come to an event in Iowa, you really need to contact them within 72 hours to get them engaged in the campaign,â said the former Obama Iowa organizer. The tortoise hoped to outwork the hare: Clintonâs staff concedes their events are smaller, but everyone who enters her rallies is asked to sign in at the doorâand the campaign almost always follows up. Sanders estimates heâs spoken to 40,000 Iowans since launching his campaign hereâbut and itâs not clear whether heâs establishing caucus-night commitments from them. The Clinton campaign, by contrast, is efficient, metrics-obsessed: Over the past two weekends, for instance, it has sent hundreds of volunteers on sub-zero door-knocking runsâand 80 percent have showed up, an unusually high percentage, according to a campaign official. David Axelrod, who helped create Obamaâs blockbuster hope-and-change message eight years ago, says Clinton, for all of her obsession with âtactics,â still has an advantage over Sanders: âMessage and enthusiasm alone isnât enough, especially in Iowa,â he added. âWe built the best organization that state has ever seen. Without it, we wouldn't have won.â But itâs not just about showing up. Passion is the fuel that runs the turnout machine. In Waterloo last week, Hillary Clinton stood before an audience of about 350 peopleâaverage age 60-plusâat a dance hall just up the road from a big John Deere plant. The polite, mostly female crowd was excited to see her, but Clintonâs performance didnât quite match the venueâs nameâthe Electric Park Ballroom. Clintonâs demeanor varies widely from event to event, and here she seemed less interested in reading the room than delivering a rambling, State-of-the-Unionesque list of achingly specific policy proposals on everything from taxes to autism to green energy research. She was there to deliver a new proposal meant to outflank Sanders on income inequalityâa 4 percent tax on taxpayers who earn more than $5 million per yearâbut it was buried in a pile of other ideas, and too complicated to capture the imagination of an audience that came to life when she finally began talking about her little granddaughter Charlotte. Clintonâs staff concedes their events are smaller than Sanders' rallies, but their metrics-obsessed approach has retained high volumes of volunteers, they say. Sanders estimates heâs spoken to 40,000 Iowans since launching his campaign here, including at a campaign stop, above, in Fort Dodge. But itâs not clear if heâs establishing caucus-night commitments from them. | AP Photo As part of her lessons-learned campaign, Clinton now pulls out a handwritten piece of paper at every rally to read out the names of local volunteers and organizers by nameâa practice Obama (who often had their names memorized) enshrined in 2008. Later, we asked one of the people Clinton mentioned onstage, a veteran Democratic field operative tasked with securing the coin-of-the-realm commitment cards from supporters, what message was connecting. It contradicted Clintonâs laundry-list approach. âYou stand there and tell them all about the details of her college plan and you just see their eyes go,â he said, rolling his for emphasis. âThey are worried about the economy, itâs getting better, but they are still not doing that well. What they want to talk about is pretty straightforwardâthe minimum wage and income inequality, that sort of thing.â Clinton has always suffered from a kind of political multiple personality disorderâand her message remains every bit as muddled as it was in 2008. â[Obama] had a clear message of generational change and we, well, we were talking about experience and competence and whatever the hell else we were talking about,â one Clinton 2008 veteran told us. âIt seems like the same thing is happening again this time.â To halt Sandersâ momentum, she is forced to attack. (The Clintons, one person who is close to both told us, have been the most enthusiastic proponents of slamming Sanders hard all last week.) But that creates a self-perpetuating cycle, defining Clinton as a cynical politician while buttressing Sandersâ brand as a joyous populist warrior. Even Clinton loyalists arenât quite buying the bad-Bernie routine. âThereâs something very cute about Bernie,â said Clinton stalwart Bonnie Campbell, a former state attorney general. âHe can get this mischievous look on his face ... you just want to smooth his hair out and calm down his hands.â *** But itâs the clarity of his message, not appearance, thatâs brought him from 50 points down in national polls to par in Iowa. Heâd never spent much time in the state before this campaign, but heâs turned out to be heartland naturalâBrooklyn Socialist plus rural Vermont somehow adds up to Iowa Democrat in 2016. Last week, at Pleasantville High School, about 45 minutes outside Des Moines, Sanders turned his stump speech into an interactive, Dead Poetsâ Society-style, government class. Another advantage for Sandersâone people who havenât visited his events donât seeâis his freedom: He doesnât inhabit the same security bubble that traps Clinton behind a wall of security and staff. Unlike Clinton events, there was no security check-in, and no long, fidgety wait with Katy Perry and Jennifer Lopez hits blasting over the sound system, no organizers killing time for her arrival on the mic waiting for the candidate to arrive. He is obsessed with punctuality and arrived on time to deliver his message on a bare stage. Standing in front of an auditorium filled with about 500 people, he roamed freely across the stage in his ill-fitting suit, like he was delivering a Bernie TED talkâa shtick he perfected back in Vermont. âIncome and wealth inequality,â he launched in, âyou all know what I mean by that? If I am a high school graduate, and Iâm going out looking for work, tell me about that experience. Anyone want to talk to me about that?â Next, he pressed the students to explain how politicians fund their campaigns. âThey get the money by succumbing to corporate interests,â volunteered a student named Max. âI agree with Max!â Sanders thunderedâand the crowd roared. Sanders, whose unkempt appearance belies iron discipline as a politician, has gained strength because of his strict adherence to his core message thatâlike his baggy suitsâdonât need to be tailored to fit a new crowd. But in his events on Monday, he focused on issues students care aboutâtuition-free college, raising the minimum wage, equal pay, immigration, guns and weed. âWhat should we do with marijuana? Give me some ideas.â The crowd giggled. âMake it legal!â someone yelled out, as he smiled. The exchange wasnât especially memorableâbut it underscored the easy, unspoken bond a politician whoâs really connecting has with his supporters. Afterward, there was no rope line, no crush for selfies. He simply left with his wife Jane, escorted by a few staffers, and forgot to even tell the crowd to get out and caucus on February 1. Thatâs not so goodâbecause Sanders needs big caucus turnout to win. Nobody knows how many people will show up (the weather plays a major role, hence the bulk snow shovel buy) but in a dozen interviews with Democratic leaders in the state the estimate were a good-but-not-crazy 140,000 to 160,000. Those arenât Obama numbers, but like Obama, Sanders is expanding the electorate here, particularly among the 18- to 35-year-olds. Speaking to reporters last week in Pleasantville, Sanders conceded that pulling off an Obama-style victory is a long shot. âI don't know that we can do as well as Barack Obama did in 2008,â he said. When it comes to organization, Sandersâ campaign has been late to the party and flying by the seat of the candidateâs wrinkled pants. State coordinator Pete DâAlessandroâformer Iowa Gov. Chet Culverâs political directorâwas Sandersâ first hire here, and joined the campaign on May 29, but things got off to a slow start. That late May weekend, Sanders was planning to barnstorm the state with three large ralliesâhe had no one to help him hand out caucus cards or gather peopleâs information for follow up, the exercise was essentially useless from an organizing standpoint. âHe was coming in with nothing but volunteers,â DâAlessandro recalled. Now, with plenty of money (Sanders raised an eye-popping $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2015) to hire a real team, DâAlessandro has quickly built up the organization to 101 paid staffers in Iowa. And, despite Clintonâs strength with blacks and Hispanics nationally, Sandersâfrom snow-white Vermontâis hoping to attract the small but significant pool of young minority voters. In 2007, the League of United Latin American Citizensâa local advocacy groupâidentified 23,000 Latino voters in Iowa. In the intervening nine years, according to the groupâs national vice president, Joe Henry, that number has swelled to 49,000. âA lot of young people seem to be going with Bernie,â Henry said. âIf youâre looking at a campaign that works on regular caucus goers, clearly itâs Hillary Clinton, who is doing the traditional approach. Who is best organized, in terms of an Obama-style grass-roots campaign? Itâs Bernie Sanders.â Moreover, Sanders is intent on out-hustling Clinton, who has abandoned the five-event-a-day approach she fruitlessly adopted eight years ago. Last Monday, he held three events across the state ahead of a Democratic forum here, while Clinton held just one. In December, Sanders held 22 events in the state, compared to Clintonâs 10. And this month, so far, Clinton has held 16 events compared to 19 for Sanders, according to the Des Moines Registerâs candidate tracker. *** Itâs a long-forgotten fact, but Clinton finally did find her voice late in the 2008 Iowa campaign and carried her working-class-warrior message to New Hampshire where she scored a major upset. There are hints of a reprise. Clinton events tend to draw a higher percentage of undecided voters than Sanders rallies, her staff says, but in Waterloo, roughly half the attendees cheerfully filled out commitment cards after the event and many offered to volunteer. âI want to see a woman president in my lifetime,â said 85-year-old Marlee Ryan, a retired board of education employee. âIf we had a woman president, trust me, we wouldnât have a lot of this bullcrap.â And day after that muddled performance, Clintonâspeaking at Iowa State University in Amesâwas in sharper mid-â08 form, lashing Sanders for voting against a bill that would have allowed victims of gun violence to sue manufacturers for damages. (He reversed his position a couple of days later.) Clinton is applauded at a rally this week in Waterloo. Clinton's compelling campaign message in 2008 developed just in time to win the New Hampshire primary. Campaign observers say there are hints of a reprise in Iowa. | AP Photo The audience of around 400âwhich had braved cloudless 1-degree temperatures and a biting westerly windâseemed genuinely energized and rushed out to the lobby to sign their pledge cards. But this was a Clinton rally, and this was Iowa, so the sunny day wasnât entirely without shadow. To ensure that college students were represented among Clintonâs AARP faithful, the organizers offered last-minute tickets to three classes in the schoolâincluding a batch to Sarah Vanceâs ballroom dancing class. When the instructor announced the opportunity, one kid booed and shouted âI donât like Hillary!â and all but 10 of 30 students wandered off. âIt was rude and stupid,â the 22-year-old senior from Davenport said. âI mean why would anyone skip the chance to see someone who might be the first woman president of the United States?â But would she caucus for Clinton? âIâm definitely thinking about it!â she said.

        "articles": "'He stands for everything America doesn’t,' Reid says of Cruz. | John Shinkle/ By TAL KOPAN 10/31/2013 06:38 AM EDT Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says a part of him thinks it would be good for Sen. Ted Cruz to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016, because it would end the GOP. Reid sat down with Rachel Maddow for her MSNBC show for an interview that aired Wednesday, and she asked the Nevada Democrat about the political capital and fundraising the Texas Republican got out of the government shutdown. “If I didn’t care so much about our country, I would hope he would get the Republican nomination for president, because that would mean the end of the Republican Party,” Reid said. “With Ted Cruz, I am sure this will help him raise more money.” ( PHOTOS: Harry Reid’s career) The majority leader said what Cruz represents is antithetical to the United States. “He stands for everything America doesn’t,” Reid said. Reid said the Republican Party has been damaged by the government shutdown and he doesn’t believe they’ll risk another. “The Republican Party is staggering right now. Any poll, have Rush Limbaugh run a poll. No matter who did the poll, this has really hurt Republicans what they’ve done,” Reid said, saying the GOP has offended “everybody” with recent agendas. “I don’t know who they can expect to have a vote for them. I don’t see it. So they’re not going to do it again, is what I’m saying.” ( PHOTOS: Key quotes from Ted Cruz) He also said he’s not as concerned about the tea party Republicans who drove the GOP through the shutdown, but rather the other members of the party that went along with it, voting to repeal Obamacare 45 times. “My disappointment in all of this is not the 80 or 90 people who live in some other political world that I don’t understand. But my disappointment is the so-called moderates who went along with this vote after vote after vote,” Reid said. “Einstein said this, pure definition of insanity is somebody who does something over and over and over again and expects a different result. So that was my No. 1 concern, that these so-called moderate Republicans went along with this crazy stuff.” ( QUIZ: Do you know Ted Cruz?) Reid also addressed recent reports that Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) called him an a—hole, dismissing the incident as over. “I’m sure he didn’t mean it,” Reid said. “We had a meeting. It’s all over with.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Fourth Estate The president knows it’s easier—and often more effective—to bluster than actually make good on his intimidation. Alex Wong/Getty Images Opinion by JACK SHAFER 05/27/2020 05:16 PM EDT Link Copied Jack Shafer is ’s senior media writer. Donald Trump issues threats with the frequency other people take out the garbage. This week he’s threatening to regulate or shutter Twitter for placing a fact-checking mark on his spurious tweet about mail-in voting. He has threatened people and institutions with libel suits. He has made economic threats against corporations (General Motors, AT&T; NBC; NFL; foreign automakers) whose business practices offend him. He has threatened to adjourn Congress, not something that appears to be within his power. He has encouraged violence against protesters at his rallies. He has threatened to withhold wildfire aid to California, to fire government employees (Robert Mueller; Rod Rosenstein), and to close the Mexican border. He has threatened allies (South Korea; NATO) as well as adversaries (North Korea; Iran). He has threatened to investigate both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. He threatened to release nonexistent tape recordings of his conversations with FBI Director James B. Comey. Once, he even threatened a Time magazine photographer with prison for taking a picture of a letter from Kim Jong Un that he was brandishing in the Oval Office. And that’s just an overview (see CNN and the Washington Post’’s roundups and New York Times coverage of Trump’s threats). More recently, Trump ordered states to reopen but then threatened forced shutdowns if it turned out he disliked the reopening plans. Trump isn’t the first president to issue ultimatums. Remember Obama’s “red line in Syria” speech? The press and the opposition—quite rightly—never allowed Obama to forget his empty words. But Trump has an easier time skating away every time he puts somebody on notice and then does nothing. If you tabulated an ultimatum line score between Trump and his predecessors, Trump would be the easy winner. Trump’s penchant for ultimatum-making—like his penchant for lying—appears to be congenital. Thrusting his forepaws in somebody’s face, baring his teeth and snarling was bringing him joy long before he moved into the White House. As his former lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress, Trump directed him to make at least 500 threats to businesses and journalists over 10 years of representation. During a 2015 phone call in which Cohen famously told a Daily Beast reporter he could expect a $500 million libel suit if he published a story, Cohen went on to imply violence. “I’m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I’m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. You understand me?” Cohen said to the reporter. The difference between a businessman making threats and a president, as scholar Jennifer Mercieca has written, is that a president possesses the coercive power to make good on the intimidating words that a businessman does not. It may be outside Trump’s direct power to shut down Twitter or issue a murder warrant for Joe Scarborough, but just the idea that he could encourage officials with regulatory or police powers to do so is intimidation enough. He deliberately serves notice to those who disagree with or oppose him that they can see their business destroyed, face a murder investigation or get a punch in the face. While President Trump has consummated some of his dire warnings—instituting tariffs, closing the government over the border wall, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and canceling the Iran nuclear deal—most but not all of his saber-rattling is empty. By mixing up the real with the fake threats, Trump keeps everybody on edge, wondering if this time he’ll follow through. The constant stream of threats enslaves the news media to Trump, and their reports terrify his targets. Just look at the way his threats to defund states that rely on postal voting have scattered the Democrats and united his supporters. He’s made the perfectly normal act of voting by mail sound fraudulent and planted seeds, at least among his supporters, that the November election is doomed to be tainted. A Trump threat like this also foists make-work on reporters who are dispatched to answer the question, “Can he really defund a postal voting state?” Trump did it again on May 23, when he vowed he would “override“ any governor who did not allow houses of worship to reopen over the weekend. His White House did not and would not explain what governmental power Trump was invoking to order the states around. Three days after the announcement, Trump still couldn’t cite what authority gave him the right to make governors stand down. Even if a state attorney general assures a governor that Trump can’t legally punish his defiance, what governor wants to force the test match? No less a liberal luminary than Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, who has been savaged by Trump, just admitted she censors herself when talking about him publicly. Trump doesn’t pay a political price for his threatmanship for a couple of reasons. First, even though we act like we think Trump means all of the wild things he says, 3½ years of his presidency have conditioned us to understand that much of what he says is bluster and that we should wait for action before we scramble the jets. Second, we tend to let many of the outlandish things Trump says slide because the last thing Democrats want to do is hold his feet to the fire and force him to make good on his threats. In a weird sort of gentleman’s agreement, Trump gets to say wild things and the Democrats get to shout back their displeasure until the portable outrage generator runs out of fuel and a peaceful silence returns. Except for when it doesn’t. It would be convenient to discover in Trump’s threat management evidence of a diabolical genius at work, but no such luck. Trump blusters and bullies because it’s an easily deployed, emotional technique that works for him. He thinks threats make him look strong and decisive—especially when he’s not—and that there is no such thing as going too far. (Witness his increased bullying of MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, whom he wants investigated for murder in the death 19 years ago of one of his staffers—a completely unfounded accusation, of course.) The most frightening thing about Trump’s threats is not the harm caused to Twitter or Scarborough or to the family of the woman Trump maintains was the victim, although that harm is very real. It’s that some day Trump will use these same techniques to make an extraordinary geopolitical threat and when his bluff is called by a foreign power he’ll learn, to the nation’s detriment, that he’s holding an empty hand. ****** I would bluff at cards but I can’t even count to 52.

        "articles": "Thirty-eight percent of respondents approve of President Donald Trump’s performance. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo white house By QUINT FORGEY 09/10/2019 07:21 AM EDT Updated 09/10/2019 10:44 AM EDT President Donald Trump’s job approval rating fell several points in a new survey, while Americans’ fears of a looming recession have escalated and their confidence in Trump’s handling of the economy has sagged. Thirty-eight percent of respondents in an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday approve of Trump’s performance in office, a drop of 6 percentage points from a peak of 44 percent approval in July. A majority, 56 percent, disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president, while 6 percent have no opinion. Americans’ opinions on Trump’s stewardship of the economy, which his campaign plans to emphasize to voters as he battles for a second term, have also diminished, according to the survey. Less than half of respondents, 46 percent, approve of the way the president is handling the economy, a decrease from 51 percent approval in midsummer. Fewer of those polled, 35 percent, approve of the way the president is handling trade negotiations with China, and 60 percent worry the trade conflict between the two countries will raise the price of goods for their families. Trump has moved to intensify the tariff dispute with Beijing in recent weeks, announcing fresh hikes to duties on Chinese imports. The escalation in the trade war, along with the president’s consistent attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have played out as U.S. financial indicators have warned of a potential economic downturn or recession. More than half of Americans, 60 percent, believe a recession is likely to occur in 2020, according to the survey, and 43 percent said Trump’s trade and economic policies have increased the chance of such a crisis. Only 16 percent of respondents believe Trump’s policies have decreased the odds of a recession, while 34 percent said they have made no difference and 7 percent have no opinion. The majority of respondents still hold a positive view of the state of the economy, 56-43 percent, with 40 percent believing it is in “good” condition and 16 percent describing it as “excellent.” But those numbers represent a decrease from a 65 percent positive assessment last fall. Trump pushed back against the results of the survey Tuesday morning in a perplexing tweet that hit at ABC and the Post, and he claimed his lawyers were able to force changes in past polls. \"ABC/Washington Post Poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 Election,\" he wrote. \"When my lawyers protested, they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by Election Day. It was a Fake Poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets. Sad!\" A few minutes later, he sent another tweet railing against public polling and extolling his campaign's surveys. \"One of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the Fake and Corrupt News Media is the phony Polling Information they put out,\" he wrote. \"Many of these polls are fixed, or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad. Internal polling looks great, the best ever!\" The ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted Sept. 2-5, surveying a random national sample of 1,003 adults in English and Spanish via telephone. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for  Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox. © 2021  LLC",

        "articles": "the friday cover The leaders and reprobates in Congress might get the headlines, but the real story lies in its boring, unimpressive middle. AP Photo/Susan Walsh By JOHN F. HARRIS 04/09/2021 04:30 AM EDT Link Copied John Harris is the founding editor of . Reptilian. Shameless. Greedy. Nauseating. Criminal. These are the types of adjectives that every so often—the interval between episodes never lasts long—are inspired by one story or another about this or that member of Congress. As it happens, we are in one of those seasons again. Perhaps you long ago relinquished your faith that most lawmakers are decent, conscientious, responsible people who are concerned first and above all with legislating in the public interest, and only then turn their attentions to their own earthly appetites. Even so, some of these recent cases are out there: allegations of underage sex trafficking, unwanted public groping, resume-padding, and other manifestations of human weakness and depravity. One useful thing about extreme behavior, however, is that it can help illuminate prevailing norms—the non-extreme, perfectly ordinary reality. So at a time when a lot of recent coverage of lawmakers revolves around allegations, or documented evidence, of unacceptable behavior, it seemed in a peculiar way an apt moment to look at Congress through the prism of a different noun: Mediocrity. As an informal poll, I recently asked a bunch of people I thought would have well-informed views a question: What percentage of members of Congress would you say qualify as impressive? What do you mean by impressive? I let people define it however they wished. Some standard attributes might include people of uncommon intelligence, of either an academic or practical sort. Outsized achievements prior to coming to Congress certainly qualify, as would a clear record of effectiveness within the institution. Some people are impressive by virtue of an especially capacious character. Under any definition, we are talking about people who leave a wake behind them as they navigate life’s personal and professional channels. There was nothing scientific about this poll. It included a dozen or so current or former members of Congress, or longtime operatives, or journalists who have covered Capitol Hill. For what it’s worth, everyone I interviewed met my own definition of impressive. The results were striking. The first-blush answers ranged from a low estimate of one percent (!), to a high estimate of 55 percent (!!) of lawmakers who merit the adjective impressive. On further discussion, though, a fairly solid consensus emerged that about 20 percent of Congress is occupied by people who qualify. “All parts of the Bell Curve of society are well represented.” Which leaves 80 percent who fall a bit short, or a lot short, of the Athenian ideal of the enlightened citizen servant. At the extreme, this group includes Rep. Matt Gaetz, currently under investigation for sex trafficking. But in this crowd you’ll mostly find the uninspiring middle: Perfectly bright and well-intentioned politicians whose efforts are largely ineffectual; people whose competitive streaks earned them a prestigious job but who don’t display great interest in leaving a deep mark on American civic life; people who prove that still waters don’t always run deep; and a few people whose below-the-median traits stimulate genuine wonder: “How is he even here?” AP Photo/Susan Walsh Representative democracy, it turns out, means representation for everyone. That includes whizzes and schlumps and reprobates and the dudes at the seaside Hooters 15 minutes from Gaetz’s Panhandle home of Fort Walton Beach, who might find it OK that their member, according to CNN, showed cell phone photos of nude women he supposedly slept with to other members on the House floor. “All parts of the Bell Curve of society are well represented,” one lawmaker told me, pondering the assortment of many dolts and at least a few deviates who count as colleagues. A senator observed that ambition and discipline count for a lot, but the greatest factor of why one politician makes it to the Senate while others remain on city council is luck: “The bottom 80 percent of this place is no different than the bottom 80 percent of any typical city council.” Here's something to keep in mind whenever you are reading about some politician or legislative battle. Years of covering politics make me think that most people who follow politics from afar have an exaggerated perception of most elected officials. Sometimes this magnification flows from idealism. Civics classes in youth can create a lasting impression that politicians are, or should be, the solons of democratic theory. More often, these days, distorted perceptions flow from cynicism. Even corrupt politicians are supposed to be sinister in an outsized and brilliant way, like Frank Underwood in House of Cards. What both vantage points tend to understate is the pervasive ordinariness of many people who belong to the bottom four quintiles rather than the top one. Journalism and political science, meanwhile, tend to focus on the ways that democracy is being distorted by structural factors. Gerrymandering of congressional seats encourages partisan zealots instead of conscientious servants of the public interest. A media-saturated political culture attracts more narcissists to Washington than ever, helping explain the high number of sex scandals. There is probably something to these theories. But the more salient reality is probably that elected representatives are indeed quite representative of the electorate. In his recent memoir, former congressman John Boehner wrote of the 2010 elections that vaulted him to the speakership: “You could be a total moron and get elected just by having an R next to your name—and that year, by the way, we did pick up a fair number in that category.” But the phenomenon isn’t solely partisan, nor is it related narrowly to intelligence, nor is it necessarily more prevalent now than before. Any legislative body I’ve encountered, at the local, state, or national level, has included many average people who are attracted to politics because it affords an opportunity to puff up their public image, and probably their self-conception, to something above average. And it has included people who—like other sectors of fallen humanity—have abundant exposure to temptations of the flesh, the bottle and the purse. Rep. Tom Reed, a moderate New York Republican, checked two (and arguably all three) of those boxes during a fateful trip to Minneapolis in 2017 that ended his political career prematurely when it was publicized last month by the Washington Post. After the Post article, Reed, 49, publicly apologized to a female lobbyist he was accused of drunkenly assaulting, attributed his boorish behavior to alcoholism for which he says he has sought treatment in recent years, and announced he was not seeking his re-election. What was striking, however, was that Reed himself came to Congress thanks to the sexual indiscretions of his Democratic predecessor in the district, centered in the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes region of western New York. Rep. Eric Massa did not seek re-election after allegations of improper physical contact with men who worked on his staff. The kind of slobbish, cringe-inducing behavior that brought down Reed is actually quite familiar to those who hang around politics. As a young reporter at the Washington Post in the late 1980s, I covered local government in what were then the outer suburbs of Northern Virginia. The chair of the Prince William Board of County supervisors was Kathleen Seefeldt, a teacher with a reserved manner who I regarded as impressive. She would preside with an air of cool austerity while rank buffoonery played out around her. There was the time a discussion of trucking regulations made reference to “common carriers,” which prompted a leering reference to venereal disease among prostitutes in downtown Washington. Everyone but Seefeldt chortled appreciatively. “All parts of the Bell Curve of society are well represented,\" in Congress, one lawmaker said, pondering the assortment of many dolts and at least a few deviates who count as colleagues. | Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images From there my reporting career went in the early 1990s to Richmond, where I covered the Virginia General Assembly for the Post. When the legislature was in session, the nightly scene for many lawmakers revolved around the bar at the Holiday Inn. For many politicians it was clear that one of their motivations for serving in office was to be away from home for a couple months of the year, with drinks and dinners and debauchery that was usually funded by taxpayers, contributors or corporate lobbyists. There was a famous story about a Northern Virginia senator who told his formidable spouse he was at the office working late, then got word that she was coming to get him at the Holiday Inn bar at that very moment. The not-very-formidable senator crawled out a bathroom window with seconds to spare.

The General Assembly was like many legislative bodies—true influence resided in a concentrated group of highly capable people. In the House there was scowling, stoical Speaker A.L. Philpott, a Democratic former segregationist from Southside Virginia whose racial views had evolved out of some combination of conviction and necessity. He knew every sentence of Virginia’s modern criminal code, since he had written or edited the whole thing. Referring to his fellow delegates, he once rasped to another Democrat, “They are sheep!” Over in the Senate, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Hunter B. Andrews reigned with a proudly patrician air. He was one of the few legislators who read every one of the thousand or so bills filed each session. Without solid evidence of bribery, but with reliable intuition, Andrews once told me, “I think a lot of people are on the take.” How else to explain the barrage of narrowly crafted easements and exemptions and subsidies that his fellow politicians were trying to slip into law? I’ve not covered Congress as a beat reporter but I did run a publication (this one) with a primary mission to illuminate the workings of Congress. My strong sense is that the fundamental legislative dynamic of Richmond is no different in Washington: A narrow corps of political practitioners operates in a different orbit of influence than the great sea of average politicians below them. Partisans of one stripe or another may loathe Mitch McConnell, or Nancy Pelosi, but one strains to imagine any serious argument that would say they are not impressive: As politicians, they’ve shown uncanny ability to understand power and how to wield it and both of them have left a meaningful signature on American life—Pelosi by pushing through massive stimulus measures on the narrowest of majorities; McConnell in repopulating the federal judiciary for a generation. They have some impressive colleagues, too. What factors help that narrow slice of politicians rise to that higher orbit? One theme from my survey was that the people who clear the impressive threshold have an ability to think beyond their own district and their own political circumstances. “A lot of these people run for Congress because they like being recognized in their districts and they like knowing they can always have the best table at their favorite restaurant,” said one veteran of Capitol Hill. Even many who take a more serious approach seem often buffeted by the stimuli right before them—town meetings, a barrage of angry letters, local news coverage—without appreciation of wider context. “Did it ever occur to you that what’s true in your district isn’t true in a lot of other districts?” one lawmaker said of colleagues. That understanding of context—of the larger currents of politics and media and how to navigate them—is why a small number of legislators gain outsized influence even without the seniority of a McConnell or Pelosi. “All Congresses and Parliaments have a kindly feeling for idiots, and a compassion for them, on account of personal experience and heredity.” Mark Twain Many progressive Democrats don’t like former Rep. Rahm Emanuel, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But after Emanuel won election to the House in 2002—after serving as a congressional campaign operative and a senior White House adviser for Bill Clinton—he almost instantly became a player on Capitol Hill. He was in the Democratic leadership by his second term, and soon became chief of staff in Barack Obama’s White House and then mayor of Chicago. As it happens, another example is none other than AOC, whose self-confidence and savvy—who could dispute that her skills are impressive?—made her a national figure to contend with in her first days in Congress. The rareness of these examples highlights the larger landscape. Plenty of perfectly decent but basically conventional politicians are not likely to ever rise above average. And plenty of other politicians with the kind of weaknesses that are common in any workplace aren’t likely to rise above below average. This reality, a faithful expression of democracy, has been around forever. “All Congresses and Parliaments have a kindly feeling for idiots,” said Mark Twain “and a compassion for them, on account of personal experience and heredity.” He was joking, or mostly so, one of many rude comments he made about the legislative branch. But recall a comment that was evidently not made in jest. A half-century ago, Richard Nixon nominated for the Supreme Court a man named G. Harrold Carswell of Florida. The nomination failed, but along the way liberal Sen. George McGovern protested, “I find his record to be distinguished largely by two qualities: racism and mediocrity.” This prompted Sen. Roman Hruska, a Nebraska Republican, to come to Carswell’s defense with a quote for the ages. He noted that there are lots of mediocre people—many contemporary observers counted Hruska among their ranks—and that shouldn’t be held against them. “They are entitled to a little representation, aren't they, and a little chance?” Hruska asked. They had plenty of representation then, and still do today. Link Copied © 2021  LLC",

By JOSH GERSTEIN, MATTHEW NUSSBAUM, DARREN SAMUELSOHN and JOSH DAWSEY 05/17/2017 06:00 PM EDT Updated 05/17/2017 08:32 PM EDT Former FBI Director Robert Mueller has been named to oversee the probe. | AP Photo The Justice Department on Wednesday named former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as special counsel investigating Russia's alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election, including any possible involvement of President Donald Trump's campaign in that effort. Meeting the increasingly vocal demands of Democratic lawmakers, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein tapped Mueller to oversee the probe, despite recent White House statements that they viewed the appointment of a special counsel as unnecessary. \"Based upon the unique circumstances, the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command,\" Rosenstein said in a statement. \"A special counsel is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome. Our nation is grounded on the rule of law, and the Public must be assured that government officials administer the law fairly.\" As special counsel, Mueller will have broad investigatory powers to look into how Russia may have influenced the 2016 election. The investigation, which could take months and will follow a separate track from congressional inquiries, likely will involve accessing classified documents and interviews, and Mueller can also convene grand juries and seek indictments if he deems it appropriate. He will have access to all the information the FBI and Justice Department have compiled so far. Trump said in a statement after the announcement that he expected the probe would find no collusion between his campaign and foreign countries. \"As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know — there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,\" Trump said. \"I look forward to this matter concluding quickly.\" By AUSTIN WRIGHT Rosenstein did not say what spurred the decision, but it came one day after press reports emerged that former FBI Director James Comey kept notes about his interactions with Trump on the Russia probe, including one reflecting a request from the president to abandon any investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who played a key role on Trump's campaign. The revelations led to increased Democratic calls for a special prosecutor, and even some Republicans voiced support. Compounding the White House’s woes, news leaked that Trump provided two Russian officials with classified information during an Oval Office meeting last week. The White House was not told of Rosenstein’s decision to name Mueller until after the order had been signed, the Justice Department said. Lawmakers were briefed on the appointment Wednesday afternoon, according to a source familiar with the matter. Trump, who fired Comey last week, was in the middle of interviewing candidates to replace him as FBI director when he was informed, according to a person close to the White House. White House officials were blindsided by the move, an administration official said. A large group of staffers went to the Oval Office to inform Trump, according to a person in the room, who said Trump took the news better than expected and signed off on the statement his aides crafted. Trump has called the Russia inquiry a “taxpayer-funded charade” and said accusations of collusion are “fake news” and a “hoax” pushed by Democrats as an excuse for losing the election. The White House has repeatedly insisted that there was no wrongdoing by Trump or the campaign.

The Justice Department statement Wednesday shed little light on the ongoing probe, which Comey had confirmed existed during testimony to Congress in March. However, the order Rosenstein signed appointing Mueller made clear his authority includes scrutinizing actions taken by people affiliated with the Trump campaign. The deputy attorney general, who was the one to name Mueller because Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from Russia issues, stressed that the move to appoint a special prosecutor did not mean anyone involved acted illegally. \"My decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted,\" Rosenstein said in his statement. Mueller agreed to resign from his private law firm, WilmerHale, to pursue the probe, the Justice Department said. The appointment immediately received plaudits. “I can’t think of a better selection,” said John Carlin, who led the Justice Department’s national security division as it pursued the Russia hacking investigation in its earliest stages before the November election. Carlin, a former FBI chief of staff and senior counsel to Mueller, insisted his former boss would run a by-the-book operation. “He’s the world’s most buttoned-down person that has conducted himself in each spot that he’s had,” Carlin said. \"What he’s going to do is follow the facts and evidence where they lead. There will either be charges that can be brought or there won’t. There won’t be additional discussion.” The move also met bipartisan approval — or at least acceptance — on Capitol Hill, where even Republicans who had resisted the call for a special prosecutor lauded Mueller. “The deputy attorney general decided we ought to have a special counsel or whatever you want to call it,” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), whose powerful panel oversees the Justice Department. “He’s got the power to do it, and you have to accept it, and it doesn’t matter what we think.” “A special counsel is very much needed in this situation, and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein has done the right thing,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. “Former Director Mueller is exactly the right kind of individual for this job. I now have significantly greater confidence that the investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead.” Rosenstein, who was already scheduled to brief senators Thursday, had come under fire from Democrats for drafting the memo that was initially said to be the precipitating factor for Comey’s firing, though Trump later said he would have fired Comey either way.

While the appointment is a setback for Trump’s floundering policy agenda, it is less clear what it means for him personally. White House press secretary Sean Spicer earlier Wednesday sidestepped a question about whether Trump was considering a personal lawyer to represent him on the investigation. “If I have any updates for that at some point, I’ll let you know,” he told reporters on Air Force One. Asked whether he was representing Trump in a personal capacity on the Russia investigation, the president’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen replied in a phone interview, “I don’t know if he’s made a complete decision. There’s several mitigating factors.” Cohen declined further comment. A representative from Morgan, Lewis & Bockius — the firm that has long worked for Trump on tax issues and also played a key role in his moves to untangle his business interests — declined immediate comment when asked whether it was representing the president in a personal capacity. The appointment of Mueller marked the first time the Justice Department has gone outside its ranks to tap a special prosecutor since 1999, when Attorney General Janet Reno picked former Sen. John Danforth to investigate the showdown at the Branch Davidian complex in Waco, Texas. Subsequent attorneys general have also named special prosecutors, but from within the department under other rules. The best-known such appointment in recent years came in 2003 when Comey — then the deputy attorney general — named Patrick Fitzgerald, then U.S. attorney in Chicago, to oversee an investigation into the leak of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame. Fitzgerald never charged anyone with the leak, but he obtained an indictment of Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, Lewis Libby, for lying to investigators and obstructing justice in the probe. A jury convicted Libby, who was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. President George W. Bush commuted that sentence but declined to wipe out Libby’s conviction. In previous decades, special prosecutors were usually appointed under a statute commonly referred to as the independent counsel law. That measure — formally part of the Ethics in Government Act — expired in 1999 amid considerable controversy over the spending and conduct of a slew of independent counsels during the 1980s and 1990s. They included Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr, whose investigation morphed repeatedly, eventually resulting in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.

By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI 02/19/2017 08:18 AM EST Updated 02/19/2017 12:09 PM EST Democratic Party leaders are trying to rein in the talk of impeachment for President Donald Trump that’s animating the grassroots. | Getty They call it the ‘I’ word. Just a month into Donald Trump’s presidency, Democratic Party leaders are trying to rein in the talk of impeachment that’s animating the grass roots, the product of a restive base demanding deeper and more aggressive investigations into Trump’s ties to Russia. Democratic officials in Republican-dominated Washington view the entire subject as a trap, a premature discussion that could backfire in spectacular fashion by making the party appear too overzealous in its opposition to Trump. Worse, they fear, it could harden Republican support for the president by handing his party significant fundraising and political ammunition when the chances of success for an early impeachment push are remote, at best. “We need to assemble all of the facts, and right now there are a lot of questions about the president’s personal, financial and political ties with the Russian government before the election, but also whether there were any assurances made,” said California Rep. Eric Swalwell, a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. “Before you can use the ‘I’ word, you really need to collect all the facts.\" “The ‘I’ word we should be focused on,” added Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, “is 'investigations.'\" The problem for party lawmakers is that the hard-to-placate Democratic base has assumed a stop-Trump-at-all-costs posture. At a recent town hall in Albany, Oregon, Sen. Ron Wyden faced three questions about the issue. Rep. Jim McGovern, who was also confronted with the impeachment question at an event in Northampton, Mass., told his constituents it's not the right strategy for the moment, according to local reports. In California, a real estate broker has launched a challenge to Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher using a new “Impeach Trump Leadership PAC.” White House By DARREN SAMUELSOHN and ANNIE KARNI But it’s not just furious rank-and-file Democrats who are raising the idea. A handful of Democratic House progressives — among them California Rep. Maxine Waters, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin and Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro — have already publicly raised the specter of impeachment. Waters has said she thinks Trump is marching himself down the path to impeachment, while Raskin — whose office was presented last week with a petition carrying more than 850,000 signatures calling for impeachment — has repeatedly brought up the prospect of voting for impeachment \"at some point\" in rallies and interviews. Castro has said Trump should be impeached if the president repeatedly instructs Customs and Border Protection officials to ignore federal judges' orders. Some have read New York Rep. Jerry Nadler’s “resolution of inquiry” that could force the Department of Justice to share information about Trump’s Russian ties and conflicts of interest as a way to further lay the groundwork for impeachment. “You see immense energy from people who want to resist the president. And that’s affecting the Congress,” said California Rep. Ted Lieu, who has said that a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives would impeach Trump. \"A recent poll came out saying that 46 percent of Americans want the president impeached, and certainly members of Congress take notice.\" Still, most congressional Democrats insist on drawing a line that stops far short of using the loaded term. Responding to Waters' impeachment chatter this month, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said, \"When and if he breaks the law, that is when something like that would come up. But that's not the subject of today.\" They believe that even if they did have enough evidence to start impeachment proceedings — which they don’t, since a number of investigations are still in their early stages, and Democrats can’t just impeach a president because they don’t like him — they wouldn’t have anywhere near enough votes as long as Trump-sympathetic Republicans control the majority. Neither party leadership nor the campaign committees have circulated talking points or suggested ways to respond to impeachment questions that are starting to appear. But they are already aware of the potential electoral blowback to the party. White House By JOSH DAWSEY The mere mention of impeachment on the left has already kicked off a fundraising frenzy on the Republican side, with both the GOP House and Senate campaign wings raising cash off it — much like Democrats did under President Barack Obama when Republicans speculated about the prospect. “No president has EVER endured the level of disrespect shown to President Trump. (It’s sickening) Unprecedented obstruction from the left on his cabinet nominees. Mockery and scorn from the liberal media. And now the liberal elite are calling for his impeachment … IN HIS FIRST MONTH,” reads a National Republican Senatorial Committee email from last week. Since 12 House Democrats sit in seats won by Trump while 23 House Republicans serve districts won by Hillary Clinton, party operatives eyeing gains in the chamber fear that crossover voters could turn against Democrats if their party is perceived as reckless in its pursuit of Trump. Nonetheless, the pressure to stand in Trump’s way has amped up on the ground in the days since the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, say party officials, and Democratic voters appear poised to pounce on any further revelations. “The energy right now is really on Congress and trying to get some Republicans to find some backbone. As we see the Flynn stuff and the question of who asked him to make the call, that could change as it develops,” said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper, who’s been touring his state in a series of town hall meetings. “But for the moment people are focused on the most productive avenues for their frustrations, like ‘Call Pat Tiberi’ or 'Tell Rob Portman to vote against Scott Pruitt.’\" WASHINGTON AND THE WORLD By TAYLOR GEE Rather than pursuing impeachment, most Hill Democrats are focusing their energies on persuading colleagues across the aisle to publicly support or join their investigations, viewing that as the most productive path forward. The brewing voter anger can only help them reach that goal, they believe. “Both Democrats and Republicans are going home for the next 10 days for our district work period, and I suspect Republicans are going to hear a lot from home, from their constituents,” said Swalwell. “Before Flynn resigned, as this was boiling up over the weekend, Republicans I would run into in town would start to say, ‘What is going on?’ Even those who were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.\" Senate Democratic leadership is for now content with the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee taking the lead, while others have called for an independent, 9/11-style commission looking into Trump’s Russian ties. Urging the creation of such a group, the Democratic National Committee proclaimed that the scandal was already “bigger than Watergate.\" Those ever-more-popular comparisons to Richard Nixon, accordingly, are as close to impeachment talk as most Democrats will get. “There are eerie parallels,” said Boyle, \"between the 1972 campaign going into ’73 and the beginning of the Watergate hearings, and the experience of 2016 going into 2017.\" Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "AP Photo Three key Democrats said they would back the agreement this morning. By BURGESS EVERETT and SEUNG MIN KIM 09/08/2015 11:23 AM EDT Updated 09/08/2015 06:15 PM EDT President Barack Obama won decisively on the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday. But the Senate’s war over the agreement is just beginning. While the accord will survive Republican attempts to derail it, the Senate still faces a bitter fight over how exactly Democrats will stymie the GOP. Right now, it’s not clear if Democrats will block a Republican disapproval resolution with a filibuster on the floor, or if President Barack Obama will have to veto the measure, a move that almost surely would have to be upheld by another vote in Congress. Democrats argue that a presidential veto, and the weeks of additional debate the override process would eat up, could hurt the United States’ international standing. But Republicans are eager to put political pressure on Democrats and keep the focus on an agreement the GOP argues is a threat to Israel’s existence and weakens U.S. security. Despite those concerns, and a fierce, multi-million dollar lobbying campaign against the deal from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and others, Obama hit the magic number of 41 senators on Tuesday, denying Republicans a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. But rather than take a victory lap, Democratic leaders that support the deal are still working their members in preparation for a decisive Wednesday party lunch that will determine whether the Senate minority is prepared to mount a historic filibuster of the resolution. “They don’t like the notion ‘filibuster.’ They had a bellyful of filibusters when Republicans were in the minority,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) of the colleagues he is canvassing. “Now we’re getting into the type of vote it is … nobody knows the answer to the question.” Indeed, pro-deal Democratic sources hope the 41 members who support the underlying deal will stick together behind a filibuster, but there are no guarantees. And Republicans in both chambers are discussing the possibility of voting on Friday, Sept. 11, to put maximum political pressure on Democrats, according to senior GOP sources. In a brief interview, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) was noncommittal on the filibuster question and said he will \"wait and see\" to hear what the full caucus says during their first post-recess meeting on Wednesday. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said it could be confusing to vote one way on a procedural vote and another way on the final disapproval question. “I may still vote against cloture because I’ve taken a position on the merits and that I’m just afraid it sends a different message if I vote a different way on cloture,” Blumenthal said in a telephone interview Tuesday. What Democrats really want is to set up a vote that blocks out the parliamentary noise and boils the Iran debate down to a single, easily understood roll call vote. Even those Democrats that oppose the Iran agreement say they support one vote on a disapproval resolution set at a 60 vote threshold, the typical bar for most Senate business. “I’m for an up or down vote,” said Senate Foreign Relations ranking member Ben Cardin (D-Md.), one of four Democrats to oppose the deal. “It should be a 60-vote threshold. That’s what we all thought it was going to be.” But Democrats aren’t going to get what they want. If they want to block the Iran resolution, it will be on the GOP’s terms. After repeatedly noting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s history of leading filibusters for eight years in the minority, Sen. Harr Reid (D-Nev.), the Democratic leaders, asked on Tuesday afternoon for an agreement to vote on the resolution at a 60-vote threshold later this week. McConnell (R-Ky.) flatly rejected the offer, instead proposing an “up-or-down” vote with a 50-vote threshold, while portraying a potential Democratic filibuster as obstruction and “obfuscation to shield the president” if Democrats use the chamber’s supermajority requirement to reject the resolution. The two leaders battled to a stalemate on Tuesday, making it likely McConnell will set up a vote to break a filibuster for later this week. If McConnell moves to do so on Wednesday, the Senate would vote on Friday Sept. 11 on whether the resolution should be taken up by the Senate for a simple majority passage vote. At that point, it would pass the chamber and head to the president’s desk for a veto. In preparation for the potential intersection of the anniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks and a historic foreign policy vote, Republicans are sharpening their rhetorical barbs. “Even the Ayatollah Khamenei said the Iranian parliament gets a vote on the nuke deal. It would be beyond irresponsible for Senate Democrats to block, by a filibuster, the vote,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, (R-Texas) said in an interview on Tuesday. But Cornyn also said that without an agreement between McConnell and Reid the Senate will likely vote next week. Democrats say there’s a decent chance they would win that filibuster vote, but some Democrats are wary of blocking the resolution for fear of the political optics. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced his opposition to the overall accord after souring on the possibility he'd be asked to filibuster a resolution of disapproval, even after signaling that he was preparing to back the deal. In a Washington speech on Tuesday morning, Reid confidently declared that Obama's \"agreement will stand.” But he was coy about whether he can hold his caucus together and block a resolution of disapproval from even reaching the president's desk. \"I don't have gut feelings. We'll have to wait and see how others will vote,\" Reid said as he left the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he made a lengthy defense of the international deal that would lift some sanctions on Iran while scaling back their nuclear ambitions. Other Democrats supporting the deal, like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) held events on Tuesday to herald the deal now that Democrats can clearly muster enough votes to sustain a veto of a resolution of disapproval. Indeed, for backers of the deal there was much to celebrate as support materialized from Sens. Gary Peters of Michigan, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. And Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) added her support on Tuesday evening, saying \"I'll support it in any way I can.\" That backing brings support in the Senate for Obama's agreement to 42 Democrats, enough to deny the GOP a filibuster-proof majority of 60 votes. Notably, that apparently coordinated show of support emerged following Manchin's decision to vote against the resolution. The last Republican hold-out, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, formally sealed the Iran agreement’s partisan fate on Tuesday, announcing her opposition to the deal on Tuesday afternoon and ensuring that at least 58 senators will oppose the deal.

        "articles": "The effort is likely to prompt more debate among Democrats as to whether they should fight to restore norms and civility, or engage in tougher, brass-knuckle politics. | Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images 2020 Elections By ALEX THOMPSON 02/25/2019 09:11 AM EST Updated 02/27/2019 12:03 AM EST Progressive activists are pushing 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to commit to increasing the number of Supreme Court justices in order to dilute the current conservative majority. The recently created, aptly named “Pack the Courts” told  it has raised more than $500,000 to jump-start its effort and has partnered with Demand Justice, a progressive group founded in 2018 that is trying to match Republicans' organizing efforts around the judiciary. \"At Demand Justice, we strongly believe that reforming the court — especially by expanding it — is the cornerstone for re-building American democracy,” said Brian Fallon, director of Demand Justice and a former Hillary Clinton press secretary. “The Kavanaugh court is a partisan operation, and democracy simply cannot function when stolen courts operate as political shills. We are thrilled to work in coalition with the team at Pack the Courts to undo the politicization of the judiciary.” The effort is likely to prompt more debate among Democrats as to whether they should fight to restore norms and civility that have dissipated in the Trump era or engage in tougher, brass-knuckle politics. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stirred up such a debate last week when she expressed openness to eliminating the Senate's legislative filibuster in order to pass a robust liberal agenda. Fellow presidential candidates Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) have said they are wary of altering the filibuster rules, which would change the threshold to pass most legislation from 60 votes to 51. history dept. By JUDGE GLOCK Pack the Courts Executive Director Aaron Belkin, a political science professor at San Francisco State University, said he thinks norms are important but “in this moment, only one side is honoring norms meaning they aren’t really norms anymore.” He said adding justices to the Supreme Court, which has had nine members since 1869, could “restore democracy to our democracy” with decisions on issues like voting rights and gerrymandering. The group’s strategy centers on influencing the left’s political debate with a combination of producing social media videos, enlisting online influencers, conducting polling on individual court cases and partnering with academics on research. Belkin said his group has retained Means of Production, a liberal digital marketing firm that has become famous for its viral Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez web ad, to produce its online content. CNN’s W. Kamau Bell has joined the group’s advisory board to spread its message. Without the millions of dollars that some progressive groups have saved, the lean operation will be active online and attempt to set up a field operation to pressure lawmakers — tactics that progressive groups like Indivisible and the Sunrise Movement have used to significant effect. Sean McElwee, Pack the Courts’ director of research and polling, succeeded last year in pushing #AbolishIce into the Democratic Party mainstream and hopes court packing will be next by focusing on the 2020 presidential candidates. “Progressives strongly disapprove of numerous Supreme Court decisions and increasingly see the court as a partisan institution, and that provides a strong incentive for presidential candidates to endorse court packing,” McElwee said. And at least one presidential candidate appears open to the idea. “I don’t think we should be laughing at it,” South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said at an event in Philadelphia last week. “Because in some ways, it’s no more a shattering of norms than what’s already been done to get the judiciary to where it is today.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "He says the GOP has been using talk of scandals to deflect from the improving economy. By JONATHAN TOPAZ 07/23/2014 09:20 AM EDT Updated 07/24/2014 09:44 AM EDT Democratic Rep. Jim Himes on Wednesday offered some advice to a particularly angry conservative caller: Try a little less Fox News. On C-SPAN’s Washington Journal, a caller from Michigan asked for the Connecticut congressman to try to defend a laundry list of grievances he had with President Barack Obama, including the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and the IRS scandal. Himes smiled during much of the statement, during which the caller rattled off a number of complaints, including the claim that the White House and not Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was responsible for the October 2013 government shutdown. He also referenced older issues like his comments about the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates and the Justice Department’s Fast and Furious program. “Any other president would have been laughed out of office by now if he’d have been a Republican,” the caller concluded. “This guy gets away with murder!” “That was quite a list,” Himes said with a laugh. The congressman initially appeared willing to address all the issues, but then decided against it, saying that it would take hours to address the numerous complaints leveled at the administration. “I will try to attend to — actually, I’m not going to,” he said. “Look, with all due respect, Bob, maybe a little more C-SPAN and a little less Fox News. That was the grab bag of everything that Fox News and my friends on the Republican Caucus of the House in particular have tried to hang on the president.” Himes then picked one of the issues — the attacks in Benghazi — and defended the White House against what he called conspiracy theories from conservatives. “There’s been absolutely zero evidence that the president had any hand in any one of these so-called scandals that the Republicans have desperately been trying to promote,” he continued, saying that the GOP was trying to deflect from the improving economy under the president. While Himes conceded that Obama has made “mistakes,” he called the notion that the White House had its hand in several scandals “a figment of Fox News’ imagination.” Himes is in his third term representing Connecticut’s 4th District.

By JAKE SHERMAN and ALEX ISENSTADT 05/10/2018 05:48 AM EDT Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has cut a $30 million check to the House GOP-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund, a massive cash infusion that top Republicans hope will alter the party's electoral outlook six months before Election Day. The long-sought donation was sealed last week when, according to two senior Republicans, House Speaker Paul Ryan flew to Las Vegas to meet with the billionaire at his Venetian Hotel. Also at the meeting with Adelson was his wife, Miriam; Norm Coleman, the former Minnesota senator who chairs the Republican Jewish Coalition; Corry Bliss, who oversees the super PAC; and Jake Kastan, Ryan's No. 2 political aide. They laid out a case to Adelson about how crucial it is to protect the House. As a federally elected official, Ryan is not permitted to solicit seven-figure political donations. When Ryan (R-Wis.) left the room, Coleman made the ask and secured the $30 million contribution. CLF did not respond to requests for comment. The contribution will become public later this month in the organization's campaign finance filing. Coleman said he would not discuss his dealings with Adelson. Adelson’s donation comes at a perilous moment for House Republicans, who are facing growing headwinds as they try to save their majority. With dozens of incumbents being outraised by emboldened Democratic challengers, desperate party officials have been hoping that Adelson — the party’s most prominent benefactor — would give more than he traditionally does, and earlier in the election cycle.

Adelson came through by giving now, as opposed to waiting until late summer or the fall. The $30 million contribution is three times as much as Adelson gave to CLF in 2016. And the cash comes much earlier in the cycle: In 2016, Adelson gave CLF $10 million in August, as the campaign headed into the homestretch. Party officials have been paying Adelson their respects. In February, a number of House Republicans made their annual sojourn to Las Vegas to attend the annual retreat hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition, an organization that Adelson helps to fund. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) addressed the conference, and Ryan spoke by teleconference to a meeting of the group’s board. CLF is one part of a two-pronged political organization designed to protect and bolster House Republicans. CLF is a super PAC, and the American Action Network is a nonprofit that boosts center-right policies. Ryan, and John Boehner before him, have backed the groups. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE 01/23/2018 02:47 PM EST Updated 01/23/2018 03:33 PM EST Joe Biden said Tuesday that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stopped the Obama administration from speaking out about Russian interference in the 2016 campaign by refusing to sign on to a bipartisan statement of condemnation. That moment, the former Democratic vice president said, made him think “the die had been cast ... this was all about the political play.” He expressed regret, in hindsight, given the intelligence he says came in after Election Day. \"Had we known what we knew three weeks later, we may have done something more,” Biden, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, said. Biden was speaking at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations, a block from his old office at the Old Executive Office Building, to discuss his new article in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs, “How to Stand Up to the Kremlin.” Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or updates from  and you agree to our privacy policy and terms of service.

Biden said he and former President Barack Obama worried that without a united front of bipartisanship, speaking out before the election would undermine the legitimacy of the election and American institutions in a way that would play into the Russians’ larger ambitions. “Can you imagine if the president called a press conference in October, with this fella, Bannon, and company, and said, ‘Tell you what: Russians are trying to interfere in our elections and we have to do something about it,’” Biden said. “What do you think would have happened? Would things have gotten better, or would it further look like we were trying to delegitimize the electoral process, because of our opponent?” McConnell’s office disputed this account, pointing to a letter signed by all four congressional leaders in September 2016 and sent to the president of the National Association of State Election Directors, urging cybersecurity precautions in light of reports of attempted hacking. That missive, however, did not address Russia specifically, or the larger topic of influence beyond voting systems. “The Obama administration requested that the Congressional leaders send this letter and they all did. It’s publicly available on the Internet for all to see,” said Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell. But a former Obama White House official on Tuesday afternoon echoed Biden's frustration with the Senate majority leader, pointing to the way Obama's White House chief of staff Denis McDonough described the dispute in an op-ed last summer. “Our administration's interest in making sure the response was bipartisan wasn't for the sake of being bipartisan. It was necessary because we needed the buy-in from state and local election administrators (many of whom were Republican partisans and/or skeptical of federal government),” the official argued in an email. “Unfortunately, as is well documented, Senator McConnell was unwilling to help — only making matters worse.” Biden told Tuesday's gathering that there was a “constant tightrope,” with the Obama administration unable to decide what would count as saying too little or too much. “The president and I would sit there literally after the [presidential daily briefing], after everyone had left the room, and say, ‘What the hell are we going to do?’” Biden recalled. The Trump administration, Biden said, isn’t doing much to counter Russian interference in elections and other disruptive activity around the world. He accused the current administration of \"abdicating\" its responsibility in that regard and squandering its power as a result. By LOUIS NELSON Biden told Council on Foreign Relations president Richard Haass that he wouldn’t call the current conflict with Russia a second Cold War, because it’s not a great ideological battle. Rather, Biden said, it's “just basically about a kleptocracy protecting itself.” Figuring out how to make that case, he added, had led to an internal debate within the Obama administration about whether to make public their estimate of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s self-worth, which Biden suggested would make clear he’d benefited massively from corruption. He said he’d been pushing to do so. Confused and frustrated foreign leaders around the world have continued to turn to him over the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency, Biden said, and he continues to take the calls. “The questions across the board range from, ‘What the hell’s going on, Joe?’” he said, “to ‘What advice do you have for me?’” Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "The author writes that JPMorgan's revelations demonstrated the need for robust rules. | REUTERS By MICHAEL S. BARR 05/24/2012 09:28 PM EDT When financial giant JPMorgan Chase recently revealed that it had lost far more than $2 billion in a credit derivatives trade gone wrong, the news sent a clear message: Opponents of financial reform are wrong. Without the Dodd-Frank Act and the global reforms being led by the United States, the financial sector would go back to its old ways, eventually putting taxpayers and the economy at grave risk of harm. Yet for the presumed GOP nominee Mitt Romney, the news sent a very different message. He repeated his call to repeal Dodd-Frank, though it made the system stronger, and though JPMorgan’s revelations demonstrated the need for robust rules. Romney and many Republican lawmakers seem intent on going back to the financial casino that led to the worst economic crisis in 80 years. The financial industry has spent far more than $100 million trying to roll back Wall Street reform. Romney, meanwhile, has been clear about what he wanted to get rid of — a comprehensive financial reform package that passed Congress and was signed by the president. Yet he makes only the vaguest of promises about what he might do instead. Romney’s reaction is the equivalent of putting out a small fire in your house, then deciding that the lesson is you need to stuff your house with matches, throw out your fire extinguisher and cancel your fire insurance. And doing all this after the house nearly burned to the ground less than four years ago. The system of rules under which the financial industry operated in the lead-up to the financial crisis was broken. Financial institutions took on too much risk with too little capital. Financial companies could escape meaningful supervision by calling themselves investment banks or insurance conglomerates rather than commercial banks, and all institutions could move assets and liabilities off the balance sheet and out of regulatory purview in the shadow banking system. Derivatives were traded in the dark; conflicts of interest were rife; securitizations and synthetic products hid real risks; and there was no way to wind down a major firm like Lehman Brothers without causing widespread harm. Consumers and investors lacked adequate protections, which too often meant that the financial industry could take advantage of them. These flaws blew up the financial system, crushed the economy and cost millions of Americans their jobs. They wiped out families’ savings and put homes at risk. These flaws lined the pockets of Wall Street bankers while making taxpayers the fall guy for their failures. This is what we would get back if we followed Romney’s advice and repealed Dodd-Frank. The Dodd-Frank Act, once fully implemented, can change all that. It has already increased capital requirements and created the authority to regulate Wall Street firms that pose a threat to financial stability, without regard to their corporate form. It enacted a resolution authority to wind down these major firms in the event of a crisis — without feeding a panic or putting taxpayers on the hook, putting an end to Too Big to Fail; restricted risky activities by firms with taxpayer-insured deposits, including through the “Volcker rule”; imposed a cap on the relative size of the largest firms; and required transparency, central clearing, exchange trading and margin for the derivatives market. It established a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to look out for the interests of American households. Key provisions of reform are already working. For example, measures requiring large banks to hold more capital have helped make financial institutions more resilient. And if a big firm got itself into deep trouble today, the government now has the tools to wind it down, with shareholders and creditors taking their losses. Rules under other parts of the Dodd-Frank Act are still being drafted by regulators and must be completed to protect taxpayers and the economy. We need a strong Volcker rule to prevent banks from making risky bets with taxpayer-insured deposits and strict limits on counter-party exposures among the largest financial firms to limit systemic risk. We need robust rules for derivatives clearing and trading, and adequate funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce them. We need strong consumer and investor protections to keep the market fair and open. Yet Romney and many Republicans in Congress are determined to forget the lessons of the crisis by repealing rules that could address the weaknesses in our regulatory system that allowed the financial crisis to happen. Romney suggested last week that he wasn’t even concerned by the JPMorgan losses. But for those of us who remember how Wall Street reacted after the 2008 financial collapse, the losses reminded us why regulators need to finish the job of implementing these and other key provisions as quickly and robustly as possible; w hy Congress should stop trying to cut necessary budgets and block agency nominees; and why Romney should take a cold hard look at the ways in which his support for Wall Street’s lobbying exposes taxpayers and the economy to enormous risk of another crisis.

        "articles": "By NICK GASS 06/02/2015 07:11 AM EDT Updated 06/02/2015 09:39 AM EDT Hillary Clinton is seeing her highest unfavorability ratings in 14 years, according to the latest CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday. Just 46 percent said they view the Democratic presidential front-runner favorably, compared to 50 percent who said they have an unfavorable view. In the preceding April survey, Clinton polled with 53 percent favorable, compared to 44 percent unfavorable. Despite holding a commanding lead among declared and potential Democratic opponents, the public has not viewed Clinton this unfavorably since March 2001, when the former first lady was in her third month as a New York senator. Just 44 percent said they had a favorable view of Clinton at that time, with 53 percent seeing her in an unfavorable light. Clinton grabbed 60 percent of the primary field among Democrats and independent-leaning Democrats, with Vice President Joe Biden, who has not declared an intention to run, a distant second with 14 percent and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 10 percent. Sanders officially launched his campaign as a Democrat late last month. Voters are also skeptical about Clinton in other ways — they are split on whether she “inspires confidence” (49 percent say that applies to her, 50 percent do not) and on whether she “cares about people like you” (47 percent say it applies, 52 percent it does not apply). Consistent with other polls on the issue, just 42 percent say they think the former secretary of state is “honest and trustworthy,” compared with 57 percent who say they do not. At the same time, 61 percent responded that emails being released by the State Department from her time at Foggy Bottom will not show that she did anything wrong in that capacity. The CNN poll was conducted May 29-31 among 1,025 Americans via land lines and cellphones, carrying an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Among Democrats and leaners, the sampling error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. A separate poll released Tuesday by The Washington Post and ABC News found that Clinton’s favorability was 45 percent, the lowest in that survey since April 2008, when she was in the midst of a tough primary fight with Barack Obama.

        "articles": "Getty Images The Friday Cover Trump says heâs a master negotiator. Those whoâve actually dealt with him beg to differ. By MICHAEL KRUSE June 01, 2018 Michael Kruse is a senior staff writer for . In 1985, Tony Schwartz, a writer for New York magazine, was sitting in Donald Trumpâs office in Trump Tower interviewing him for a story. Trump told him he had agreed to write a book for Random House. âWell, if youâre going to write a book,â Schwartz said, recalling this interaction in a speech he gave last fall at the University of Michigan, âyou ought to call it The Art of the Deal.â âI like that,â Trump said. âDo you want to write it?â These sorts of arrangements typically are not that generous for the writer. âMost writers for hire receive a flat fee, or a relatively modest percentage of any money the book earns,â Schwartz said in the speech. Schwartz, by contrast, got from Trump an almost unheard-of half of the $500,000 advance from Random House and also half of the royalties. And it didnât even take a lot of haggling. âHe basically just agreed,â Schwartz told me in an email, meaning Schwartz ever since has brought in millions of dollars more of royalties and Trump has brought in millions of dollars less. Itâs a telling example, Harvard Business School negotiating professor Deepak Malhotra said in a recent interview. âWhat should have been a great deal on a book about negotiation actually is one of the most interesting pieces of evidence that heâs not a good negotiator.â Malhotra, the author of Negotiating the Impossible, pointed out Schwartz even got his name on the cover, and in same-sized text. âI donât think thereâs a better ghostwriting deal out there.â The book, of course, became far more than a surprising and lasting commercial successâit also was central to Trumpâs appeal as a presidential candidate. âWe need a leader that wrote The Art of the Deal,â he said in the speech in which he announced his candidacy in 2015. âIâm a negotiator. Iâve done very well over the years through negotiation,â he said in a Republican debate in 2016. âThatâs what I do, is deals,â he said last month. âI know deals, I think, better than anybody knows deals,â he added.

But these past 16 months of Trumpâs presidency have shown that whatever skills Trump thinks he acquired over the course of his business career havenât necessarily translated to his work in the White House. The failed repeal-and-replace health care negotiations, bungled efforts to get funding from Mexico for his promised border wall, the pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Iran nuclear dealâTrump has proven to be more adept at breaking deals than making deals. And the sudden and bizarre scuttling of his meeting with murderous North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un that had been scheduled for June 12 in Singaporeâand now might be back on againâis only the latest data point that suggests heâs either not as good at negotiating as he promised he was, or that negotiating with disparate factions of Congress or in geopolitically fraught international arenas is harder than he thought it would be and harder than anything heâs ever done. The truth, according to negotiation experts who have studied Trumpâs track record, people who have negotiated for him and against him, associates, biographers and former employees, is that itâs all of that. Trump was, and still is, they say, a confident, competitive, aggressive, impulsive, zero-sum, win-at-all-costs, transactional, unpredictable, often underinformed and ill-prepared, gut-following, ego-driven, want-it-and-want-it-now negotiator. His self-burnished image as a tip-top deal-maker long has obscured an actual record that is far more mixed, pocked with moves and acquisitions that scratched a passing itch but created massive financial problems later. His best work, too, was his earliest work. Trump was at his most patient, his most diligent, his most attentive and his most creativeâhis most effectiveâsome 35 to 45 years ago, when he was intent on pile-driving into the cultural bedrock powerful storylines on which he would build his career as a celebrity business tycoon. Donald Trump rubs an oversized âmagic lampâ during the opening ceremony for his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, April 5, 1990. | AFP/Getty Images At no point, though, in the past nearly half a centuryâfrom the shrewd, well-timed talks that led to the Grand Hyatt and Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan to the agreements behind The Art of the Deal and âThe Apprenticeââdid Trumpâs negotiations in real estate and entertainment circles prepare him fully for the degree of nuance and complexity he now faces as president. And his abrupt cancellation last week of the North Korea summit, in the estimation of the negotiating experts I talked to, was a scramble to reclaim a modicum of the leverage he gave up when he too eagerly consented to the meeting in the first place. But Trumpâs decision to leave open the possibility of rescheduling (ââ¦ please do not hesitate to call me or writeâ) as well as the ongoing back-and-forth between his administration and its North Korean counterparts signal that he still wants to meet because he still needs a negotiating win heading into Novemberâs midterms. âThatâs his style,â Jack OâDonnell, a former Trump casino executive who negotiated for him and also watched him negotiate, told me. âHe will say anything to keep people thinking that theyâre going to wind up doing a deal thatâs good for them. He gets people to believe, or tries to get people to believe, that theyâre going to get a really good dealâeven though heâs obviously only concerned about getting a good deal for himself.â âHe will be safe, he will be happy, his country will be rich,â Trump said a week and a half ago. âKim will be extremely happy if it works out.â The problem is that what works in business doesnât always work sitting across the table from a 30-something dictator who runs modern-day concentration camps and is bristling with nuclear weapons. âWhen youâre an executive in the private sector and you badly want something, and you canât control yourself when you really should have, you get hurt,â Harvardâs Malhotra said. âWhen you behave this way in the public sector â¦ other people get hurt.â When youâre an executive in the private sector and you badly want something, and you canât control yourself when you really should have, you get hurt. When you behave this way in the public sector â¦ other people get hurt.â Negotiation expert Marty Latz has a book due out this month called The Real Trump Deal: An Eye-Opening Look at How He Really Negotiates. âIf you take a look at the research as to the actual skills that the most effective negotiators exhibit,â Latz told me, âyouâre looking at skills like assertiveness, empathy, creativity, ethicalityâhow ethical you areâand skill sets like those are not necessarily in the DNA of Donald Trump.â The bottom line for Latz on Trump: âIs he truly a masterful negotiator? I would say notâin business, and certainly not to date as president.â And all of this, he said, is so important. âIn fact,â he writes in his book, ânothing may have a more direct impact on the safety, security and prosperity of the world than Donald Trumpâs negotiating skills.â *** Why do so many people think Trump is such a skilled negotiator? Because he says soâover and over and over. Trump leans on a large prop letter âTâ in this 1996 photo. | Getty Images âSome people have an ability to negotiate,â he said in 1984, referring to himself, offering in the Washington Post to represent the United States in negotiations about nuclear weapons with the Soviet Union in the thick of the Cold War. âItâs an art youâre basically born with. You either have it or you donât.â At the time he had some reason to preen. It wasnât arms control summitry, but the conversion of New Yorkâs decrepit Commodore Hotel to the shimmering Grand Hyatt at Grand Central Station was a triumph. It took years. The barely-30-year-old Trump had to convince agents of the bankrupt Penn Central railroad, lenders, brokers and city and state officials to buy into his plan, and he did it with salesmanship, verve, cunning and good timing. The end result when the hotel opened in 1980 was the most generous tax abatement in New York City history and a launching pad for Trumpâs career. âHe was clever,â biographer Gwenda Blair told me, âpushing all the pieces around the board.â Ditto with what he did nextâTrump Tower. He saw an opportunity where others didnât, and he jumped on it, getting the land from a faltering department store and leveraging that to acquire the air rights he needed to do what he wanted to do. He was involved in the project down to the nitty-gritty of dealing with subcontractors. âWe used to get the sub, and we used to sit âem down, and we used to say, âOK, whatâs your best price?ââ Barbara Res, the Trump Tower construction manager, told me. âAnd they would tell us, you know, $5,650,000 or something, and we would say, âOK, go in with $5,800,000, and Trumpâll beat you down. Because Trump had to get his pound of flesh. And he had to believe that only he could do that.â Trump had to get his pound of flesh. And he had to believe that only he could do that.â But Res often was impressed. âDamned if Trump wouldnât get âem down to $5,500,000,â she said. âSo sometimes he actually did better than we did.â How? âNo. 1, maybe he was a little smarter than we were with the sub,â she said, shortening âsubcontractor.â âNo. 2, there was the star factor, you know? We didnât have that, but Trump did. And No. 3, he was very good at âfuturizing.â He called it that. Itâs getting somebody and making them believe they have a future with the company and so they should therefore take less money or do more work or whatever. The last thing he said is he would put them on the mapâand, you know, Trump Tower did put a lot of subcontractors on the map.â Trump had the leverage. And he used it. But this level of discipline and focus started to dissipate in the mid-â80sâstarting, ironically, with Schwartzâs The Art of the Deal deal. It wasnât the only context, though, in which Trump was devil-may-care with his negotiating around this time. As an owner of a team in the fledgling United States Football League, he overspent on players. (In the aftermath, in fact, of his big-bucks signing of quarterback Doug Flutie, he had the gall to ask other owners to help cover some of the costs. And he did it through his now-infamous faux spokesman. âWhen a guy goes out and spends more money than a player is worth, he expects to get partial reimbursement from the other owners,â âJohn Barronâ told the United Press International in 1985.) Trump overplayed his hand, too, when he led the leagueâs lawsuit saying the National Football League was a monopoly. The misguided strategy led to the end of the USFL. Donald Trump and Herschel Walker shake hands in March 1984 after Walker signed a four-year contract with the USFLâs New Jersey Generals, which Trump owned. | AP Down in Atlantic City, Trumpâs first two casinos had opened in â84 and â85, respectively. Boxing was a big part of the show, but Trump left to his deputies lots of the negotiations for fights. âWhen we were meeting with Don King and these guys, no, he was never there,â OâDonnell told me. Trump, he said, was consistently hands off. âHeâs not the guy thatâs sitting down face to face doing the negotiatingâhe just didnât do that with the deals we were involved in. I mean, listen, we did have to go to him, but it was more, âWhat are we willing to pay for this?â âWell, weâre willing to pay $12 million â¦ or whatever the number was. And heâd go, âYeah, get it at 12. That would be great.â But literally that would be a 30-second conversation.â It was not a rigorous process. âSome of the deals we used to do were, âGet it at all costs,ââ OâDonnell said. âIt was just, âGet it.ââ He also on occasion listened to Trump spar with contractors. He came away from the experiences thinking of Trump as a sort of for-show tough guy. âHe postured,â OâDonnell said, âand then when he hung up, he was like, âSo, what did you think of that?ââ Thereâs one year in particular that looks in retrospect like a concentrated accounting for what happens when Trump wants things too badly and underprepares and overpays. In 1988, he bought Manhattanâs Plaza Hotel for $407.5 millionâalmost $60 million more than even a high-end estimate of what the landmark was worth. âHow can I live without it?â he said during the negotiation. Even Trump knew it wasnât prudent. He paid for full-page ads in the New York Times and New York magazine. âI have purchased a masterpieceâthe Mona Lisa,â he wrote. âFor the first time in my life, I have knowingly made a deal which was not economicâso I can never justify the price â¦ â It wasnât his only bad deal that year. In the negotiations that April in Trump Tower in which Trump gained from Merv Griffin control of the casino that quickly would become the debt-bloated Trump Taj Mahal, Griffin found Trump practically manic. âDonald was a case study in impatience,â Griffin wrote in his memoir. âIn his chair, he sat all scrunched up, as if it were a chore for him to remain still. â¦ Periodically, heâd just get up and walk around his office. It was as if he had a blinking sign on his forehead that continually flashed, âURGENT! URGENT!ââ As for the Trump Shuttle? Trump bought and renamed the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle in â88 as well. The price he paid was $365 millionâagain, at least some $60 million too much and maybe more, depending on the estimates and assessments. With a large, golden pair of scissors, Donald Trump and Congressman Charlie Rangel cut a ribbon during the ceremonies marking the Trump Shuttleâs inaugural flight at Washington National Airport on June 8, 1989. | AP Photo The negotiations happened in the Oak Room of the Plaza. âI think our number was 375, 385, and he negotiated it down,â Frank Lorenzo, the former Texas Air chairman, who sold Trump the Shuttle, told me in 2016. âThe price was too high,â said Bruce Nobles, the former president of the Shuttle under Trump, who was involved in the negotiations. It didnât matter. âLorenzo said, âI really want to sell it,â and Donald said, âI really want to buy it.ââ Noblesâ recollections of Trump as a negotiator mesh with OâDonnellâs at the casinos. âHe was, âHereâs my deal, make it happen,ââ Nobles said in a recent interview. âAll the details, in a very complex deal, Donald wasnât involved in this at all. Heâs always been a big picture guy.â (True, says Trump. âI like to work in broad strokes, deal with the big picture, but not the details,â he once wrote.) Trump justified his fast, free-spending ways on the Shuttle deal with the same language he used with the Plaza. âI like buying Mona Lisas,â he said. And all this was when Trump was negotiating from a position of ascendancy and strength. By 1990, though, Trumpâs circumstances had changed. The debts he had accumulated in the late â80sâhe put no money down for the Plaza and the Shuttle, and he financed the Taj with junk bondsânow were threatening to force him to file for personal bankruptcy. To have a chance to avoid that, one of the things he had to do was buildâsomethingâon his 13-block property on the Upper West Side. Up till that point, he had failed to do that, partly because a name-calling feud with New York Mayor Ed Koch meant he didnât get tax breaks he needed to make the project financially feasible. His leverage now severely diminished, Trump negotiated with neighborhood groups that had drawn up plans for a development that was roughly half the size of what Trump wanted. âHe pretty much gave in to whatever they asked for,â said Res, who was a Trump Organization vice president at the time and involved with the efforts on the Upper West Side. âHe was going broke. He really had nothing to bargain with. He caved. And he shouldnât haveâhe should have tried. But he lost his nerve.â She granted: âYou know, itâs easy for me to sit here and judge, because it wasnât my futureâit wasnât my potential bankruptcy. But he hedged his bets. He wasnât going to take a chance on going bankrupt. I can understand. There was so much at stake for him.â Looking back, 1990 represents a significant shift in Trumpâs approach: There would be no more long-term, multiparty, Commodore-to-Grand Hyatt scenarios. Trump Tower would remain the apex of his deal-making acumen. There were still some good movesâhis sale of his majority stake on the Upper West Side to Hong Kong businessmen in 1994 and his bargain-basement acquisition of 40 Wall Street in 1995 proved to be critical money-makers as he clawed his way out of the hole he had createdâbut Trumpâs post-â90 negotiations increasingly were for comparatively uncomplicated branding and licensing agreements, in which others did the harder legal work while he put his name on labels and made promotional appearances.â Most of the deals that he did from that point forward,â Latz, the author of The Real Trump Deal, told me, âwere relatively straightforward, simple, zero-sum deals.â If the myth of Trump, negotiator par excellence, started in earnest with the publishing of The Art of the Deal, the prime-time television show in which he starred cemented it. And similar to the deal he struck with Schwartz to write his book, the negotiation that birthed âThe Apprenticeâ was lightning-quick. Trump agreed with producer Mark Burnett to a 50-50 split without consulting any advisers, according to Trump Revealed. And when he attempted to get a giant pay raise after the showâs wildly successful first season, he â¦ didnât get it. We ended up paying him what we wanted to pay him.â Trump made $50,000 an episode in the first season. In the second season? âHe wanted a million dollars an episode,â Jeff Zucker, the current boss of CNN and former head of NBC, told the New Yorkerâs David Remnick last year. And what did Zucker give him? âSixty thousand dollars,â Zucker said. âWe ended up paying him what we wanted to pay him.â *** A foundational Trump tenet is to declare successâno matter what. A lifelong devotee of Norman Vincent Peale, he says something and keeps saying it to make it so. Even as his negotiations got less complicated and less effective, Trump never stopped self-identifying as one of the worldâs great negotiators. âWe need a negotiator,â Trump said, talking about politics, in 2007 on CNN. âWe donât need sound bites. We donât need people walking off planes, waving, sitting with a dictator, waving, getting back on the plane, waving, and nothing happens. We need negotiators.â âSo you think you could get in there and negotiate world politics?â he was asked. âYes,â he said. âI could do a very good job.â Now Trump is the president. And the people who know him and have worked with him and the experts who have studied his negotiating skills are unsurprised heâs having some trouble in his new role. âHeâs dealing with people that arenât just trying to make money,â Blair said. âTheyâre elected politicians, heads of state, that have their own very demanding constituencies. Itâs really very different than a strict dollars-and-cents motivation that he was dealing with before.â âIt takes a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience to get all these people to come together for a common goal. He doesnât have any experience doing that,â Nobles said. âHe just assumed his force of personality would cause people to forget politics. And thatâs not the way it works.â He just assumed his force of personality would cause people to forget politics. And thatâs not the way it works.â âThere are many more parties,â Res said. âThere are many more issues.â âThe environment in which he is negotiating now is radically different from all of his negotiations over the past almost 50 years in business,â Latz told me. The problem, though, is not that theyâre differentâitâs that Trump doesnât seem to understand that, or at least isnât acting like he does. In spite of his associatesâ contentions that heâs âthe greatest deal-maker our countryâs ever seenâ (Corey Lewandowski) and âan amazing negotiator, probably the best in the worldâ (Michael Cohen), Trump in his first week as president torpedoed negotiations with Mexico about funding the border wall before the talks even began. In the days prior to a scheduled meeting, Trump reiterated that Mexico would pay for the wall, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto reiterated that Mexico definitely would not, and Trump tweeted a threat: âIf Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall,â he mashed into Twitter, âthen it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.â Which is what Peña Nieto did. âAn abject failure,â Latz told me. Similarly, in the health care negotiations last year, Trump faltered againâdue to his overreliance on his âwin-lose, zero-sum mindset,â as Latz puts it in his book, in addition to his lack of preparation that resulted in an inability to understand the nuanced policy interests of different sets of Republicans in Congress. And with North Korea, according to Latz and Malhotra, Trump gave up too much leverage by agreeing so easily to the summit in Singapore. Trump, Malhotra wrote in March for CNBC, âhas given the North Korean leader everything he wants,â and that his decision to meet âvalidates Kim Jong Unâs claim that only a nuclear-armed North Korea will be treated with respect by the Trump administration.â âWhatâs the best thing you can say about Donald Trump as a negotiator?â I asked Malhotra recently. This was before Trump canceled on Kim. There was a long pause. âWhat I will say is that at least in the North Korea deal â¦ at least he has tried to leave the door open to say this may not happen,â he said. âHeâs realizing, a little bit, that he could get completely trapped. And you donât want to trap yourself in such a way that the only way to look good is to do something really stupid.â After Trump indeed backed out last week, Malhotra was ânot surprised,â he told me. âHe was not going to get a deal that was even close to as good as the Iran deal he killed. So the question was how to get out of the mess.â Latz said he expects the summit to happen still at some point, and sooner rather than later. Why? Because what made Trump take the meeting in the first place remains the case. With the other negotiating setbacks, the worrisome swirl of the Mueller probe and the midterms mere months away, Trump needs a win. âHe got himself into an almost untenable situation from a leverage perspective because he had communicated that he really wanted a deal here,â Latz said. âDespite the fact that Trump canceled and sent the signal he doesnât really need the deal, he does really need the deal.â North Korea experts worry about the incoherence and disorganization of Trump and his administration and that they could pay too little attention to tiny but critical details or agree to some type of pact without a firm and enforceable definition of âdenuclearization.â But regardless of what happens from here, a former Trump Organization executive told me, Trump will do what he does. He will try to spin it into a win. âHe believes heâs in a position of strength no matter where or when he is,â the executive said. âYou have to understand that. If you knock Donald on his ass, he will tell you the best position to be in is on your ass.â California By Jeremy B.

        "articles": "Tech companies sponsor parties and try to influence policy at the RNC. | Matt Roth/ By STEVE FRIESS 08/30/2012 03:51 PM EDT TAMPA, Fla. — Walk through the Republican National Convention and it might start to feel as much like a technology trade show as political nominating party, thanks to the branding and lobbying efforts of dozens of tech companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and AT&T. Google wants attendees to sip free lattes in a huge, colorfully designed rec room. Facebook invites attendees to snap pictures at photo booths that post the image direct to a user's wall. Twitter's giving out T-shirts. And AT&T's logo is on RNC signage throughout downtown Tampa, the perk of being the event's \"official wireless carrier.\" The oversized show of force is a big change for many tech companies — from Apple to Yelp — that didn't used to pay much heed to politics or Washington D.C. Now they spend big to fete lawmakers and send representatives to work the rooms as other industries long have. “You have companies spending more time dealing with regulation, dealing with Congress, dealing with the administration, and realizing they need a voice,” said Rey Ramsey, president and CEO of TechNet. “Our power is directly commensurate with the awareness that the tech industry is so vital to the United States economy.” It helps, of course, that tech is a rare bright spot in an otherwise shaky economy. Being present allows politicians to bask in the reflected glow of tech’s record on job creation and innovation, something they're pleased to take credit for however unwarranted. From sponsoring elaborate parties with free-flowing food and wine to hawking their wares on the political elite, the industry came to play — and, in some cases, pay, as sponsorships can cost up to millions of dollars in goods and services. On Thursday alone, Broadband For America sponsors a panel on the nation’s digital infrastructure, Facebook holds an invite-only \"Apps & Drinks\" event for various politics-related app designers to show off their wares to politicians and journalists, and Google wraps up its dominant RNC excursion by linking with the Young Guns Network for one last blowout bash. And those are just the events made public. Behind the scenes and away from the cameras, companies as predictable as Microsoft and Apple or as surprising as Tumblr and Uber are bending the ears of officeholders and hopefuls in hopes they’ll make such matters as tax policy and cybersecurity legislation go their ways. “For us it’s not about sponsoring a ton of events, it’s really about being present in the room, making sure members have our app installed on their iPhones and iPads,” said Luther Lowe, director of public policy at Yelp, at Tuesday’s Innovation Nation party put on to by CEA, ESA, BSA, TechNet and others to fete Reps. Darrell Issa and Kevin McCarthy. “We’ve got a great story to tell, and we want to be able to educate policymakers and their staff about how people using Yelp in their district.” It’s a coming-of-age landmark for many in this industry. Several noted that their members barely understood how much political power they held or why it mattered until the debate over SOPA and PIPA early this year. After a coordinated effort to protest legislation many viewed as stifling to innovation that included blackouts by Wikipedia, Tumblr and others, the bills were spiked and the tech world realized it could impact public policy in a big way. Thus, the arrival en masse in Tampa and Charlotte, something that has not gone unnoticed in the halls of power. “The tech industry is stronger and better organized than ever,” said McCarthy, the House Majority Whip and Southern California representative, before headlining a Wednesday lunch panel sponsored by Google and Bloomberg. “Before, when you’d go to the tech community you’d talk to tech people. Now, I’m seeing young people who are in politics working in the tech community also. You’re beginning to see a marriage of what tech can do to open up politics as well as the tech community understanding how these policies affect them.” Like any big, diverse industry, different companies have different priorities. The Business Software Alliance, for instance, has IP protection atop its list, whereas Yelp is focused on ways to bolster free-speech protections for the commenters who fuel the site’s ratings and advice. ( PHOTOS: Scenes from the GOP convention 2012) There is one uniting issue, however — loosening up regulations to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Every tech executive and lobbyist interviewed by  in Tampa mentioned how the struggle to find qualified labor is inhibiting their ability to grow and, in turn, help revive the stagnated economy. “If you ask any CEO here which would they rather have, lower taxes or more visas for high-skilled workers, every one would take the visas any day of the week,” insisted Joe Green, CEO and co-owner of the campaign software maker NationBuilder. That prediction proved true. GOP leaders spoke from the convention podium about the importance of changing the tax structure to unleash innovation, but few industry figures at panels and events dwelled on that. Instead, they bemoaned the troubled public education system and urged better intellectual property protections. CEO Jeremy Heimans, founder of the tech startup consultancy Purpose, said he has complained to Republican officials in Tampa that “the debate is so boringly focused on the role of government versus the role of the private sector in the most generic possible way.” “The Republican party focus on taxes as being the be-all and end-all of what is required for innovation is just ludicrous,” Heimans said. “It’s about so much more than low taxes. If it was just about low taxes, people would be setting up businesses with real employees in the Cayman Islands.” Heimans’s remarks were a rare example of direct, public partisanship. While Silicon Valley is a hotbed of social liberalism and Democrats, most tried to strike a balance so as to keep avenues of communication open on both sides of the aisle. Ramsey, for instance, said that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney “gets it” on tech because he’s visited the Valley frequently and has a background in starting businesses so “he’ll do pretty well.” But he balanced that by noting that President Barack Obama “has been very accessible to the tech sector” and also has made several pilgrimages to innovative companies across the country. While many of the same lobbyists and execs visit regularly in Washington D.C. with the same politicians and staffers, they said doing so away from the shadow of the Capitol dome has important merits. “You’re dealing with people in a more relaxed setting, and that’s better,” said Matthew Reid, senior vice president of the Business Software Alliance. “It’s great for relationship-building and for seeding some issues that will be covered in greater detail.” The industry’s other purpose in Tampa and Charlotte — hawking its wares — is evident everywhere around Tampa. Well-known social media outlets, from Twitter to LinkedIn, are joined by lesser-known rising stars like Eventbrite, an ticket management site that this year is handling most Romney campaign events, including the rollout of vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in Norfolk, Va. Tumblr, too, is on hand to teach public officials how to use the blogging site better. “I see Tumblr as a particularly good platform for open government and putting constituents in touch with their representatives,” said Liba Rubenstein, the site’s first director of outreach for causes and politics. Being at the RNC and DNC, she said, “is an experiment for us.” Some have thrown their lots in with seasoned Hill vets hired by nascent trade associations and consortiums. “Most of the people I work with and interact with are very inexperienced in terms of the political realm,” said Engine’s Edward Goodmann, a former Senate intern and longtime policy analyst. “They’ve never dealt with Washington, so this is a learning experience for them and I think it’s a learning experience for the policymakers as well because they don’t know as much as they think they know.” Nonetheless, there is some culture clash. Older GOP lawmakers are accustomed to dealing with business leaders their age in suits and ties. Many tech-related executives are under 30 and in Tampa showed up for speeches, meetings and parties in far less formal attire. That takes some getting used to, acknowledged Scott Case, CEO of Startup America, after he appeared on a lunch forum hosted by Huffington Post CEO Arianna Huffington that also included LinkedIn co-founder Allen Blue and Microsoft lawyer Brad Smith. “Whenever people come from different backgrounds and different points of view, there’s going to be a culture clash, but I think it’s more surprising how much we have in common,” Case said. Then, pointing to his own clothes — a tieless, untucked striped shirt, jeans and gym shoes — he said, “Most people we work with on all levels of government are much more open to your ideas and accomplishing something than they are concerned about whether you’re wearing red, white and blue sneakers or not.” This article first appeared on  Pro at 3:43 p.m. on August 30, 2012.

        "articles": "Hillary Clinton's teams said she plans to see Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during the gathering. | Getty 2016 The former secretary of state appears to be baiting Trump with her decision to meet with foreign leaders during the U.N. General Assembly. By NAHAL TOOSI 09/14/2016 03:17 PM EDT Hillary Clinton says she's planning to meet with several foreign leaders during the U.N. General Assembly next week. Your move, Donald Trump. When it comes to establishing an international profile, there's no bigger platform for a U.S. presidential candidate than the annual meeting of world leaders at the United Nations. This year's White House race, featuring the largely untested, less-than-diplomatic Republican nominee, has added a dash of uncertainty to the gathering in New York. Not only can Clinton and Trump use the event to give themselves a statesmanlike glow, they also can send a signal about their foreign policy priorities in whom they choose to see. And international leaders are unlikely to reject the opportunity to meet with the potential next leader of the world's lone superpower, even if he's insulted their countries. Still, \"there’s so much protocol, so much going on. It's so easy to look stupid,\" said Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"The U.N. General Assembly is the type of event where you could walk into a bar and run into a foreign minister from a small country who can't get into the event that you just went to. It's sort of created to humiliate even the most august people.\" Things can get awkward fast. In 2008, GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin used the event to boost her international profile by meeting with a series of world leaders. One of them, then-Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, called her \"gorgeous,\" offered to hug her, and said: \"Now I know why the whole of America is crazy about you.\" Palin smiled and said: \"You are so nice. Thank you.\" Clinton is a former secretary of state with extensive global connections, so she's likely not too worried about a gaffe. A few solid photo ops with world leaders could help boost the Democrat in the wake of the disclosure that she's been suffering from pneumonia and growing frustration among the media about her lack of transparency about her health. The health scare and ongoing revelations about her private email server are hurting her in the polls. By JOSH GERSTEIN Trump's campaign did not immediately say whether he is scheduling any meetings during the General Assembly. But the Republican real estate mogul, who is widely disliked overseas and has little foreign policy experience, met with Mexico's president in a lightning-quick August trip south of the border, proving he's not averse to such theatrical displays. (Like Clinton, Trump calls New York home, and he will literally loom over the event even if he doesn't show up: His gleaming Trump World Tower is just steps away from the U.N.'s headquarters.) Who the candidates meet also could offer hints about their foreign policy goals — and invite backlash from critics. Clinton's teams said she plans to see Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The meeting with Poroshenko is a signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has invaded Ukraine, of Clinton's pledge to be tough on Moscow if elected. It also would be a veiled slap at Trump, who has spoken kindly of Putin and insisted he would get along with the Russian leader. (Putin is expected to skip the U.N. meeting this year.) The session with Sisi could be more sensitive: The Egyptian leader is a military man increasingly defined by his harsh crackdowns, especially on Islamists, and his authoritarian style. Still, Clinton has long insisted that Egypt is a vital ally whose stability is paramount, and she could be trying to ease concerns among America's Arab allies, many of them monarchies, that she will prioritize democracy promotion and human rights over stability in the Middle East. Foreign leaders are unlikely to resist an invitation to meet with either Trump or Clinton, even though Trump in particular has infuriated many of them. The Republican has suggested the U.S. may not fulfill its obligations to defend fellow NATO members if those countries haven't paid enough into the alliance; he's called Mexican undocumented immigrants \"rapists,\" angering many in Latin America as a whole; and he's proposed barring Muslims from the United States, stunning dozens of Muslim-majority nations. Still, the possibility that Trump might win, coupled with a desire to avoid looking like they are taking sides in the U.S. election by snubbing him, will likely compel any foreign leader he invites for a chat to show up. \"I think most of the leaders are not really going to be in the mood to deeply insult him,\" Shapiro said. 2016 By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said another factor that could make the meetings awkward for the candidates is that they don't yet speak for the United States. \"The candidate is not the president so what is it that they are going to say?\" Khalilzad asked. \"You can’t be specific. You can only speak in terms of your philosophical and broad perspective of remaining engaged in the world.\" U.S. presidential candidates' efforts to burnish their overseas credentials have yielded mixed results well beyond the annual U.N. gathering. In 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama traveled to Europe and the Middle East on what is now regarded as a highly successful trip; in a stop in Berlin, the Democrat drew a crowd of 200,000 for a speech in the Tiergarten, a park in the center of the German capital. Obama's challenger in 2012, Mitt Romney, went to Europe and Israel on a trip that ended disastrously, especially after the Republican questioned whether London was ready to handle the Olympic Summer Games. What makes the U.N. General Assembly trickier terrain than carefully choreographed trips abroad is that foes and allies alike are gathering in the same few square miles, and people can simply cross paths without meaning to. A quick handshake with someone can make headlines — like President Barack Obama's 2015 encounter with Iran's foreign minister at a luncheon on the General Assembly's sidelines. A slew of organizations, including many in the activist realm, also hold their meetings to coincide with the General Assembly, knowing that they're more likely to get big-name attendees (and attention to their cause) that way. The events include some very politically sensitive ones, including summits on how to deal with the world refugee crisis and ways to tackle climate change. For years, one regular such gathering has been the Clinton Global Initiative, a program of the Democratic nominee's family foundation, which has come under fire over allegations of conflict of interest and some of its funding sources. This year's CGI, which overlaps with the General Assembly, is expected to be the last one. Clinton is not expected to attend. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Getty By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL 05/10/2016 06:49 AM EDT The fact that Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party scares voters more than it surprises them, according to an NBC Neww/SurveyMonkey poll released Tuesday. Forty-seven percent of respondents said their reaction to Trump becoming the presumptive nominee was fear. Just 26 percent said they were hopeful, while another 21 percent said they were angry and 16 percent were surprised. Thirty-five percent of respondents would be scared to see Hillary Clinton win the Democratic presidential nomination, while 29 percent would be hopeful, 22 percent would be angry and just 7 percent would be surprised. The former secretary of state tops Bernie Sanders in the national poll by 12 percentage points among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, 53 percent to 41 percent with 5 percent undecided. Sanders has closed the gap by 2 points in the past week. Despite that, however, voters overwhelmingly believe Clinton will ultimately clinch the nomination. Eighty-four percent said they think Clinton will win the nomination, while just 15 percent believe Sanders can still win. In a general-election match-up against Trump, Sanders fares far better. The Vermont senator leads the real estate mogul by double digits, 53 percent to 40 percent. Clinton, on the other hand, bests Trump by just 5 points, 49 percent to 44 percent. The poll of 12,714 adults, 11,089 of whom say they are registered to vote, was conducted May 2-8. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.3 percentage points among registered voters and plus or minus 2 percentage points in the Democratic sample. Missing out on the latest scoops?

        "articles": "Voters say by a nearly two-to-one margin that James Comey’s statements hurt President Donald Trump rather than helped him. | Getty By STEVEN SHEPARD 06/14/2017 06:11 AM EDT Voters have greater faith in former FBI Director James Comey to tell the truth than in President Donald Trump, who has disputed the veracity of Comey’s sworn testimony before a Senate committee last week. In a new /Morning Consult poll, conducted in the days following Comey’s appearance before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 45 percent of voters said they trust Comey more to tell the truth, compared with 32 percent for Trump. Twenty-three percent had no opinion. And despite Trump’s insistence that Comey’s testimony represented personal vindication, voters said by a nearly 2-to-1 margin that Comey’s statements hurt Trump rather than helped him. But the survey found little change in voters’ views of Trump and whether his firing of Comey last month was appropriate. The /Morning Consult poll shows that 45 percent of registered voters approve of the job Trump is doing as president — virtually unchanged from 44 percent last week. Exactly half of voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance. Trump’s base is sticking with him: Eighty-one percent of GOP voters approve of his job performance. His approval rating is far lower among Democrats (16 percent) and independents (39 percent). That is consistent with other polls that show opinions of Trump are little changed over the past week since Comey’s testimony. A slight majority of voters, 51 percent, said they watched part or all of Comey’s testimony last Thursday. Asked about Comey’s honesty, a combined 53 percent said the former FBI director is either very or somewhat honest. More voters said Comey’s testimony hurt Trump (43 percent) than said it helped the president (23 percent). But 35 percent of voters said they don’t know or have no opinion about whether it hurt or helped Trump. Among Democrats, 58 percent said Comey’s testimony hurt Trump, while only 16 percent thought it helped him. Republicans said narrowly that Comey’s testimony helped Trump (36 percent) rather than hurt him (28 percent). Among independents, far more thought it hurt Trump (41 percent) than helped (17 percent). Voters are still mixed, following the hearing, on whether Trump acted appropriately in firing Comey. Thirty-seven percent said it was appropriate for Trump to fire Comey, while 44 percent said it was inappropriate.

Views on why Comey was fired and whether it was appropriate have remained largely stable in the days following his testimony.” Voters are actually more disturbed by Comey’s actions after he was terminated. Fifty-four percent said it was inappropriate for Comey to ask a friend to share with a reporter the content of unclassified memoranda he’d composed following meetings with Trump; just 26 percent said that was appropriate. Still, the poll shows voters are unwilling to let Trump off the hook for his missteps because of his inexperience in elected office. Only 27 percent agree with this statement: “President Trump is a political newcomer and unfamiliar with Washington. This should be taken into consideration when considering his behavior.” Twice as many voters, 54 percent, agreed more with this statement: “The job of president demands immediate ability to perform all functions. President Trump should not be excused for behavior because he is a political newcomer.” The poll was conducted June 8-12, surveying 1,990 registered voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.

        "articles": "Illustration by Owen Freeman Politics Inside a decimated partyâs not-so-certain revival strategy. By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE January/February 2017 Edward-Isaac Dovere is chief Washington correspondent at . Standing with some 30,000 people in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia the night before the election watching Hillary Clinton speak, exhausted aides were already worrying about what would come next. They expected her to win, of course, but they knew President Clinton was going to get thrashed in the 2018 midtermsâthe races were tilted in Republicansâ favor, and thatâs when they thought the backlash would really hit. Many assumed sheâd be a one-term president. They figured sheâd get a primary challenge. Some of them had already started gaming out names for who it would be. âLast night I stood at your doorstep / Trying to figure out what went wrong,â Bruce Springsteen sang quietly to the crowd in what he called âa prayer for post-election.â âItâs gonna be a long walk home.â What happened the next night shocked even the most pessimistic Democrats. But in another sense, it was the reckoning the party had been expecting for years. They were counting on a Clinton win to paper over a deeper rot theyâve been worrying aboutâand to buy them some time to start coming up with answers. In other words, it wasnât just Donald Trump. Or the Russians. Or James Comey. Or all the problems with how Clinton and her aides ran the campaign. Win or lose, Democrats were facing an existential crisis in the years aheadâthe result of years of complacency, ignoring the withering of the grass roots and the state parties, sitting by as Republicans racked up local win after local win. âThe patient,â says Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, âwas clearly already sick.â As Trump takes over the GOP and starts remaking its new identity as a nationalist, populist party, creating a new political pole in American politics for the first time in generations, all eyes are on the Democrats. How will they confront a suddenly awakened, and galvanized, white majority? Whatâs to stop Trump from doing whatever he wants? Whoâs going to pull a coherent new vision together? Worried liberals are watching with trepidation, fearful that Trump is just the beginning of worse to come, desperate for a comeback strategy that can work. Whatâs clear from interviews with several dozen top Democratic politicians and operatives at all levels, however, is that there is no comeback strategyâjust a collection of half-formed ideas, all of them challenged by reality. And for whatever scheme they come up with, Democrats donât even have a flag-carrier. Barack Obama? He doesnât want the job. Hillary Clinton? Too damaged. Bernie Sanders? Too socialist. Joe Biden? Too tied to Obama. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer? Too Washington. Elizabeth Warren? Maybe. And all of them old, old, old. The Democratsâ desolation is staggering. But part of the problem is that itâs easy to point to signs that maybe things arenât so bad. After all, Clinton did beat Trump by 2.8 million votes, Obamaâs approval rating is nearly 60 percent, polls show Democrats way ahead of the GOP on many issues and demographics suggest that gap will only grow. But they are stuck in the minority in Congress with no end in sight, have only 16 governors left and face 32 state legislatures fully under GOP control. Their top leaders in the House are all over 70. Their top leaders in the Senate are all over 60. Under Obama, Democrats have lost 1,034 seats at the state and federal levelâthereâs no bench, no bench for a bench, virtually no one able to speak for the party as a whole. âThe fact that our job should be easier just shows how poorly weâre doing the job,â says Massachusetts Representative Seth Moulton, an Iraq War veteran seen as one of the partyâs rising stars. What did Democrats get wrong in the 2016 race? âWe arrived at this point through some combination of either outright offending or at least failing to inspire nearly every segment of our partyâs base voters.â âTim Ryan, U.S. representative, Ohio âDemocrats failed to listen sufficiently to voters, appreciate their discontent with the status quo and articulate how they will fight for working Americans.ââGretchen Whitmer, former state senate Democratic leader, Michigan âPeople and polls were unfairly distracted by unintelligent, racist banter centering on anti-establishment or anti-politically correct views.ââShavonda Sumter, state assemblywoman, New Jersey There are now fewer than 700 days until Election Day 2018, as internal memos circulating among Democratic strategists point out with alarm. They differ in their prescriptions, but all boil down to the same inconvenient truth: If Republicans dominate the 2018 midterms, they will control the Senate (and with it, the Supreme Court) for years, and they will draw district lines in states that will lock in majorities in the House and across state capitals, killing the next generation of Democrats in the crib, setting up the GOP for an even more dominant 2020 and beyond. Most doubt Democrats have the stamina or the stomach for the kind of cohesive resistance that Republicans perfected over the years. In their guts, they want to say yes to government doing things, and theyâre already getting drawn in by promises to work with Trump and the Republican majorities. Theyâre heading into the next elections with their brains scrambled by Trumpâs win, side-eyeing one another over whoâs going to sell out the rest, nervous the incoming president will keep outmaneuvering them in the media and throw up more targets than they could ever hope to shoot atâand all of this from an election that was supposed to cement their claim on the future. Some thinking has started to take shape. Obama is quickly reformatting his post-presidency to have a more political bent than he had planned. Vice President Joe Biden is beginning to structure his own thoughts on mentoring and guiding rising Democrats. (No one seems to be waiting to hear from Clinton.) At the law office of former Attorney General Eric Holder, which is serving as the base for the redistricting reform project he is heading for Obama, theyâre getting swarmed with interest and checks. At the Democratic Governors Association, all of a sudden looking like the headquarters of the resistance, theyâre sorting through a spike in interested candidates. And everyone from Obama on down is talking about going local, focusing on the kinds of small races and party-building activities Republicans have been dominating for cycle after cycle. But all that took decades, and Democrats have no time. What are they going to do next? There hasnât been an American political party in worse shape in living memory. And there may never have been a party less ready to confront it. âWeâre at a space shuttle moment,â says Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who is widely expected to run statewide soon in Georgia. âThe most vulnerable time for the space shuttle is when it re-enters the environment, so that when it comes back into the environment it doesnât blow up. The tiles need to be tight. Iâm concerned about the tightness of the tiles on the space shuttle right now. We have to get through this heat.â *** Problem No. 1: Message What scares many Democrats about Trump isnât any particular campaign pledgeâhis promises to build a wall or keep out Muslims or shut down Obamacare. Those are fights they can wrap their heads around. No, the existential, hair-on-fire threat to the Democratic Party is just how easy it was for Trump to sneak around their flank and rob them of an issue they thought was theirs aloneâeconomic populismâeven as they partied at fundraisers in Hollywood and the Hamptons. It so happens that the most prominent advocate of this viewâMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warrenâis, for the moment, the partyâs most plausible standard-bearer in 2020. The mission now, Warren believes, can be summed up in five words: Take back populism from Trump. âThe American people know what they want,â she said in an interview, urging an emphasis on economic opportunity. âIf Donald Trump and his Republican Party canât deliver on any of that, then the American people will see that heâs not on their side.â Why are Democrats lagging at the state and local levels? âWeâve paid an enormous price for letting our local organizations atrophy to a point of near irrelevance.ââRuben Gallego, U.S. representative, Arizona âIn part, itâs because certain policy ambitions are best achieved on a national level. But that national focus has become myopic.ââStacey Abrams, Democratic leader, Georgia House of Representatives â[Republicans] had a 50-state model approach to winning the redistricting battles. We didnât.ââEric Swalwell, U.S. representative, California Trump has made it easy by stacking his administration with millionaires and billionaires whose confirmation preparations included memorizing the price of milk so they donât seem out of touchâpeople like Treasury pick Steven Mnuchin, whose bank once foreclosed on a 90-year-old womanâs house when she made a 27-cent payment error. âDonald Trump with these appointments is saying squarely to the American people that he lied to them and his promise is worth nothing,â adds Warren. âThatâs the point to keep making.â Connecticutâs Chris Murphy, seen by many as a rising liberal leader of the Senate, makes a slightly different argument. The lesson from Trumpâs win, in his eyes, is how sick voters are of the status quo and pragmatism. Murphy is all for saying no to Trump, but he argues that Democrats need to come up with their own proposals, however unrealistic, and say yesâbig league. Entitlement reform? Forget it, Murphy says: Nowâs the time to talk about expanding Social Security, not shrinking it. âA lot of Democrats laughed at Bernie Sanders when he proposed free college. First of all, thatâs not impossible,â Murphy says, but more to the point, âitâs a way to communicate a really important issue in terms that people will understand.â Illinois Representative Cheri Bustos, a former journalist who has been tapped to help lead House Democratsâ communications efforts, is urging her colleagues to go hyperlocalâa strategy informed by her own success in a bad year for the party. She won by 20 percentage points in a northwest Illinois district that Trump carried by half a point and Obama carried by 17 points in 2012. Bustos wants each member to identify constituents who will be affected by policy shifts under Trump and have district staff promote those people in local media. Tell their stories, she says. Every path back to power runs through figuring out how to get voters to believe again that the Democratic Party, founded on and forever about a fairer economy, is aware that millions of Americans feel the economyâs been unfair to them and think Democrats have no real plans to do anything about it. âTrump is talking about the economy of the past, bringing us backward to an economy that doesnât exist anymore. Rather than going back into the coal mines, weâve got to show how hardworking people in Appalachia can contribute to the new economy,â says Moulton, who is often talked about as a candidate for statewide office and beyond. âThe message has to be: âWe need you, we want you to be a part of the economy.â Weâre not going to pretend that itâs going to be 1955 again, but thereâs a new economy coming and Americaâs not going to succeed if itâs not responding.â This has echoes of how Bill Clinton campaigned in 1992âas a champion of globalization who would make it work better for ordinary Americansâbut that was before so many of the factories had closed, before the culture felt different, before the internet made everything more immediate and more immediately infuriating. Yet Obama and his 21st-century Democrats beat back the Clinton restoration in 2008 in large part by running against the incremental, crabwise approach of the â90s. Bill Clinton was a Southern Democrat who grew up in a world of political constraints, and there arenât too many of those anymore; what the base wants now is Warren-like progressive passion, without any of the liberal self-loathing they sensed in the Clintons. Over emails, texts and phone calls, ad hoc networks of younger Democrats have started to form, eager to talk about a new start for the party. âPart of the work Iâm doing right now is recognizing there is nobody left. Itâs pulling together my peers,â says Eric Garcetti, a 45-year old Mexican-American Jewish mayor of Los Angeles who is widely assumed to be part of the partyâs future in California and potentially beyond. He wanted Clinton to win. But thereâs a certain freedom in moving past Clintonism. âItâs maybe the end of â¦ âThe era of big government is over,ââ he says. *** Problem No. 2: The Politics of Obstruction Itâs been 10 years since Democrats didnât control at least one wing of the federal government, and a lot of them, argues Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat elected to the House in 2014, have forgotten what thatâs like. Those who do, he says, are all basing their thinking on what they did to George W. Bush or what Mitch McConnell did to Obama. âTheyâre scared of the unknown. This is a new world for them. And theyâre trying to find solace in what they know,â Gallego says. Gallego points to his time as assistant minority leader in the Arizona legislature under an all GOP-controlled government, where Democrats held the line until splintered Republicans gave in, allowing them to preserve Obamaâs Medicaid expansion. For whatâs ahead in Washington, heâs pushing a kind of explanatory resistance, refusing any cooperation with TrumpââItâs very dangerous to give this man anything, because anything he does makes him more powerful, and heâs going to use power irresponsiblyââwhile using every fight as an opportunity to promote what the party stands for instead. Trumpâs pledge to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure is one of those opportunities, Gallego says. His idea: Make Trump release his taxes to show that he wonât personally benefit from any provision in the bill, while using whateverâs in the bill to make concrete and specific cases to voters about why the president and the Congress are hurting them, and why Democratsâ intransigence matters directly in peopleâs lives. It sounds reasonable enough, except for one problem: Thereâs no way Republicans, who control every lever of power in the House, will allow it. And thereâs no way the 70-year-old Trump, elected without releasing his taxes and feeling validated by every decision he has made so far, is going to suddenly become a new man once heâs sitting in the Oval Office. The only mechanism Democrats have to actually shape what happens in Washington is the Senateâwith 48 votes that give them an eight-vote margin for error on filibusters and the hope that three Republicans will break away on some votes to join them in the majority. Trump works best with a foil, and theyâre determined not to serve themselves up to him as obstructionists. And here, Democrats have more of a strategy than they are perhaps letting on. In essence, the idea is to focus on issues that drive a wedge through the Republican caucus. On Obamacare, they will step out of the way and let Republicans squirm among themselves. On infrastructure, the plan is to split Republicans between those leery of new spending and those who just want to get along with Trump. Either way, Democrats figure, they win: They could get a bill they support, or send the process into enough of a tailspin that GOP forces devour one another and there wonât be any bill at all. As for Trump, they will just wait him out. âIf he comes much closer to where we are, we could work with him,â Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in an interview, âand that kind of issue unites our caucus and divides theirs.â Many on the left view Schumer warily, suspicious of his breaks with Obama on Israel and Iran, his close ties to Wall Street and his reputation for cutting deals and hogging the spotlight. The base wants McConnell-style, uncaring and unapologetic obstruction, or at least the old Harry Reid, burn-the-place-down and taunt-the-flames kind of pushback. Thereâs already a vast library of liberal freak-out think pieces about Schumerâs refrain that heâs not going to say no to bills just because they have Trumpâs name on them. Whatâs the Democratic Partyâs greatest weakness right now? âOur as yet unmet need for a standard-bearer to move us past the disappointments of 2016 and lead the opposition effort during the Trump presidency.ââCyrus Habib, lieutenant governor, Washington state â[Democrats] are the true champions of economic empowerment for middle-class Americans and those who aspire to the middle class. â¦ But that wasnât successfully communicated in this election.ââElizabeth Brown, city councilmember, Columbus, Ohio âOur inclination to over-learn some of the lessons from the last election. It would be a mistake to lose sight of what has made us the best party to represent a rapidly evolving nation: our inclusiveness.ââCrisanta Duran, speaker of the House, Colorado State Assembly Asked about what heâs been telling Trump in their private phone calls, Schumer is coy. âI said, âYou ran against both the Democratic and Republican establishmentsâif you do that as president, you could get some things done, but if you just let the hard right capture your presidency, like with the Cabinet appointments,ââ Schumer recounts, ââit could well be a flop.ââ Relentless obstruction could easily be a trap, too. âMy worry is that we lose focus. I donât know what outrage to focus on a daily basis, and I worry that our caucus is going to pick way too many things to communicate, way too many things to display outrage about,â Murphy says, âand in the end, nothing will end up translating.â *** Problem No. 3: The Midterms If thereâs anyone who can lay claim to having the worst job in Washington, itâs Chris Van Hollen. A freshman senator from Maryland, he has been charged with leading the Democratsâ efforts to retake the Senate in 2018. When Schumer, who is expected to stay central to fundraising and campaign strategy, announced Van Hollenâs role, he somewhat disingenuously described him as âour first choiceââas in first choice who didnât say no. Schumer and Van Hollen have a complex calculus ahead of them, driven not only by the need to keep the party base energized against Trump, but also the reality that 10 of their incumbents come from states Trump won and may often align with the president for their own survival. Senate Democrats were facing a terrible 2018 map before Trump, with 25 seats up for grabs, and their prospects have gotten notably worse, with races in already difficult spots like Missouri, North Dakota and West Virginia as the baseline, and potentially new territory opened up in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, after Trumpâs wins there. Republicans are defending eight seats, but only one in a state Clinton won. A good way to make Van Hollen stop short and almost laugh is to ask him about candidate recruitment for next year. Sitting at a conference table in the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committeeâs headquarters on Capitol Hill, Van Hollen makes abundantly clear that the math heâs thinking about is how to stay as close to the current 48 as he can. âOur focus,â he says, âwill be on supporting our members, so we can hold the blue wall.â Make it through 2018. Hope for 2020. Van Hollen, who masterminded Democratsâ pickup of 21 House seats in 2008, only to lose 60 in the 2010 midterm wipeout, is seen as one of the partyâs canniest strategists. Itâs early days yet, but he and other top Democrats have already been studying the 2016 election returns in detail, searching for clues that can help them staunch the bleeding in 2018. One intriguing thing theyâve found: All those people who voted for both Obama and Trump look like reliable anti-Washington voters primed to boomerang against the GOP now that the other guys are in charge. Incumbents have been told to act as if theyâre the mayors of their states. Thereâs talk of centralizing around a few easy and direct proposals, much shorter than the Republicansâ old Contract with America. Shortly before kicking off his candidacy, Van Hollen, notably, pitched a plan that would take $2,000 off the taxes of anyone earning less than $200,000 per year, reward savings and triple the child care tax credit. As for those vexing red-state senators, âI donât think anyone is running toward Trump. Theyâre running toward the issues that are important to the people in their states,â Van Hollen says. Maybe so. But get used to headlines about Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin and Claire McCaskill going rogue. If there is hope for the Democratic Party in the short term, itâs in the governorsâ mansions they control nowâand the ones they hope to control in the near future. Governors like Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee in Washington, Jerry Brown in California and Andrew Cuomo in New York are going to be blocking and tackling in their capitols, pushing state-level legislation on immigration, Medicare, environmental standards and reproductive rights. California Democrats have already hired Holder as a sort of warrior-lawyer, anticipating years of legal battles with Trumpâs Washington. On the other end of the spectrum is Montana Governor Steve Bullock, a Democrat who won reelection by 4 percentage points on the same day Trump won his state by more than 20, running on a record of Medicaid expansion, campaign finance reform, equal pay and expanding public educationâon top of having issued more vetoes than any Montana governor in history. Instead of raging against Trump and the Republicans in Congress, Bullock wants to ignore them. âWe as Democrats need to recognize that thereâs no such thing as a national issue,â he says. What should the Democratic Partyâs core message be? âDonald Trump co-opted our core message, which is that voters want their leaders to step up and lead on their bread-and-butter issues. If Trump canât deliver on his promises, we need to show that progressive economic polices are the pathway forward.ââLorena Gonzalez, state assemblywoman, California âWe are the party of opportunity and fairness. â¦ Opportunity requires that Americans have a path to the middle class; fairness insists that path be open to all.ââMike Johnston, state senator, Colorado âTrump wants to take us back to an economy of the past, which simply doesnât exist anymore. Democrats have the opportunity to show how all Americans can be a part of the economy of the future, and how we need the diverse talents of all our people to be at our best.ââSeth Moulton, U.S. representative, Massachusetts All this positioning is building up to a heady 2017 and 2018, with governorsâ races in nine swingy states where a Republican has been in charge the past eight years. Add in likely pickups in blue New Jersey this year and potentially Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts next year, and Democrats could end up with a slew of new governors. âYou want models? I got models,â says Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, whoâs doing another stint as chair of the Democratic Governors Association. Think Bullock in Montana, Roy Cooper in North Carolina and John Bel Edwards in LouisianaâMalloy argues that each 2018 race will need a tailored, locally smart strategy. But if thereâs one tactic that binds them all together, itâs this: relentless aggression. Malloy blames 2016 on Democrats overestimating votersâ ability to see that they were being lied to by Trump and other Republicans. He has no intention of making the same mistake in 2018. âWe canât assume anything,â Malloy says. âItâs going to be hand-to-hand combat.â Some Democrats see a different lesson in 2016, with a takeaway best summed up by a Samuel L. Jackson line from Pulp Fiction: Personality goes a long way. On paper, Trump had none of the characteristics of a successful GOP nomineeâa Manhattan billionaire who bragged about cheating on his first wife with the mistress who later became his second divorce, a closet full of skeletons and a history of cozying up to Democrats? But he was able to connect on such a visceral level that none of those liabilities mattered. What he also showed is how irrelevant parties areâbefore he pulled chunks of the Democratic base away from Clinton, he swallowed the strongest field of up-and-coming Republican leaders in decades, all while throwing conservative dogma in the toilet. Internalize that, Garcetti says, because âthereâs no question that the next generation of voters for the next 50 years will be people who donât wake up thinking about themselves as a Democrat or a Republican.â Pick your movie analogy: People want more Jay Bulworth, less Tracy Flick. It often took a village of Clinton advisers just to produce one tweet; Trump pulls out his Android smartphone and lets loose. âDo your own social media for crying out loud. That authenticity is important,â New Jersey Senator Cory Booker advises. Democrats arenât going to turn into Trump clones, dashing off grammatically challenged 140-character tirades at 3 a.m., but their politicians are trying to unlearn how to be politicians. âEverybody whoâs in elected office, who wants a future in this space, whatever you are, be it,â Atlantaâs Reed says. âAnybody can win right now. But Iâll tell you who will definitely lose: a fraud.â *** Problem No. 4: The Obama Legacy Several times since the election, between knocks on Clinton for running a low-energy campaign, Obama has compared this moment for Democrats to 2004, when George W. Bush was narrowly reelected, the House stayed Republican, and he and Ken Salazar were the only Democrats newly elected to a Republican-dominated Senate. Two years later, he points out, Democrats swept Congress. Two years after that, heâs the president. What Obama conveniently leaves out is how significantly gerrymandering, enabled by state-level losses, has since tilted the House map for Republicans, how different that 2006 Senate map looked from whatâs ahead, and how at this same point, four years out from Election Day 2008, it was pretty clear that Obama and Clinton and John Edwards and probably Biden and Bill Richardson and all the way down to Dennis Kucinich were going to run for president. Now, no one has any idea who the field will be in 2020, and no one outside Washington knows the names that get talked about in Washington. âWith Barack, we skipped a whole generation,â Biden told me in an interview in his West Wing office just over a week before Trumpâs inauguration, when I asked him if he would run in 2020 and what that says about the partyâs lack of young leaders. âThereâs also been times when it looked like there were a lot of qualified people who were younger, and all of a sudden you turn to the older folks in the party.â He didnât name any. Warren might spark a movement, and she could almost certainly count on winning New Hampshire, but she would be 71 and make a lot of Democrats worry she would take the party too far left. Booker can, and likes to assert that he can, tap into an Obama-esque post-racial aspirationalism. Cuomo would have a socially progressive, fiscal centrist record to tout. Many are talking up Kamala Harris, though almost none of them know anything about the new California senator other than that sheâs a multi-ethnic woman; few have heard her speak or couldnât identify a single policy position she holds. Other names get tossed aroundâHickenlooper, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. âThere isnât a clear tier-one level of elected officials jumping out right now,â says Mitch Stewart, Obamaâs 2012 battleground states director and now a Democratic operative working with some of the up-and-coming talent. âThereâs so much more oxygen in the run-up to this next election than there has been previously, that leaders in industry, leaders in nonprofit, leaders in service outside of politics can take a real look at the 2020 race.â And so conversations tip to the likes of Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, Mark Cuban, Tom Steyer, Tom Hanks. Thereâs always the George Clooney fantasy. Meryl Streep wasnât even done with her Trump-bashing speech at the Golden Globes before that idea started going around, at least informally. In the meantime, Democrats face a dangerous period in which itâs not clear who is calling the shots. Obama and Biden have both rethought their retirement plans to help shape the next generation of DemocratsâObama focused more on rebuilding party infrastructure, cultivating the grass roots and potentially meeting with presidential candidates as 2020 gets closer; Biden more engaged with nurturing talented up-and-comers. But both are determined to sit out day-to-day politics, people close to them say, though Trump could easily goad either or both of them back into the fray. Many Democrats want Obama now to be the field marshal on the campaign trail and the architect of the revival, if only out of penance for the eight years of Democratic decimation on his watchâa record that culminated in his sharing a limo from the White House to the Inauguration with a man once thought to be the most unelectable major-party nominee in generations. âYouâre right,â Obama said at his good-riddance-to-2016 news conference when I asked him about those critiques. âWhat I was able to do during my campaigns, I wasnât able to do during midterms. Itâs not that we didnât put in time and effort into it. I spent time and effort into it, but the coalition I put together didnât always turn out to be transferable.â Obama blamed some of the losses on the inherent pushback to one party being in power, some to âdeep-standing traditional challenges for Democrats, like during off-year elections, the electorate is older and we do better with a younger electorate.â âI didnât crack the code on that,â Obama acknowledged, âand if other people have ideas about how to do that even better, Iâm all for it.â *** Problem No. 5: Trump You could park Trump Force One in the gap between Democratsâ capabilities and their ambitions. Theyâre eager to crush Trump not just for the sake of stopping the changes heâs pursuingâthey want to embarrass him personally, and they look at 2020 as a chance to pretend that he was never really elected, that America didnât put him in the same seat as Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. They are petrified that everyone will keep underestimating Trump and will be busy fighting over basic values while the president and his Republican majority roll over them and roll back most of what they fought for during the past eight years. Elections are usually won on pocketbook issues; nobody really knows how it would work to run on abstract concepts like freedom of the press or transparencyâbut many Democrats are tempted to turn their opposition to Trump into a crusade to save America itself. âWeâve never had to have a conversation about reselling democracy,â says Murphy. âLiberals scoffed at his talk of jailing journalists and throwing out major portions of the Constitution, because we just sort of assumed that everybodyâs on board with  this thing called American democracy.â âThe conversations that Iâm having in the cloakroom, in texts and on the phone, reflect a caucus that is not about politics right now,â agrees Booker. âThis is a crisis moment in America.â There is no time for any of it: no time to debate what the party should focus on, no time to recruit candidates, no time to identify new leaders, no time to rebuild Democratsâ core of operations, no time to unpack everything that went wrong in the 2016 campaign, no time to build a legislative strategy, no time to wrap their heads around how much change is coming to America and American politics. After decades of neglect, thereâs nothing else, either. âThe Democratic Party now is left literally at zeroâzero dollars in the bank, zero infrastructure as the Clinton campaign closes up shop,â wrote Democratic National Committee consultant Donnie Fowler in a post-mortem ordered by outgoing interim chair Donna Brazile, âand, most importantly, zero majority control in Washington and in 33 of the states.â On the other hand, Trump could be the Democratsâ salvation. Heâs already deeply unpopular, and midterms tend to go badly for the party in the White House. Itâs tempting for Democrats to think all they need to do is wait for their adversaries to defeat themselves. Or that some reporter will finally discover the Holy Grail of Donald Trump scoopsâthe story that will take him, and the GOP, down. Or that Republicans will continue to overreach and get eaten by a Trump tweet the way they did the very first day of this Congress with the attempt to scrap the Office of Congressional Ethics. Or that the savior candidate will come from nowhere and rescue the party by sheer force of personalityâanother Obama. âElections are only as bad as the next one,â Garcetti says, âwhen suddenly the impossible becomes possible.â Whatever the truth of that statement, the next two and four years are going to be all about Trump. Anson Kaye, one of Clintonâs top media consultants, has been spending the weeks since the election giving a presentation on what happened and what he thinks has to happen now. It ends like this: âTrump is a radical. / Which makes him an opportunity. / Values first. / Stand up (for the little guy/against bullies/in the line of fire) / Talk like a normal person. / Protect the right to vote. / Treat 2018 like a national election. / Target governors and state legislators.â Then on the final slide: âBe clear-eyed about the America we live in.â California By Jeremy B.

In an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" to be broadcast Sunday, host John Dickerson asked Priebus whether the American people should take Trump seriously after he tweeted Friday that the press \"is the enemy of the American people.\" \"I think you should take it seriously. I think that the problem we've got is that we're talking about bogus stories like the one in The New York Times, that we've had constant contact with Russian officials. The next day, The Wall Street Journal had a story that the intel community was not giving the president a full intelligence briefing,\" Priebus said. \"Both stories [were] grossly inaccurate, overstated, overblown, and it's total garbage.\" Over the past couple of weeks, the White House has suffered from damaging leaks and reports of chaos within Trump's administration. Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was ousted following revelations he'd lied about the nature of contact with Russian officials to Vice President Mike Pence. CIA Director Mike Pompeo, meanwhile, denied a report that intelligence was being withheld from the president amid security concerns. \"We spend, you know, 48 hours on bogus stories,\" Priebus continued. \"And the American people suffer. So I do think it's a problem.\" By REBECCA MORIN Priebus also criticized journalists for using unnamed sources. \"If the theory is that the press is supposed to be a free forum of information to speak to the American people, I think it ought to be accurate. And I think we've gotten to a place, John, where the media is willing to run with unnamed sources, apparently false leaked documents to create stories,\" he said. \"We deal with one after the next. I think that the media should stop with this unnamed source stuff, put names on a piece of paper and print it. If people aren't willing to put their name next to a quote, then the quote shouldn't be listed. Period.\" The remarks on sourcing from Priebus, formerly the chairman of the Republican National Committee, drew incredulity from multiple journalists on social media, with many asking whether conversations with administration officials would now be on the record.

        "articles": "Medicaid faces numerous GOP efforts to slash program spending. | AP Photo By JASON MILLMAN 06/05/2011 06:59 PM EDT Updated 06/06/2011 11:19 AM EDT Since Rep. Paul Ryan introduced his budget blueprint in April, Democrats have held countless news conferences and issued even more press releases condemning the plan — as they say — to eliminate, end or kill Medicare as we know it. Yet, for all the Democrats’ posturing and campaigning against Republican plans for Medicare, the GOP budget actually makes more immediate and deeper cuts to Medicaid. But Democrats haven’t been blasting the GOP Medicaid plan with nearly the same fervor, even though Republicans would cut about $750 billion from the program during the next decade and end the guaranteed federal match for states. With intense budget negotiations on the debt limit under way, health care insiders think Democrats won’t budge much on Medicare now that they have a significant campaign chip in their pockets: Kathy Hochul’s upset win in New York’s 26th Congressional District is Exhibit A of the power of Medicare. And that makes advocates worry that Medicaid cuts are more likely to come out of budget negotiations led by Vice President Biden. Medicaid covers more than 50 million people, including low-income children and seniors in long-term care, but it doesn’t pack the same political punch as Medicare. Some observers say that’s due to the lingering perception that Medicaid is just a program for poor people that holds a much less broad-based appeal. That perception is definitely part of the challenge in communicating Democratic opposition to the GOP’s Medicaid plans, Rep. Robert Andrews (D-N.J.) told . Medicaid “doesn’t quite have the same political dynamic” as Medicare, Andrews said. Medicaid faces numerous GOP efforts to slash program spending as states grapple with massive deficits and leaders in Washington try to hammer out a budget deal. Republicans have pushed block grants and easing maintenance-of-effort requirements as their preferred methods of controlling Medicaid costs. Last year’s health care reform law raised the stakes for Medicaid even higher, because the program is expected to add 16 million to its rolls in 2014. While advocates say Democrats have drawn a clear line against the GOP’s Medicare plan, they’re less certain of the party’s stance on Medicaid. At this point, they’re unsure what will come out of the Biden negotiations on the debt ceiling, but they believe cuts are on the way. Some Democrats have voiced their dedication to preserving the Medicaid program as is. “We must protect Medicare; we must protect Medicaid,” Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn of South Carolina told reporters after a White House meeting on Thursday. But they’re not exactly blasting that message from the rooftops. Aside from Sens. Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, very few Democrats have put Medicaid front and center, a health care advocate said. “The message has been Medicare, Medicare, Medicare,” the advocate said. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed a quote to House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer rather than to Assistant Minority Leader Jim Clyburn. Recent polling, however, shows the public may look more favorably upon Medicaid than previously thought. A Kaiser Health tracking poll released in late May found 60 percent of respondents support the current Medicaid structure, 35 percent support block grants and 53 percent favor no Medicaid reductions. Further, about half said they have a personal connection to Medicaid, either because they participate in the program or know someone who does. An April poll from Greenberg Quinlan Rosner showed support for Medicaid was on par with that for Medicare. As Democrats continue to hammer home the Medicare message — and promise to make it a central campaign issue in 2012 — staffers for leading House and Senate Democrats in a closed-door meeting last week urged Medicaid advocates to get their message out. The underlying message, according to advocates who attended the meeting, is that congressional Democrats would rather let outside groups do the heavy lifting on Medicaid. “They know they need to protect Medicaid, but they don’t understand it,” said an advocate who is a former Hill staffer. Members “tend to be wealthier and older, so they just don’t have that interaction, and they don’t speak from any knowledge around it.” Still, another Democratic health lobbyist said last week’s meeting showed commitment to fighting the GOP’s Medicaid proposals. “It’s fantastic that such a meeting took place,” the lobbyist said. Days after the meeting, Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee started to push back by releasing district-specific numbers on how the GOP’s Medicare and Medicaid plans would affect constituents. Menendez, who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, acknowledged in a conference call last week that Medicare has garnered much of the party’s attention. But he drew a hard line against the GOP’s Medicaid proposals. “Medicaid [cuts], certainly in the context of block granting, [are] also not acceptable,” Menendez said. Besides Menendez, Rockefeller has been the most outspoken on the issue. On the eve of President Barack Obama’s April speech on his long-term budget view, Rockefeller issued a stern warning not to cut Medicaid. Obama gave few hints of his Medicaid plans in the speech, but he said changes to entitlement programs are necessary. “I guarantee that if we don’t make any changes at all, we won’t be able to keep our commitment to a retiring generation that will live longer and face higher health costs than those who came before,” Obama said.

By WESLEY MORGAN 09/02/2017 07:32 AM EDT Updated 09/02/2017 12:48 PM EDT Members of the U.S. Army 173rd Airborne Brigade take position during a military exercise in Lithuania in 2016. | Mindaugas Kulbis/AP The U.S. Army’s rapid reaction force in Europe is underequipped, undermanned and inadequately organized to confront military aggression from Russia or its high-tech proxies, according to an internal study that some who have read it view as a wake-up call as the Trump administration seeks to deter an emboldened Vladimir Putin. The Italy-based 173rd Airborne Brigade, a bulwark of the NATO alliance that has spent much of the past decade and a half rotating in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan, lacks “essential capabilities needed to accomplish its mission effectively and with decisive speed,” according to the analysis by the brigade, a copy of which was obtained by . When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the unit's paratroopers were the first American troops to reach the Baltic states to deter another potential incursion on NATO’s eastern flank. But the assessment details a series of “capability gaps” the unit has identified during recent training with Ukrainian troops with experience battling Russian-backed separatists, who have used cheap drones and electronic warfare tools to pinpoint targets for artillery barrages and devastated government armored vehicles with state-of-the-art Russian antitank missiles. Some of the shortfalls, like the brigade’s lack of air defense and electronic warfare units and over-reliance on satellite communications and GPS navigation systems, are the direct results of the Army's years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the enemy has no air power or other high-end equipment and technology.

It was a real eye-opener on the absolute need to look at ourselves critically,” Col. Gregory Anderson, who commissioned the report earlier this year during his stint as the brigade’s commander, told  after it had obtained a copy of the report. “We felt compelled to write about our experiences and pass on what we saw and learned.” The report has so far been distributed only through internal channels to the Army staff and other military headquarters. The analysis comes to light as Russia gears up for one of the largest military exercises in the post-Soviet era — a weeklong war game called Zapad that could involve as many as 100,000 troops and will be held later this month in Belarus. It also comes as the Pentagon seeks to step up its effort to deter Russia, including by rotating other American ground units on a temporary basis into Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries to demonstrate resolve. That’s part of an Obama administration effort known as the European Reassurance Initiative. The 173rd Airborne Brigade, based in Vicenza, Italy, parachuted into Iraq in the early days of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and saw intense combat in Afghanistan. Although its roughly 4,000 soldiers would be no match for a Russian assault on Europe on their own, the 173rd is considered a primary element in deterring Moscow from threatening NATO's borders — particularly since the departure of two U.S. Army tank brigades from Germany was completed in 2013. Yet years of deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, where the 173rd mostly confronted ragtag groups of insurgents, have dulled some of its skills in the type of higher-end combat that Russia has been sharpening in Ukraine, the report found. Some of the problems the report identifies have low-tech solutions that the Army could implement relatively easily. Amazingly, camouflage nets to hide vehicles from enemy helicopters or drones are “hard-to-find luxuries for tactical units.” Defense By BRYAN BENDER and WESLEY MORGAN To fill other gaps, the report pins hope on a pair of new Army vehicle programs that could help the brigade if they are fielded soon enough. The 173rd’s aging up-armored Humvees, designed to protect against roadside bombs in Iraq, would be “easy prey” for Russian armored vehicles, and the report recommends replacing them with the forthcoming Ground Mobility Vehicle, a much lighter-weight, more mobile truck. The Army announced this summer that it is buying nearly 300 of these vehicles from General Dynamics to equip the 173rd and stateside paratroop and special operations units, although none will carry the 30 mm guns that the report recommends some be outfitted with. The report also calls for the brigade to be equipped with a small contingent of light tanks, which would offer much-needed protection to forward scouts against Russian anti-armor missiles. That solution is likely a ways off. The Army is only expected to issue a formal request for proposals for its light tank program later this year, a first step to developing a new weapon system. Even if the service quickly settles on an already available prototype, it will be several years before the new vehicles reach the 173rd or other Army units. In the meantime, the brigade will have to rely on heavy armor units that rotate regularly from stateside bases. The common thread running through the paper is the challenge posed by Russia’s jammers and other electronic warfare tools. An enemy equipped with these “could effectively neutralize a GPS system from 50 miles away using one-fifth the power of a tactical radio,” the report estimates, so “we should assume that GPS will be either unavailable or unreliable for the duration of the conflict if the [brigade] faces a near-peer threat or sophisticated non-state actors.” Here, too, some of the solutions are low-tech. High-frequency or HF radios are more difficult for enemy electronic warfare specialists to pinpoint and jam than the satellite radios that have become the norm for U.S. units over the past 15 years. HF radio equipment and training have fallen by the wayside in the American military during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but not in some allied militaries. The shortfalls have required the 173rd to call on allies from Latvia to help it learn how to communicate in the face of Russian jamming — a stark indicator of how badly knowledge of a key communication method has degraded in the American force. In February, according to the paper, a Latvian military communications specialist spent a week teaching HF techniques to the 173rd, and since then, the brigade’s paratroopers have honed their HF proficiency during a joint exercise with Latvian troops in Germany. To fix the problem, though, the Army needs to systemically resume teaching HF radio communications stateside, the report says. U.S. artillery also relies heavily on GPS, and as the 173rd has learned during exercises in the Baltic states, there is more to breaking that dependency. Before GPS, artillerymen used a set of star charts called the Army Ephemeris to precisely estimate their positions before targeting the enemy — and the Army has not updated those charts in more than two decades. By JACQUELINE KLIMAS and WESLEY MORGAN To better protect against jamming and spoofing and go on the offensive against enemy drones, the brigade and other Europe-based units have recently bought off-the-shelf commercial systems, and a more capable Army system is scheduled to come online in 2023 — but the report says the 173rd needs better jamming gear sooner than that, along with 10 small teams of electronic warfare specialists to use it. Meanwhile, according to a military source who spoke with , a sister unit from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Poland has had to depend on Romanian troops to operate short-range anti-aircraft guns. And the paratroop brigade lacks “essential capabilities needed to accomplish its mission effectively and with decisive speed. “These ideas and proposals are potentially useful for all airborne brigades, and for the Army writ large,” the report notes. Some former Army officers who have read the report agree, and hope the document acts as an alarm bell for the service at a time of renewed focus on Eastern Europe and tension with Russia. “The report is framed as being about the 173rd, but it’s really about more than the 173rd. It’s about what the Army needs to do,” said Adrian Bonenberger, a former infantry officer who fought with the brigade in Afghanistan and now lives in Ukraine, studying and writing about the conflict there. “If Russia uses electronic warfare to jam the brigade’s artillery, and its anti-tank weapons can’t penetrate any of the Russian armor, and they’re able to confuse and disrupt and quickly overwhelm those paratroopers, we could be in for a long war.” Missing out on the latest scoops?
