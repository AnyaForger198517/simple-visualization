        "articles": "Imagine if Mitt Romney were president right now. Imagine if, 722 days after winning the election, President Romney were presiding over an economy growing at five percent a year, an unemployment rate dipping beneath six percent, and gasoline that was less than $2-a-gallon. This is, after all, what Romney promised. Hell, it's more than Romney promised. \"I can tell you that over a period of four years, by virtue of the policies that we’d put in place, we’d get the unemployment rate down to six percent, and perhaps a little lower,\" he told Time during the campaign. December's tumble to 5.6 percent unemployment is, thus, two years ahead of schedule. As for the five percent growth rate and the sub-$2 gas — that's more than Romney dared ask the electorate to expect. Tim Pawlenty — remember him? — promised to nudge growth to five percent and was roundly mocked for his troubles. And to find anyone promising $2-a-gallon gas, you need to dig up Michelle Bachmann's campaign lit (even Newt Gingrich didn't dare predict gas under $2.50, and he wanted to use space mirrors to light highways). It's a view of causality usually found in five-year-olds, but it is pervasive in American politics If Mitt Romney were president right now, he would be seen as the second coming of Ronald Reagan. There would be parades in the streets. The kids would have \"severely conservative\" tattoos. Men would be saying \"gosh.\" This is the problem with how Washington — Democrats and Republicans alike — interpret economic news. If Mitt Romney was president right now the economic numbers would be seen as proof that he was a remarkable success. They would appear to show that his agenda — repealing Obamacare, cutting taxes, deregulating the economy, greenlighting the Keystone XL pipeline — was precisely what had been needed to unleash the awesome growth engine that is the American economy. Conservatism would be ascendant. Liberalism would be discredited. But Barack Obama won the election. The Affordable Care Act hasn't been repealed. Taxes were raised in 2013. Regulation has proceeded apace. The Keystone XL pipeline is no closer to being built. And yet the economy is roaring. The ambitious economic promises the GOP field made for their conservative policies have been achieved despite the continuation of liberal policies. There is an easy liberal interpretation here: President Barack Obama is great. Liberalism is great. And it's simply entrenched media narratives and the GOP's relentless resistance to giving Obama credit for anything that has left his approval rating stuck at 44 percent. Nope, not entirely your fault, either. (Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images) But I come not to praise President Obama. I come to bury the lazy economic thinking that infects American politics and, particularly, political campaigns. Washington tends to think of itself as the cause and everything that subsequently happens in the world as the result. A booming economy is proof that Bill Clinton is a genius, or that Ronald Reagan is a genius. A crappy economy is proof that Barack Obama is a naif, or that George H. W. Bush can't govern. It's a view of causality usually found in five-year-olds, but it is pervasive in American politics. It is also false. A booming economy is proof that Bill Clinton is a genius, or that Ronald Reagan is a genius Policy matters, of course. And, particularly in 2008, 2009, and 2010, it was, arguably, the driver of our economic fortunes. But, for the most part, the economy is driven by much beyond what happens in the White House and the Congress (caveat: the Federal Reserve is an immensely powerful actor, but come campaign time, politicians tend to pretend it doesn't exist). It'll be some time yet before we know whether the economy is truly beginning to roar or the engine is about to sputter out. But the $2 gas that's left economists so optimistic isn't the fault of anyone in Washington; it's a mixture of technological innovation leading to more supply, falling global demand leading to yet lower prices for that supply, and Saudi Arabia refusing to slow production because it wants to choke America's nascent shale-gas industry (Brad Plumer has an excellent look at the causes behind the cheap gas here). The reasons unemployment has fallen below six percent are varied, and some of them are problematic (like the reduction in labor-force participation). Government policy has played a role, and my read of the evidence is that premature austerity, particularly at the state and local government level, did a lot to slow the recovery. Nevertheless, anyone suggesting that the job gains over the last two years are the clear result of anything Congress did, or didn't do, is fooling themselves. It's an unhappy fact of political life that the direction of the economy tends to decide elections even though it isn't actually driven by political decisions. Politicians tend to get around that by pretending otherwise: they take more credit than they deserve when the labor market is doing well, and they receive more blame than they deserve when it's flagging. By the normal rules of politics — the rules we would be playing under if Mitt Romney had won the election — the recent economic news proves Barack Obama is a magnificent leader and liberal policies an economic boon. But the normal rules of politics, at least when it comes to interpreting the economy, are dumb.

        "articles": "I spent the weekend talking to Roy Moore supporters in Alabama. Here’s how they see the world. When Beverly Nelson told her story on CNN about the night in the 1970s when she says Roy Moore sexually assaulted her, her voice quavered, and tears streamed down her face. “Instead of stopping, he began squeezing my neck,” Nelson said, “to force my head onto his crotch.” Laughter breaks out around me. I’m at a community center in Opelika, Alabama, in an office where residents are trickling in to register to vote. I came here to meet Roy Moore supporters, and to play this YouTube clip of Nelson to understand what they saw in it. To them, it was an amusing performance of a political plant, a liar — or at least an embellisher — crying “crocodile tears.” Tuesday’s Senate special election in Alabama will be one of the most closely watched of the year. Democrat Doug Jones has gotten into striking distance of beating Moore, the Republican who has been accused of harassing, assaulting, and pursuing several underage women when he was in his 30s. With the rising tide of women stepping forward to name the powerful men who allegedly harmed them in the past, many of the men — Sen. Al Franken, Rep. John Conyers, and journalist Mark Halperin among them — are resigning or being fired. But Roy Moore has retained the backing of President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee, and his fate lies in the hands of voters. The big question in the race: Will enough Alabama voters dismiss the allegations against Moore to elect him to the Senate? Or will Doug Jones seize this #MeToo moment and become the first Democrat to win a statewide election in Alabama in nearly a decade? If Moore wins, it will feel a lot like the 2016 election in miniature. Trump won the presidency despite a damning video where he admitted to groping women without their permission. The dynamics at play in Alabama are familiar in other ways: Republicans there might elect Moore to office simply because they don’t trust his accusers or the media reporting their stories. A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found that 71 percent of Alabama Republicans don’t believe the allegations, which include Moore pursuing a girl who was 14 when he was in his 30s. Other voters are just unwilling to allow a Democrat to hold a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama. And it doesn’t help that the conservative media is spreading outright conspiracy theories, as ’s Jane Coaston has written. For the past few years, I’ve been reporting on political psychology, probing the scientific theories about how voters think and why. They don’t offer perfect explanations, but they do hint at the kinds of instincts that today’s politicians and media can exploit. Once we’ve picked our team, once we know what we fear about the opponents, our minds reorient the world to protect those thoughts. What I heard in that Opelika meeting house room — and what I heard from conservatives in other parts of the state — provided a window into why. Here’s the first thing to know about political psychology: When we’re deeply loyal to a team, we see the world differently. In sports, penalties are always the other team’s fault. It’s called motivated reasoning, and we often don’t realize we’re doing it. We automatically have an easier time remembering information that fits our worldviews. We’re quicker to recognize information that confirms what we already know, which makes us blind to facts that discount it. It’s not just a Republican phenomenon. This is the tragedy of politics. Liberals are also widely susceptible to conspiracy theories. Some liberals rushed to overlook allegations of groping against Franken. So one crucial reason why Moore’s most adamant supporters don’t see a scandalized politician is that they see a folk hero. “He’s our Johnny Appleseed, our Davy Crockett,” says Thomas Sparrow, who works on the Moore campaign as a volunteer. Moore rose to fame as an elected chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court who was twice removed from office for defying orders from higher courts. The first time, he defied an order to remove a large statue of the Ten Commandments from the state Supreme Court building. Then he refused to recognize the Supreme Court’s decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Moore “knew we don’t accept the court as the final authority,” Sara Jane Tatum, 59, of Opelika, says. And for that, his supporters are grateful and filled with admiration. For Moore’s detractors, his actions were an unconstitutional, grandiose, self-serving stunt. That’s what the US District Court that ruled against Moore’s Ten Commandments display felt. “If all Chief Justice Moore had done were to emphasize the Ten Commandments' historical and educational importance ... this court would have a much different case before it,” the court ruling read. “But the Chief Justice ... went far, far beyond. He installed a two-and-a-half-ton monument in the most prominent place in a government building ... with the specific purpose and effect of establishing a permanent recognition of the ‘sovereignty of God.’” And that is a clear infraction of the establishment clause of the First Amendment. Ann Bennett, a third-generation Alabama Republican living in Opelika, has a very different view. She says Moore’s actions were like the biblical figures Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who refused to bow down to, and worship, a golden statue of a king, and were thrown into a furnace for their disobedience. “Roy Moore has to be one of the highest-integrity people who have ever entered politics,” she says. “Who else gives up the most powerful positions in the state of Alabama, and the money that came with it?” At one point, she joked that Moore may be “far too ethical” for the Senate. Though don’t mistake her for a person incapable of criticizing Republicans. She once worked in Tennessee to prevent legalized gambling, “and here comes this casino operator, and I’m supposed to vote for him? ... He was on the cover of Playboy!” During the primary, she wanted to stop Trump. Her eventual vote for him, she says, was mostly a vote against Hillary Clinton, who would bring “the end of America” — with more liberal justices who would make rulings that many evangelicals abhor on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion. There’s some irony here in that a lot of people see Moore as Bennett once saw Trump: an immoral alleged predator taking advantage of Republican politics. But it’s just so hard to see someone you admire be smeared. It hurts to see them fall. Could that be a fear here, I asked her? Could the pain of recognizing that Moore did something immoral be steering you away from taking these accusations credibly? Bennett turned it around. “What happened to Roy Moore is the scariest thing in the world,” she says. “That any of us could live a life of complete integrity, and have your name ruined forever. And then have your name ruined with false allegations.” Why do we have motivated reasoning in the first place? It’s frustrating and illogical, and it makes conflicts intractable. The leading theory is that we often see our group identity as being part of our individual identity. When there’s a threat to the group, it’s a threat to the self. “When our self feels attacked, our [brain is] going to bring to bear the same defenses that it has for protecting the body,” Jonas Kaplan, a psychologist at the University of Southern California, told me earlier this year. It’s like we have an immune system for uncomfortable thoughts. And you can see it working in real time, trying to sort out why a damning piece of evidence might not be so bad after all. In the CNN clip, Nelson says Moore locked the door when she protested. This is ridiculous, my companions in Opelika said. “The only way you can’t get out of a locked door is with child-proof locks,” Bennett says. And child-proof locks didn’t exist in the ’70s. But he was larger than her, I say. He could have forced her to stay inside regardless. Exactly, Bennett says. “If he wanted to do anything, he would have done it,” she says. “If he was turned on, he would have done it. He’s strong, he was into martial arts, he would have done it. He would have raped her.” The fact that Moore didn’t rape her (Nelson does not allege rape), that he relented, is proof enough. I asked, is there anything that would make you believe Nelson? “A blue dress,” she said, referring to Monica Lewinsky’s infamous semen-stained garment. There are endless ways to cast doubt on Moore’s accusers’ stories, or to diminish them. Why did these women wait decades to come forward? Why did these allegations only come out in the weeks before the elections? Back in the ’70s, plenty of older men dated teenagers, I was told. Plenty of Vietnam veterans like Roy Moore came back to the United States and forgot their manners around women. For other voters I talked to, it seemed like the discomfort they felt about the possibility of a Democrat winning the Senate seat led them to find ways to avoid thinking about the evidence against Moore. “Yes, these women should be believed, but so should Roy Moore,” Caleb Parker, 34, a Birmingham resident and member of the Greater Birmingham Young Republicans, says. He doesn’t see Moore as folk hero. But he does see him as a Republican, a member of his party that he ought to support. “This whole convicting people in the court of public opinion is a scary thing for this country to be doing. ... It’s better to stay above he-said, she-said arguments” But it’s not he-said, she-said, I pointed out. It’s he said, she said, she said, she said. “People dogpile on people all the time and it’s not true,” Parker says, mentioning the 2006 case where a woman brought false rape allegations against Duke lacrosse players. He also doesn’t like that Franken is stepping down amid groping allegations. “I do not like Al Franken, I do not agree with what he did, but running people out on allegations alone, without a trial, is a scary place for this country to be in.” It’s also important to mention that Moore’s candidacy has broken some Republicans out of a stubborn partisan mindset. Alabama’s senior senator, Republican Richard Shelby, told CNN, “I couldn't vote for Roy Moore.” If elected, Moore faces investigation and possible expulsion from members of his own party. Plenty of Republicans will be sitting out the vote or writing in a different candidate. Which means Moore has brought the state to the brink of something unthinkable just a few months ago: electing a Democratic senator. “To me, [Moore’s tenure at the Alabama Supreme Court] doesn’t indicate good Christian philosophy; it seems to be self-aggrandizement,” says Michael Bullington, 23, a member of the Greater Birmingham Young Republicans, a group that publicly withdrew support from Moore. Bullington was especially put off by Moore’s refusal to agree to the higher court’s ruling on the Ten Commandments display. “There’s no way to be an [Alabama] Supreme Court judge without recognizing there are other judges that have authority over you,” he says. “And that’s the basis of our judicial system. The way that he twists it, that he’s fighting this grand crusade, that’s not right for me.” Throughout history, people have always interpreted political stories in different ways. Here’s what’s changed today: There are more structures, technologies, and social norms in place to further wedge us apart. There’s a conservative media ecosystem built to fortify the conservative worldview. There’s Facebook, whose algorithms make sure we may never have to read an opposing viewpoint. Reality is fracturing around partisan lines, and the divides seem to only be growing deeper. We’ll remain blind to it, because it’s much easier to spot bias in another person than it is to recognize it in yourself. One Auburn, Alabama, resident supporting Moore told me, “I might be biased, but I’m right.” And then there’s Trump, throwing gasoline on this motivated reasoning engine. “Trump, in trying to combat the media, delegitimized the media, and has created an environment in which conspiracy theory is normalized,” Asheley Landrum, a Texas Tech University psychologist who studied motivated reasoning, says. “And that’s not to mean that everyone is a conspiracy theorist, and that people who believe in conspiracy theories are dumb.” Believing in conspiracy theories, psychological research informs us, is a coping mechanism to deal with uncertainty in the world. “It’s a self-protective mechanism people have,” Jan-Willem van Prooijen, a psychologist who studies conspiracy theories, told me earlier in the year. When conservatives say they believed Hillary Clinton would have represented “the end of America,” they believe it. Wins for Democrats mean more liberal judges who will rule on social matters like same-sex marriage and abortion that they fear will continue to degrade the country. When they say they want to “take America back,” they’re fearful that rising immigration will threaten their status in the country. They’re scared. And the denials of misconduct around Roy Moore are tinged with conspiracy theory. How else should we describe arguments made by Moore backers that someone, maybe George Soros, must be paying these women? These theories have none the proof Moore backers are demanding of his accusers. They’re compelling nonetheless, and becoming harder to debunk. A recent Poynter survey found just 19 percent of Republicans have confidence in the media, and that “almost half of Americans — 44 percent — indicate that they believe the news media fabricates stories about President Trump more than once in a while.” On Friday, reality around Roy Moore fractured again. News broke that Nelson added a note underneath where Roy Moore signed her high school yearbook (she offered the signature as evidence Moore knew her when she was a teenager). In one view, this means nothing. So what — she added the date and location of where the yearbook had been signed? Through the looking glass, the conservative media took this to mean Nelson admitted to forging the signature itself. And I fear this fracturing will continue. If Moore is elected, members of his own party have said they’d start an ethics investigation and possibly vote to expel him from the Senate. “I am so angry at the thought that they might not seat him,” Bennett says. “That is like Civil War stuff for me.” We have a request In moments like this — as people grapple to understand variants and vaccines, and kids head back to school — many outlets take their paywalls down. ’s content is always free, in part because of financial support from our readers.

        "articles": "Mitch McConnell says Obamacare’s problem is it insures too few and deductibles are too high. So will he fix it? On Sunday’s Face the Nation, Sen. Mitch McConnell teed off on the Affordable Care Act: MCCONNELL: Well, what you need to understand is that there are 25 million Americans who aren’t covered now. If the idea behind Obamacare was to get everyone covered, that’s one of the many failures. In addition to premiums going up, copayments going up, deductibles going up. And many Americans who actually did get insurance when they did not have it before have really bad insurance that they have to pay for, and the deductibles are so high that it’s really not worth much to them. So it is chaotic. The status quo is simply unacceptable. This is, I think, the correct case to make against Obamacare. It really didn’t cover everyone. Premiums, copays, and deductibles really are too high — 43 percent of enrollees have a deductible above $2,500. There are a lot of people being pushed to buy insurance that will break their budget before they ever get to use it. But here, then, is the question McConnell needs to answer: Is he promising the Republican replacement will feature more coverage and lower premiums, copays, and deductibles? I asked McConnell’s office this question and didn’t get very far with it. His spokesperson, Don Stewart, said: “The smart play with McConnell is not to go looking for interpretation, but rather just listen to what he says.” Okay, I replied, but if McConnell is saying that the status quo, with 25 million uninsured and high deductibles, is unacceptable, then is it reasonable to assume he would be against a replacement that led to less coverage and higher deductibles? “He's been clear not to pre-define the replacement measures other than to say it won't be one single bill,” Stewart said. In an op-ed released Monday, McConnell criticizes the Affordable Care Act almost entirely by quoting Democrats criticizing high premiums, sparse competition on certain exchanges, and insurance that’s often too expensive to us. But, again, he refuses to say whether he will insist that any Republican replacement actually fix these problems. It’s typically true in politics that when elected officials criticize a bill for its specific outcomes, they want to pass legislation that responds directly to those criticisms. But it’s not true here. Republicans are caught between the criticisms of Obamacare that are popular to make and the plans they actually want to pass. I’ve read a number of the Republican replacement plans floating around. All of them would lead to more Americans without health insurance coverage, much higher deductibles, or both. Take Rep. Tom Price’s Empowering Patients First Act. Price, a Georgia Republican and former surgeon, is Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services. His legislation is among the more detailed Obamacare replacement proposals. It repeals Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, its subsidies, its insurance regulations, and its consumer and out-of-pocket protections. In place of all that, Price creates an age-based tax credit for people buying insurance on their own (you aren’t eligible if your employer or the government pays for your care) that ranges from $900 for children under 18 to $3,000 for those 51 and older — a tax credit, in other words, that doesn’t come near covering the cost of decent insurance coverage. Obamacare’s tax credits are more generous for people who earn less money. But Price’s are the same for everybody — and you can see how that creates new winners and losers in the chart below. The Empowering Patients First Act does less for those who need help most and more for those who need help least. It’s possible that’s a politically popular path to take. But helping folks who make $50,000 a bit more will come at the cost of watching a lot of people who make $20,000, or nothing, fall through the cracks entirely. Deregulating insurance interacts with all this in tricky ways. Imagine a 52-year-old unemployed steelworker in Ohio who currently receives Medicaid. Right now he gets health insurance with virtually no out-of-pocket costs. Under Price’s plan, he gets $3,000 to buy care on the open market. Right now the cheapest plan available in Franklin, Ohio, for a 52-year-old male is $4,738 with a whopping $7,150 deductible. It’s an awful plan, and even that may not be affordable. Price has an answer to that. He’s also repealing most of Obamacare’s regulations governing the services insurers must cover. There are no limits on out-of-pocket costs, as there are in Obamacare. There are no essential benefits, as there are in Obamacare. Insurance that covers less costs less. But this goes both ways. Obamacare, for instance, limits how much more an insurer can charge a 52-year-old than a 20-year-old. That makes insurance more costly for 20-year-olds but much cheaper for 52-year-olds. Price repeals those regulations. A 52-year-old shopping for insurance is thus likely to be offered coverage that costs more and covers less than what’s on offer now. That is what most Americans call “really bad insurance.” Will McConnell be more comfortable with a system that pushes those kinds of plans? Will Donald Trump? Will voters? There’s much that’s complicated in the world of health policy. But the cost of insurance is relatively simple. Insurance is expensive because medical care is expensive. In 2016, the average employer-purchased policy cost $6,435 for an individual. That’s a good benchmark for what most people consider decent coverage. Coverage that costs less than half that much — if you can find it — is cheap because it covers fewer medical costs, fewer medical treatments, or fewer people who really need medical care. There’s no magic here. Donald Trump likes to say he’s going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with “something terrific.” Sadly for everyone, that’s probably not possible. What is possible is repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something that makes a different set of equally painful trade-offs. Price’s plan, to its credit, is clear about its trade-offs. It costs less than the Affordable Care Act but covers far fewer people, and the people it does cover get much stingier insurance. It lowers taxes on the wealthy but kicks the poor off of Medicaid. It makes coverage cheaper for younger, healthier people by repealing regulations that keep it affordable for older, sicker people. It lowers insurance premiums by allowing insurers to increase deductibles and reject more claims. It gives more subsidies to the middle class and rich but gives much less to the poor. Price’s plan also has a version of Obamacare’s hated “Cadillac Tax” — it caps the tax exemption for employer-provided insurance at $20,000 for a family and $8,000 for an individual. If your problem with the status quo is that 25 million people remain uninsured and too many Americans are finding that their only choice is “bad insurance” with deductibles so high that they can’t really use it, you’re not going to like Price’s plan much. Is that McConnell’s position? You would think so from listening to him on Face the Nation. In truth, I think that’s not actually his position: He is pointing out the failings of Obamacare that are unpopular and thus leave the law politically vulnerable. I think his real problems with Obamacare have more to do with its taxes and regulations, and he would be willing to see less coverage, and less usable insurance, if that was the path to lower taxes and less regulations. But that may not be a popular path forward. The Kaiser Family Foundation polled Trump voters on the Affordable Care Act, and their priorities diverge sharply from those of congressional Republicans. The Medicaid expansion, Medicare taxes, and out-of-pocket limits are among the Obamacare provisions that elected Republicans like least. But all three are popular even among Trump supporters: In our interview last week, President Barack Obama outlined the trade-offs he would like to make to improve Obamacare. He wants to raise taxes on the rich to increase subsidies to the poor, and to add a government-run public insurance option. Pumping more money into subsidies would certainly lead to more people being covered and lower premiums and deductibles, but I doubt McConnell would like it. As I’ve written before, what Republicans hate about Obamacare and what Americans hate about Obamacare are different. But this is a tricky two-step. Republicans have spent years now bemoaning the parts of Obamacare Americans hate. It’s going to be very difficult to pivot to a health care system that make those things even worse.

        "articles": "When partisan cues aren’t present, voters say they like many ideas in the For the People Act. Back in March, the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer obtained a recording of an adviser to Mitch McConnell privately bemoaning, on a call with conservative group leaders, that Democrats’ big voting rights bill, the For the People Act, polled quite well. “When presented with a very neutral description” of it, “people were generally supportive,” the adviser said. A new Data for Progress poll conducted as part of a partnership with  backs up that assessment. The poll surveyed 1,138 likely voters nationally between April 16 and April 19, and it finds that much of what the 800-page bill claims to do is overwhelmingly popular. More than 80 percent of respondents said they supported preventing foreign interference in elections, limiting the influence of money in politics, and modernizing election infrastructure to increase election security. More than 60 percent of respondents supported requiring nonpartisan redistricting commissions, a 15-day early voting period for all federal elections, same-day registration for all eligible voters, automatic voter registration for all eligible voters, and giving every voter the option to vote by mail. ’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. There are, of course, a few caveats. The poll presented these questions without partisan cues about which party supports which proposal. Indeed, the one question that mentioned the parties — about whether Democrats should change Senate rules so they could pass redistricting reform without Republican support — was much more closely divided. (Forty-seven percent of respondents said they supported doing this, and 42 percent said they opposed it.) The questions also didn’t spotlight Republicans’ preferred arguments — for instance, Republicans would stress concerns that same-day and automatic registration could allow ineligible people to vote, which would likely make some respondents more concerned about these proposals. And other parts of the bill, like its limits to voter ID laws (it would allow voters without ID to submit a sworn statement vouching for their identity) and its creation of a public financing system to match small donations, may be more controversial. Voter ID requirements generally poll quite well and support for public financing can vary greatly based on question wording. (In polling for a separate client, Data for Progress found 56 percent support for one detailed description of the For the People Act’s matching program, but the conservative polling firm Echelon Insights found very little support for the general concept of “using government dollars to match donations to political campaigns.”) The poll also asked about a competing redistricting reform proposal not currently in the For the People Act — setting proportional standards such that, if a party wins about half of votes in a state, it should win about half the seats. (I recently wrote about the debate among Democrats over this idea.) This got less support than any of the other provisions above but still was backed by 51 percent of poll respondents, with 34 percent saying they opposed this. In any case, Democrats’ problem when it comes to enacting the For the People Act isn’t the polls — it’s the Senate filibuster. The bill that already passed in a near party-line vote in the House will require a 60-vote supermajority to pass in the Senate. Since no Republican support appears to be in the offing, activists have argued that the Senate should change its rules to let the bill pass. But moderate Democratic senators don’t want to do this. One key holdout, Joe Manchin, told me in a recent profile that he fears passing a major voting bill on party lines would only further divide the country. He argued that 20 to 25 percent of the public already doesn’t trust the system and that a party-line overhaul would “guarantee” that number would increase, leading to more “anarchy” like that at the Capitol on January 6. He added, “I just believe with all my heart and soul that’s what would happen, and I’m not going to be part of it.” Unless he changes his mind, the For the People Act can’t pass the Senate. Update: This piece was updated to add polling on the For the People Act’s public financing provision that Data for Progress conducted for a separate client.

        "articles": "The judge blocked funding meant to support wall work in Arizona and Texas. A federal judge in California issued a ruling Friday night that blocks a plan by the Trump administration to channel federal money towards the construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border. President Trump used a national emergency in February to begin the process of diverting the funds from the military and other sources; for now, at least some of that money must stay where it is. The decision by Judge Haywood Gilliam, who was appointed to the federal bench during the Obama administration, specifically blocks the “reprogamming” of $1 billion in Army personnel funds for wall projects in Yuma, Arizona and El Paso, Texas. The suit was brought by the Southern Border Communities Coalition, a group of activists in the border region who work with the American Civil Liberties Union (which acted as counsel), and the Sierra Club. The plaintiffs contended that harm would be done to their communities by the wall construction projects; they argued the projects were illegal due to the manner in which the administration sourced its funding. In his decision, Gilliam explained that he issued an injunction halting the use of the money because the Trump administration sought to circumvent Congress’s role as the branch of government with the power to appropriate federal funds. “Congress’s ‘absolute’ control over federal expenditures — even when that control may frustrate the desires of the Executive Branch regarding initiatives it views as important — is not a bug in our constitutional system,” Gilliam wrote in a 56-page decision. “In short, the position that when Congress declines the Executive’s request to appropriate funds, the Executive nonetheless may simply find a way to spend those funds ‘without Congress’ does not square with fundamental separation of powers principles dating back to the earliest days of our Republic.” As Gilliam notes, the executive branch did try to go through Congress in getting border wall funding. ’s Dara Lind reports that lawmakers gave the White House $341 million in 2017 and $1.375 billion in 2018 to upgrade and repair to existing wall infrastructure. A fight over wall funding that led to an extended government shutdown early in 2019 ended in an agreement for an additional $1.375 billion. This was far less than the $5.7 billion Trump hoped to receive, and after the government reopened, he declared a national emergency, announcing plans to use the powers given to him by the National Emergencies Act to use federal funds to make up the difference. Gilliam took aim at this use of presidential emergency authority — which by statute is meant to be invoked during “unforeseen” circumstances — writing that the issue of border wall money was in no way unforeseen. The judge noted Trump first began discussing possible ways of paying for an extended US-Mexico border wall during his 2016 campaign and that he looked to Congress for wall money on multiple occasions: “Defendants’ argument that the need for the requested border barrier construction funding was ‘unforeseen’ cannot logically be squared with the Administration’s multiple requests for funding for exactly that purpose dating back to at least early 2018.” Gilliam also wrote that although the Department of Defense (DoD) was asked to take the unusual step of reallocating the $1 billion in funds and making them available to the Department of Homeland Security without first asking Congress if it could do so (as is custom), the fact that the situation is extraordinary does not make it unforeseen. “There is no logical reason to stretch the definition of ‘unforeseen military requirement’ from requirements that the government as a whole plainly cannot predict (like the need to repair hurricane damage) to requirements that plainly were foreseen by the government as a whole (even if DoD did not realize that it would be asked to pay for them until after Congress declined to appropriate funds requested by another agency). Nothing presented by the Defendants suggests that its interpretation is what Congress had in mind when it imposed the ‘unforeseen’ limitation, especially where, as here, multiple agencies are openly coordinating in an effort to build a project that Congress declined to fund.” In another interesting shot, Gilliam pointed out in a footnote that the government hasn’t actually done much with the money that Congress did appropriate for barrier construction: “The Court observes that, although Congress appropriated $1.571 billion for physical barriers and associated technology along the Southwest border for fiscal year 2018, counsel for the House has represented to the Court that the Administration has stated as recently as April 30, 2019 that CBP represents it has only constructed 1.7 miles of fencing with that funding … This representation tends to undermine Defendants’ claim that irreparable harm will result if the funds at issue on this motion are not deployed immediately.” The administration has used the funds appropriated in 2017, having nearly completed the work on the 40 miles of wall that $341 million was meant to cover; it planned to begin using the money reprogrammed from the Army personnel funds Saturday. The executive branch is now left with a few options: It can appeal the decision; it can also work to find other sources of funding for the projects blocked by the injunction; and, it could also move its focus to other areas of the border beyond Yuma and El Paso, the two areas mentioned in the ruling. President Trump signaled on Twitter the White House will pursue the first option, writing, “This is a ruling against Border Security and in favor of crime, drugs and human trafficking. We are asking for an expedited appeal!” Another activist Obama appointed judge has just ruled against us on a section of the Southern Wall that is already under construction. This is a ruling against Border Security and in favor of crime, drugs and human trafficking. We are asking for an expedited appeal! While launching new wall projects elsewhere along the border remains an option, doing so could prove be a difficult proposition — Gilliam wrote the plaintiffs could return to court seeking new injections if that happens. This is likely to be just one step in what is likely to be an ongoing legal fight. Indeed, House Democrats have also filed a lawsuit against the White House’s emergency wall funding efforts — using a precedent established by House Republicans during the Obama years, in seeking to stop administration spending efforts. In a hearing this past Thursday, though, Trump-appointed Judge Trevor McFadden expressed skepticism about involving the judiciary in the fight, asking if Congress had, “utilized all the tools at its disposal before rushing to court.” We have a request In moments like this — as people grapple to understand variants and vaccines, and kids head back to school — many outlets take their paywalls down. ’s content is always free, in part because of financial support from our readers.

        "articles": "Monday’s big news revealed Mueller’s strategy: treat the Trump campaign like the mafia. Monday’s big Russia-related news shows that special counsel Robert Mueller is treating his probe into election collusion like a mob case — with President Donald Trump potentially playing the role of Al Capone. Early on Monday morning, FBI agents took Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his aide Richard Gates into custody. The two men were indicted on charges of money laundering and illegal lobbying charges on behalf of Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych (charges to which they pleaded not guilty). About two hours later, we learned that Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to charges of lying to the FBI. He admitted to lying, specifically, about meetings in which he discussed potentially colluding with Russian agents to acquire Hillary Clinton’s private emails. Put together, the charges against the three men illustrate a clear pattern of using whatever charge you can stand up — even if it doesn’t directly relate to the Russian collusion — to build a case against anyone who was involved, with the ultimate goal of getting the lower-level people to testify against the bigger fish. You’ve probably heard of this kind of approach in mob movies, but it’s also what real prosecutors do. Experts say that Mueller is adapting this playbook for the Russia investigation. “The idea that he would go after the campaign manager of the Trump campaign is just extraordinary — it means he must have great confidence in the case against Manafort,” says Ryan Goodman, a former Department of Defense special counsel and editor of the legal publication Just Security. “It does compare to prosecutions of organized crime, with respect to going after someone who is legally exposed … and trying to flip them if they have the kind of information that could really break open the case.” What this means, then, is that the Manafort/Gates/Papadopoulos cases are not intended to stand alone. They are the first blood in a battle that will likely involve more and more members of Trumpworld as time goes on — with indictments going as high as the evidence and law support. Already, experts say, there’s a clear next target in sight: former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who lobbied for a foreign power without proper paperwork, as Manafort reportedly did, and allegedly lied the FBI, as Papadopoulos reportedly did. “Flynn looks like he’s in the crosshairs here for sure,” says Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School. When the feds went after Al Capone in the late 1920s, they couldn’t get him on the kind of charges (murder, bootlegging, etc.) that you’d expect. The only thing they could really prove was that he had been hiding the profits from his criminal enterprise, which led to a conviction on tax evasion. It’s a famous story because it illustrates how any misstep by a criminal can be used to roll him up — even if it’s not the most serious crime the criminal in question actually committed. Prosecutors going after organized crime today use the Capone gambit relatively frequently. Drug cartel members aren’t always prosecuted on charges of distributing drugs — it’s often gun running, or money laundering, or all sorts of other things that aren’t directly related to the core criminal conspiracy under investigation but are still clearly illegal. Mueller is clearly using this same strategy to Manafort and Gates. Not a single one of the combined 12 charges leveled against the two men alleges any wrongdoing related to Russian interference in the election. The White House is claiming that this shows the charges have nothing to do with Trump — but if anything, it’s more likely to mean the opposite. What Mueller’s team alleges, specifically, is that Manafort lobbied on behalf of Yanukovych, a former president of Ukraine, for years without registering under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). They further allege that Manafort hid the profit from this undisclosed lobbying, with Gates’s assistance, and laundered it through a series of different front companies and properties. For example, Manafort reportedly bought a condo in New York with Yanukovych money and rented it on Airbnb, then told authorities that one of his daughters and her husband lived there in order to dodge taxes on the rent. These charges appear to have grown out of Mueller’s initial investigation into Russia’s role in the election. Yanukovych was a tight Kremlin ally, to the point where he fled to Russia after he was deposed in a popular uprising in early 2014. It would be absurd to look into the Trump-Russia case without investigating Manafort’s links to Yanukovych, an investigation that uncovered evidence of unregistered lobbying and money laundering. “Mueller has the explicit authority to investigate ‘links’ or ‘coordination’ between the Trump campaign and Russia, but also other allegations that ‘arise’ directly from that investigation,” Jens David Ohlin, vice dean of Cornell Law School, said in emailed comment. “[The charges] are clearly within the special counsel's mandate.” Part of the intention here is simply to punish Manafort (and, to a lesser extent, Gates) for committing criminal acts. “I think Paul Manafort is in trouble on his own,” Wright says. “I don’t think the only investigative interest is in his proximity to Trump.” But the Trump campaign is, at root, Mueller’s core foundational interest — which means that the Manafort and Gates arrests are part of a bigger play. The ultimate goal, experts say, is to offer them a plea deal in exchange for information on the core aim of the investigation: uncovering any criminal misconduct relating to Russia’s role in the 2016 election. Manafort was not only the campaign manager for months but was present at some vital moments — most notably, the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting set up by Donald Trump Jr. to discuss potentially acquiring information on Clinton from Russia. They are, in short, marrying the Al Capone tactic of prosecuting quasi-related criminal wrongdoing with a broader strategy of trying to get Trump campaign members to turn states’ evidence in exchange for plea deals. If you tell us what you know about Russia, Mueller is suggesting, we might go easy on the other stuff. “Mueller is likely trying to flip Manafort [because] Manafort is at the center of all things, potentially, when it comes to Russian collusion,” Goodman says. Papadopoulos is a small fish, at least compared to Manafort. Papadopoulos, who is 30 years old and recently listed Model UN experience as a line on his résumé, played a relatively minor role in the Trump campaign. It’s not actually clear what his duties as foreign policy adviser entailed on a day-to-day basis. But his guilty plea is, nonetheless, hugely significant. It shows that while the flashy work is targeting people like Manafort — there had long been public indication that he was a target — the Mueller team is making serious behind-the-scenes moves that we may not often be aware of. The charges against Papadopoulos go back to this January, when he was interviewed by the FBI about his conversations with Russians during the campaign. Papadopoulos had in fact worked with multiple individuals claiming to be able to connect him with the Russian government — one of whom, called “the Professor” in the indictment, promised to get “thousands” of Clinton emails acquired by Russia into the Trump campaign’s hands. Papadopoulos didn’t tell the FBI any of this, and instead chose to lie to its investigators — which is a felony. The Mueller team put together proof that he lied as the year progressed, quietly arresting him on July 27. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty on October 5, but the plea wasn’t unsealed until October 30. Those precise dates are crucial. During that July 27 to October 30 time frame, there had been little public indication that Papadopoulos had been scooped up. This appears to be because Papadopoulos was needed as a state’s witness: The government’s motion to seal his guilty plea described him as a “proactive cooperator,” a legal term suggesting he was actively assisting in some fashion with Mueller’s probe, and that revealing his plea “may alert other subjects to the direction and status of the investigation.” Papadopoulos was, in the mob investigation analogy, wearing a wire for the past several months. In fact, it’s possible he was literally wearing a wire; that’s something that “proactive cooperators” occasionally do, according to one former prosecutor interviewed by the Toronto Star’s Daniel Dale. And what’s more, it appears to have yielded real and valuable information. The indictment against Papadopoulos contains previously unknown examples of him talking about contacts with the Russians with a number of different unnamed Trump associates — including a “Senior Policy Advisor,” “Campaign Supervisor,” and “High-Ranking Campaign Official.” Who this implicates is yet to be revealed, but it’s clear that Mueller is interested in going after more Trump people. Papadopoulos’s quiet cooperation, in short, appears to have helped put a series of Trump officials in the crosshairs on Russia-related stuff. “They are going to be under more scrutiny,” Wright says, “and have probably [already] been the subject of interviews of Papadopoulos.” There are obviously a huge number of different places the Mueller investigation could go from here. But the Manafort and Papadopoulos cases suggest that targeting individuals and getting them to flip is going to be a key tactic going forward — and no one is more obviously vulnerable than Michael Flynn. “It is a bad sign for Flynn,” Goodman says of today’s news. Flynn’s alleged sins are similar to both Manafort’s and Papadopoulos’s. Like Manafort, he failed to fully disclose lobbying done on behalf of a foreign government (Turkey, specifically) last year. Though Flynn filed FARA paperwork retroactively announcing this work earlier this year, it’s not clear if that was complete or enough to protect him from charges. What’s more, Flynn also took $45,000 from the Russian government in 2015 to appear at a dinner with Putin, but appears to have claimed that the money came from “US companies” on a security clearance form — which would constitute lying to federal investigators under US law. The fact that Mueller’s team has already deployed both of these charges, unregistered lobbying and lying to federal investigators, means that Flynn is likely to face seriously scrutiny. “[Mueller] is taking substantive FARA violations very seriously and they’re taking false statements to FBI agents very seriously,” Wright says. What’s more, Flynn is someone whom Mueller would almost certainly love to flip. Multiple reports from inside the Trump camp say that he and the president were personally close; Trump has tweeted support for Flynn repeatedly even after firing him from his post as national security adviser. Flynn also has longstanding ties to the Russian government; he was a regular on Russia Today, the country’s English-language propaganda outlet, for a long time. Flynn’s own actions both render him vulnerable to the kind of pressure Mueller wants to use and mark him as someone who could very well have known about any collusion between Trump and Russia.

        "articles": "Trump is claiming vindication. The truth is more complicated. On January 3, the Washington Post’s Amy Gardner broke the news that, in an hourlong recorded phone call, President Donald Trump repeatedly pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to somehow change the results in the state to deliver him a victory. The Post published the full audio and transcript of that call, and it received enormous media attention. Six days later, in the wake of the storming of the Capitol, Gardner broke a follow-up story revealing that Trump had a similar phone call with another Georgia official, Raffensperger’s lead investigator Frances Watson. This time around, there was no audio or transcript of that call available, so Gardner’s story was attributed to an an anonymous state official. The official claimed that, on the call, Trump said Watson should “find the fraud” and could become a “national hero” by doing so. But according to a newly surfaced recording of the call with Watson, Trump did not in fact use those exact words. He did say she could find “dishonesty” in Fulton County, and that “when the right answer comes out, you’ll be praised.” But the language of the quotes the Post attributed to Trump were not accurate. As a result, the Post had to run a prominent correction. Trump and conservatives are now scorning the paper, and even some mainstream reporters are looking askance and wondering how it happened. The correction was merited — it’s important for reporters (and their sources) to be careful in attributing exact language in quotes. And it is unfortunate that these incorrect quotes spread so widely. ( also wrote about the Post story in an article that has now been corrected.) However, Trump has used the correction to claim in a statement that “the original story was a Hoax, right from the very beginning,” which is untrue. The original story that got so much attention was Trump’s call with Raffensperger, for which we had the full and accurate transcript all along. It has not been corrected. Furthermore, it remains the case that Trump did in fact call Watson to insist he won the state and that she should turn up evidence revealing fraud. “The country is counting on it,” he said. Overall, the Post’s correction changes what we know about the exact words Trump said to Watson, but it doesn’t fundamentally change our understanding of what Trump was saying to Georgia state officials at the time. ’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. For a reporter trying to reconstruct a phone call that happened behind closed doors, there’s nothing more valuable than a recording. And for Trump’s call with Brad Raffensperger, such a recording was made and provided to the Washington Post. We could listen to Trump’s exact words and understand their full context. It was the gold standard of evidence. “I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state,” Trump told Raffensperger. Claiming that “totally illegal” fraud occurred, Trump told Raffensperger, “You can’t let that happen, that’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer.” If however a call was not recorded, the reporter must rely on either notes provided by a source, or the memories of a source, to reconstruct what happened. And given the vagaries of human memory, that’s where things can get a bit fuzzy. Per the Post, this is the chain of events that led to now-corrected story on the Trump call with Georgia official Frances Watson: Importantly, it doesn’t seem likely that there was malice in the misquotes. The emergence of the recording (first released by the Wall Street Journal) does not get Trump off the hook. Trump is still inappropriately pressuring state officials to come up with findings that will swing Georgia’s result in his favor. And the accurate quotes don’t have a significantly different upshot. (If they had been simply paraphrased rather than in quotation marks, there would likely be no objection to them.) What seems to have happened is that either Watson or Fuchs was a bit sloppy in what was an exact quote vs. a paraphrase, because they didn’t have the audio handy or strong notes. The two differences that merited the correction were as follows. First, the Post originally claimed Trump told Watson to “find the fraud.” What he actually said was: “If you can get to Fulton, you’re gonna find things that are gonna be unbelievable, the dishonesty that — that we’ve heard from — just good sources, really good sources. But Fulton is the motherlode you know as the expression goes, Fulton County ... They dropped ballots. They dropped all these ballots. Stacey Abrams, really terrible. just a terrible thing.” So obviously Trump was telling Watson that fraud occurred and that she could “find” supposed evidence of it in Fulton County, but he did not use the exact phrase “find the fraud.” Second, the Post originally claimed Trump said Watson would be “a national hero.” He did not say those words, but said (amidst incoherent and difficult-to-follow rambling) that her job was “the most important” in the country and that when the “right answer” comes out “you’ll be praised”: It’s so important what you’re doing ... It’s just, you have the most important job in the country right now ... When the right answer comes out, you’ll be praised! I don’t know why —they made it so hard — they will be praised, people will say “great!” ... Whatever you can do, Frances. It’s a great thing. It’s an important thing for the country. So important. You have no idea, it’s so important. Again, if a journalism outlet uses quotation marks, it’s important to get those quotes exactly right. Fallibilities of human memory make attribution of exact quotes without rock-solid evidence an inherently tricky business, though. One wonders how many quotes in other major media stories or books would have to be corrected if audio recordings of their exact language emerged. What the new recording does not do is present a substantively different picture of what Trump was up to on that call than the Post’s original story. Trump, though, is savvy about the fact that most people will only vaguely remember the details, will mix the Raffensperger and Watson calls up, and will see reports of a correction regarding Trump’s Georgia phone call. Those sympathetic to Trump or skeptical of the media will wonder if he got a bad rap regarding that larger story. He did not.

        "articles": "In February 2012, Mitt Romney told CNN he's \"not concerned about the very poor.\" But the 2015 edition of Romney \"wants to make tackling poverty … one of the three pillars of his campaign.\" Jeb Bush is framing his 2016 campaign around social mobility, naming both his PACs \"Right to Rise.\" And at its summit this week, Heritage Action left the red meat of Obamacare and Obamnesty off the agenda in favor of repositioning conservatives. Heritage president Jim DeMint said conservatives are \"the real progressives in Washington ... fighting against the status quo\" and \"showing Americans how we can progress to a better future.\" While the policies haven't shifted much, the rhetoric has, with talk of those left behind in recent years a far cry from the business owner triumphalism on display at a 2012 GOP convention that at times seemed monolithically focused on exploiting Barack Obama's alleged \"you didn't build that\" gaffe. Today's Republican — even when they're literally the same people as the ones who ran a few years ago — arguably sound more like Elizabeth Warren, offering an outsider critique of an economic status quo. And that's no coincidence. Michael Grunwald trolled the reading public with a Christmas Eve Politico Magazine story arguing that \"everything is awesome\" in America this winter. It's obviously an overstatement, but it reflects the very accurate reality that after years of grindingly slow economic recovery, things are picking up. We've seen accelerating job growth, cheap gas, and GDP numbers with some real bounce. Whatever you want to say about the economy today, it is a lot better than the economy of two or three or four years ago. You've seen that reflected in the Obama administration's rhetoric, and you're certain to see it on full display in the State of the Union address later this month. The conservative site Newsbusters deemed the piece outrageous and Elizabeth Warren framed her most recent major policy address as a critique of its thesis. Structurally speaking, the two main out groups in American politics today - the left wing of the Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Republican Party - are facing a common problem. After years of intense crisis, things are clearly getting better. That leaves them pivoting toward the same thing: the short-comings of the recovery - a lack of opportunity at the bottom or the rise of inequality at the top. But an intra-party fight for the ideological future is very different from a presidential campaign against an incumbent party. There's good reason to believe that rhetoric that makes sense for the Warren Wing Democrats is a dead-end for DeMint and his fellow conservatives. It makes sense that left and right are converging on this narrative, but that doesn't make it a winning strategy. Lynn Vavreck's book, The Message Matters, is by far the best analysis of the interplay between campaign messages and economic fundamentals. In her terms, 2012 was a classic mixed-economy scenario in which both sides — rightly — did their best to argue their case about the merits of Obama's economic stewardship. But if the recovery really does continue strengthening, forcing Republicans to pursue what Vavreck calls an \"insurgent\" campaign strategy, harping on the poor is unlikely to work. An insurgent's task has three steps: The poverty and opportunity frames may work for Warren's intra-party factional fight, but they essentially fail for Republicans on all three fronts. They don't really change the conversation from the economy, it cuts against the existing Republican brand, and it doesn't tie in to any notably popular Republican policy positions. The greatest recent example of a successful insurgent is George W. Bush's 2000 campaign, which shows both where the GOP-Warren mind-meld goes wrong and also simply how hard it is to get this right. Faced with the strong economic climate of the late 1990s, Bush employed several strategies. One, he distanced Al Gore from economic success, emphasizing divided government and the large role of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan who he promised to keep on. Then he changed the subject to a completely different set of issues — restoring \"honor and dignity to the White House,\" military preparedness, and management of K-12 schools. His agenda for steep tax cuts was framed as a common sense corrective to budget surpluses rather than an economic growth model. It was clever and it worked. Sort of. Bush, famously, received fewer votes than his opponent even though Gore simultaneously had to fend off a Ralph Nader campaign to his left. And he benefitted from the fact that even though the media didn't really recognize it at the time, the economy was already slowing by late 1999. All of which is to say that it's objectively hard to beat the incumbents when things are going well. The good news for Republicans is that the signs of recovery — though real — are still somewhat preliminary and it's a long way from November 2016. There's plenty of time for things to take another turn for the worse. But if they don't, trying to sell themselves as the real progressives on economics isn't an especially promising means of coping.

        "articles": "Robert Reich isn't naive about changing America's political system, and he's no conspiracy theorist about Hillary Clinton. Now a public policy professor at the University of California Berkeley, Reich worked with Clinton in college, was close friends with Bill Clinton at Oxford, and served as secretary of labor during Clinton's first term. He's also become Bernie Sanders's most persuasive — and, through his Facebook videos, viral — surrogate. Reich isn't a Bernie-or-bust type. Hillary Clinton, he says, is the best possible president for running the system we have. But Sanders, he argues, is the only presidential candidate actually trying to change the system we have into the system we deserve. Reich thinks that our old models for understanding politics have been broken by rising inequality over the past few decades, and that we first need to tackle that crisis head on before we can even get to questions of policy. I recently interviewed Reich for my podcast (you can listen to it here or subscribe on iTunes), and I think it's worth paying attention to why he thinks Sanders is the necessary solution — even if you prefer Clinton. Here's Reich: It's not enough to talk about good policy. Policy is cheap — at least, policy discussion is cheap. I'm as much of a policy wonk as anybody; I've been teaching public policy for 40 years. But it's becoming increasingly irrelevant, because without political will and political power — and a movement behind that political will and power — no policy is going to be put into effect. If you came to the political understanding in the '60s or '70s or '80s ... the assumption was that politics was laid out on a long continuum from left to right. Democrats were on the left, Republicans were on the right, and the center was the center — and you wanted to go to the center, because that's where all the votes were. That was the way we thought about politics, but that left out some very important phenomena that have occurred over the last several decades. What it leaves out is this widening inequality — it's not just economic, it's also political, and it has to do with political power. The vast majority of Americans, according to almost every study on this issue, feel a high degree of powerlessness. They just feel like they don't have any say, any control. ... The left-right continuum is beside the point. The real interesting divide is establishment versus anti-establishment: Do you feel the game is against you? Or are you among the riggers of the game? Even if you don't agree with Reich's thoughts on the race, I think you'll find our 100-minute interview worthwhile. Reich has a stunningly impressive CV — Rhodes scholar, assistant to US Solicitor General Robert Bork, director of policy planning at the Federal Trade Commission under President Jimmy Carter, co-founder of the American Prospect — and we had no shortage of things to discuss. Among the other topics Reich and I touched on: For more podcast conversations — including episodes with Rachel Maddow, Bill Gates, World Bank President Dr. Jim Yong Kim, and conservative activist Michael Needham — subscribe to The Ezra Klein Show.

        "articles": "The Pew Center has a genuinely amazing set of interactive charts and graphs up on America's shifting demographics. It's just fantastic work. But if you manage to tear yourself away from the data visualizations, you'll see some slightly odd editorializing in the text. \"At a time when young and old don't look alike, think alike or vote alike, how will America modernize its entitlement programs so they're in sync with its new demographics?\" they ask. Another section strongly implies that Social Security cuts are needed: \"we'll have just two workers per beneficiary — down from three-to-one now, five-to-one in 1960 and more than forty-to-one in 1945, shortly after Social Security first started supporting beneficiaries\" so today's people \"have no realistic chance of receiving [full Social Security benefits] when they become old.\" The striking thing is that Pew's data is so good that it thoroughly debunks this portrait of a country riven by generational conflict. It is true that younger Americans and older Americans have very different political views, but few people perceive American politics as driven by age-related conflicts: Source: Pew Center According to Pew, most Americans see a significant conflict between rich and poor and most don't see a significant conflict between young and old. One reason is that though young people and old people disagree about many things, they don't disagree about retirement programs: Source: Pew Center That, again, is not to deny that the young and the old have different political opinions. As Pew writes, the youngest cohort \"hold liberal attitudes on most social and governmental issues, as well as America's approach to foreign policy\" and in particular millennials \"are strong supporters of a more activist government.\" All of which is to say that the generation gap in American politics isn't about age per se, and it certainly isn't about retirement programs. It's about class. Congress is sharply divided between a party that's obsessed with raising taxes on the rich and a party that's fanatically opposed to doing so. Young people largely back the Democrats on this, while old people largely back the GOP. But there simply isn't a scramble between young and old for resources.

        "articles": "Outside contributors' opinions and analysis of the most important issues in politics, science, and culture. Politically speaking, there was no debate on United States international trade agreements in 2016: All politicians seeking to win a national election, or even to create a party-spanning political coalition, agree that our trade agreements are bad things. From the left, we had Democratic presidential primary runner-up Bernie Sanders — and a remarkably close runner-up he was — slamming trade. From the — I do not think it’s wrong but it’s not quite correct to call it “right,” at least not as Americans have hitherto understood what “right” is — but from somewhere, we had now-President Donald Trump. Listen to them: The rhetoric is the same. It goes like this: The jobs America wants to have — the good jobs, the manufacturing jobs — have gone. First came NAFTA, in 1993. Then there was China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which granted China a normal country's freedom to export to other countries, and obligations to accept imports from other countries. Finally, there was the not-yet-implemented (and, as of this week, officially dead) Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Such agreements will leave, or have left, \"millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache” (Trump), have \"lost [us] … manufacturing jobs” (Trump), and created “catastrophe” (Trump). The agreements amount to \"the death blow for American manufacturing” (Sanders), they “undermine our independence” (Trump), and they \"forced American workers to compete against desperate and low-wage labor around the world” (Sanders), all while causing \"massive job losses in the United States and the shutting down of tens of thousands of factories” (Sanders). And what did we hear from the center establishment? We had popular vote–winning (but Electoral College–losing) Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. She stated: “I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I’ll oppose it after the election, and I’ll oppose it as president. …” The rhetoric of all three candidates resonates with the criticism of trade agreements that we heard way back when NAFTA was on the table as a proposal — not, as today, something to blame all our current economic woes on. The independent Ross Perot and Republican insurgent Pat Buchanan claimed NAFTA would produce \"a giant sucking sound [of jobs] going south” (Perot), that we’ve “wrecked the country with these kinds of deals” (Perot), that the deal added up to “anti-freedom, 1,200 pages of rules, regulations, laws, fines, commissions — plus side agreements — setting up no fewer than 49 new bureaucracies” (Buchanan). The political truthiness has been flying thick and fast on this subject for decades now. Politicians are taking claims that have a very tenuous connection to economic reality — claims that feel true — and running with them, sometimes out of ignorance, sometimes because of cynical calculation. Clinton was clearly the candidate whose policy claims, as a whole, had the best empirical support, so her surrender to truthy proclamations about trade was especially galling. Her advisers and experts, I am certain, did not believe the TPP would kill jobs or hold down wages, although they may have been aware of some of the technocratic economic complaints about the TPP. Those complaints, with which I sympathize, were twofold. First, that the TPP would have given US owners of intellectual property too much of a whip hand in their extraction of economic rents from people in poorer countries. It would have made them pay through the nose for research and development that had already been done, and had already been paid for out of profits earned in the US. Second, it set in stone rules for judging whether governments were treating companies fairly. We do want a trading system in which companies exporting and investing have confidence that they will not be specifically discriminated against by governments, but the form such rules should take are very delicate. It’s not wise to set them in stone before we see how they work. The general agreement among those who analyzed the TPP, however, was that it was on the whole very profitable for the US: Yes, it made poor foreigners pay through the nose for intellectual property. But it was definitely not a job killer for the US, or a wage suppressor. And insofar as those who profited from the TPP then turned around and employed workers in the US, which to a great extent they would have, it would have been a wage and job booster. But for the purposes of the HRC campaign, a job killer and a wage suppressor it had to be. And so it became. But the truthiness on the subject of trade agreements was flying even thicker and faster from the others, from Sanders last spring, from Trump — and, again, earlier, from Perot and Buchanan. Yes, America has been losing manufacturing job share at a furious rate. Yes, the spread between the incomes of the non-college-educated and the college-educated has widened massively. Yes, the spread between the incomes of even the college-educated and our overclass has exploded. But this is not due to NAFTA. This is not due to bringing China into the WTO rather than keeping it out. This is not due to the not-yet-completed — and now never-to-be-completed — TPP. Try to calculate the share that those three “bad trade agreements” played in the processes of manufacturing job loss, of widening income inequality, and the coming of the overclass of the Second Gilded Age, and — as long as you calculate honestly — you get a share of responsibility of less than 5 percent, and usually less than 1 percent. This is what caused a populist backlash? To be clear, I do think American international economic policy has been far, far from perfect. I could rant with the best of them about our failure to be a capital-exporting nation financing the industrialization of the world, a role from which we would ultimately benefit both economically and politically. I can rant about our reluctance to properly incentivize the creation and maintenance of the global treasures that are our communities of engineering practice. It is no accident that spinning machines were made in Lowell, Massachusetts; that automobiles were made in Detroit; minicomputers were made along Route 128, Massachusetts; that programs are written in Silicon Valley; and that hoverboards are made in Shenzhen, China. A community of engineers, technicians, and businesses that have seen the problems and methods of an industry up close and who know how to solve them is an incredibly valuable and difficult-to-create economic resource. We should not “protect” such communities regardless of cost, but we should nurture them. I also believe that a rich country like the US should be saving more than it invests here at home: It is poor countries that need to invest more than they save. And the US should be taking that extra savings — the part that’s in excess over investment — and lending it out in dollars to poor countries where capital is scarce. Those countries should then be taking those dollars and using them to buy the capital goods from us that they need to equip their workers. They would be buying those machines from firms embedded in our communities of engineering practice, thereby profiting US companies. The US should be running not a trade deficit but a trade surplus, as do the other two leading industrial powers, Japan and Germany. And to the extent that American workers share in the surplus created by healthy communities of engineering practice — which they always have, to a significant extent — this is good not just for the world economy as a whole but for US workers too. And in order to run that trade surplus, the US should be facilitating manufacturing production and exports by following not a strong-dollar policy but an appropriate-dollar policy. A strong dollar is not in America’s interest if it means market prices are sending the wrong signals. An overly strong dollar tells engineering-based manufacturing and other industries that they are not useful to society. It signals to businesses that they should disrupt these communities and outsource more of their work. And that does serious damage. So yes, I acknowledge US economic policy has been far from perfect. It has been far from perfect over the past 40 years in its macroeconomic stance — the Reagan and George W. Bush tax cuts, the belief that less regulation of finance in New York is always good, the belief that the value of the dollar is how we keep score. But the never-to-be-implemented TPP? NAFTA? And China-WTO? They are not big parts of any picture. They are not a big part of the long-run decline in the manufacturing job share. Indeed, they barely register among the flaws in US international economic policy. By and large, the jobs that we shed as a result of NAFTA and China-WTO were low-paying jobs that we did not really want. Because of NAFTA and China-WTO, we have been able to buy a lot of good stuff much cheaper — which means we have had more income to spend on other things and to pay people to do other, more useful things than work on low-productivity blue-collar assembly lines. Skeptical? I understand. But leave me space to make my argument, and I will return to this point later. We have not done our proper job in cushioning the incomes of and providing opportunities to those people and communities that have found themselves behind the eight-ball, in sectors flooded by imports as other countries industrialize (especially China). But NAFTA and China-WTO look, to me, like things that have been broadly good for the American economy. And they have been even better for America as the world's dominant superpower. A Mexico that is helped by the United States makes life here more comfortable than a deeply impoverished Mexico. China is likely to be co-equal with the US as a superpower by the end of this century; enmeshing it in our economy starting now is the best move in a long-term plan to make that equality one of partnership and alliance rather than competition and cold war. But I digress. Back to my main thread: Why do I think that what I say is the economic policy truth is in fact the truth? Here is the story as I see it: The elephant in the room is the collapse over the past three generations of the manufacturing employment share here in America. A manufacturing job making things in a factory is no longer, in any sense, a typical job for Americans. A sector of the economy that provided three out of 10 nonfarm jobs at the start of the 1950s and one in four nonfarm jobs at the start of the 1970s now provides fewer than one in 11 nonfarm jobs today. Proportionally, the United States has shed almost two-thirds of relative manufacturing employment since 1971: I am at heart an economic historian. So stepping back to place our current political-economic debate over trade policy in a two-thirds century perspective is not enough for me. I want to go back 100 times as far: back to the invention of agriculture. From that super-long-run perspective, the past two-thirds of a century's relative shift of jobs out of what we call manufacturing — a word that in its origins is Latin for \"making things with our hands\" — is just the latest of a number of shifts that have taken place. In each case, advancing technology enabled us to make vital things with less human time and energy; demand for those vital things by those with money to spend did not expand enough to preserve all the jobs. Now, for the past two-thirds of a century, it has been the turn of blue-collar manufacturing jobs to vanish. To be the beneficiaries of such a process is a very good thing: Lots more good stuff becomes available at a cheaper price. The $100 billion 1960-purchasing-power dollars we spent on food in 1960, for example, amounted to 20 percent of everything the US made. The $1.5 trillion of 2016-purchasing-power dollars we spend on food today is only 8 percent of everything we make. And more than $300 billion of our annual food budget today is for food processing that is paid for today but that was done unpaid by wives, mothers, sisters, and daughters back in 1960. To be caught up as a victim of such a process of displacement — to be a farmer who loses his job because the economy is getting more efficient at producing food — is a bad thing. It’s not just that you need to find another job. It’s that you need to find another kind of job. You may well not be prepared or equipped for it. And it changes who you are. And that is if you can find another job The research suggests, however, that when the economy is doing well — a key point — and the plant you work in shuts down, you do, indeed, take a hit, but it is not necessarily a staggering hit. Your income over the next 20 years turns out to be about 10 percent lower than the income of similarly situated people who are not caught in a mass layoff. You don’t, as a rule, permanently go from a $35-an-hour manufacturing job to a $9-an-hour McDonald’s job. In short, those whose jobs vanish usually find something else to do that does not involve too much downward mobility, whether in income or status. And the benefits of cheap goods are, usually, not overly concentrated among the already rich. All Americans benefit from inexpensive food, after all, and inexpensive TVs and other goods. And the process could always be made win-win for everybody. We can, collectively, at least in theory, have everything we had before, plus more. Figuring out how to distribute the fruits of the useful work we do in an equitable manner is a problem of societal organization that ought not to be beyond our abilities to solve. However, a lot of work must be done here by the word \"could\" in the previous paragraph, and by the concept of \"net” benefits. Nevertheless, in American politics in 2016, the talk is not about how to better manage a generations-long process of structural economic transformation. In American politics in 2016, the talk is instead truthy talk about the villainy of NAFTA in 1993, the offense of China joining the WTO in 2001, and the theoretical disaster of TPP. Have trade agreements driven this process of shedding manufacturing jobs in America? And would abrogating NAFTA, withdrawing from the WTO, and not ratifying the TPP be appropriate and sufficient policy responses to the shedding of manufacturing jobs? The clear and obvious answer is: no. Consider a country that has, everyone agrees, done everything right as far as nurturing its manufacturing sector is concerned: Germany. High national savings lent abroad, which provides foreigners with the deutsch marks (and now euros) to purchase German manufactures? Check. Eschewing a strong-deutsch-mark (now euro) policy to make its goods affordable? Check. Nurturing communities of engineering expertise through heavily subsidized apprenticeship and technical training programs? Check. Germany today is the manufacturing export powerhouse of the world. Yet here’s the share of German employment in manufacturing since 1971: Now you can say — correctly and truly — that one-third of that shedding by Germany of its manufacturing job share is a special case: It took place in the first half of the 1990s, when the German East was absorbed and Germany was unified: That unification era saw an enormous one-time structural change, as the inefficient low-wage, low-productivity jobs of the communist factories of East Germany proved uncompetitive on the world market. Factories shut, shedding workers and releasing them for other, more societally productive uses elsewhere in the economy. Before the Berlin Wall came down, East Germany’s manufacturing was heavily protected by the tariff barriers thrown up by Russia's counterpart to the European Union free trade zone, COMECON. It was further protected by the barriers thrown up by East Germany's communist centrally planned allocation economy: Even if it were cheaper to buy manufactured goods outside of East Germany, you could do so only if the planners allowed it (and they would not). When those artificial supports for bad businesses disappeared, did East Germany's workers move on to more productive work? Yes, most of them did. Many moved to West Germany and its more robust economy. Some, however, did not. And enough wound up on the dole that the sociological aftershocks are still being felt today: Even 25 years later, unemployment in the former East Germany is 3 percentage points higher than unemployment in the former West Germany. But consider this too: An East Germany that was only 40 percent as well off as West Germany in 1989 is now 80 percent as well off as West Germany. It is very hard to say that the shedding of inefficient, unproductive, and low-wage manufacturing jobs was a minus for East Germans. Back to the US: In 1953, lower productivity (compared with today) meant that many more workers were needed to make each car, each refrigerator, each chair. That kept US manufacturing large in terms of employment. Tariff barriers and high transportation and distribution costs, relative to today, meant that there were very few opportunities for American firms to offshore manufacturing in an efficient way. Just as in Germany after 1989, the overwhelming bulk of the shedding of the US manufacturing share of employment since the 1950s is the result of two things: 1. Rising productivity in the face of limited demand: Nobody needs two dining room tables — which now take fewer workers to create — and even though my wife and I find that we \"need\" two refrigerators, we are weird. This is big. 2. Reductions in transportation costs that allow producers elsewhere that used to be unable to serve the US market to do so. (Reductions in government-imposed tariff and non-tariff barriers play a very soft second fiddle here.) Those foreign producers then use the dollars they earn to buy other US made products produced in other sectors of manufacturing, or in services. This is, compared with the first factor, small. Over all, the shedding of shop-floor jobs that results from those two trends is a good thing. But how much of a role in “bad” job shedding did NAFTA and China joining the WTO play? And how to distinguish between “good” and “bad” shedding? One possible baseline, given how many people hold up Germany as a model for the way it has protected its manufacturing, is to assume that under the best policies, the US would have matched Germany. It would have shed about 50 percent of its manufacturing job share since 1971, rather than the 62 percent that we did shed. That would have given the US today manufacturing employment equal to 12.2 percent rather than 8.6 percent of nonfarm employment. That represents a gap between reality and one theoretical alternative world of 5.4 million manufacturing jobs. Call that the excess shrinkage of US manufacturing. I am probably an outlier among neoliberal and neoclassical economists in thinking that most of that shedding — US job shedding that exceeded German job shedding — was bad. (Others believe that it was efficient.) Remember: I believe that under proper economic policies, the US should be saving more than it is investing at home and so helping finance the development of the rest of the world, that it should eschew the strong dollar, and should do more to nurture and support its incredibly valuable communities of engineering practice. And pursuing such goals would have kept the manufacturing job share higher than some neoliberals believe ideal. But such policies would not have kept the manufacturing job share at the 24 percent of 1971, or the 30 percent of 1950. But 12.2 percent seems to me something that could have been attained in a different world — one without the Reagan and W tax cuts, without the consequent Reagan and W Bush budget deficits, one without the overlong strong-dollar policy and the encouragement of excessive financialization of the economy, and one with proper attention to how manufacturing (and engineering, and design) matters. That different world would be a better one. But how much of that gap between American and German performance was caused by NAFTA? Recall that the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement: Back in 1992, when Republican George H.W. Bush was negotiating NAFTA, Ross Perot claimed that NAFTA would lead to a \"giant sucking sound\" as businesses moved huge numbers of jobs from the US to Mexico. But did NAFTA drive any rise in the unemployment rate? No. The years after NAFTA's implementation were the best as far as unemployment is concerned of any since the early 1970s. Did NAFTA drive the fall in the manufacturing employment share? No. Before NAFTA was signed, we were already five-sevenths of the way from July 1953 to our present state in terms of “losing” manufacturing jobs. We were three-fifths of the way from January 1971 to our present state. Even the best policies favorable to nurturing a country's manufacturing sector would not have prevented this process of the shedding of relatively inefficient manufacturing jobs. The trend preceded NAFTA, and it would have continued with or without NAFTA. Even the work of anti-NAFTA economists demonstrates this. The most thoughtful and careful think tank that is skeptical of globalization is Larry Mishel's Economic Policy Institute. Its estimates are the most aggressive credible ones of deleterious effects of NAFTA. Writing for EPI, Robert Scott ascribes the shedding of 420,000 manufacturing jobs to the growth of trade with Mexico since the passage of NAFTA. As best as I can figure out from the more detailed numbers he provides, his estimates imply that manufacturing industries in which we are net exporters to Mexico gained about 300,000 jobs, and manufacturing industries in which we are not importers from Mexico lost about 700,000 jobs. That would imply a net loss of 400,000 jobs. But in Scott's view, roughly 300,000 of the manufacturing jobs displaced by the pattern of growing trade with Mexico are not net reductions in total US jobs. They are, rather, shifts in net jobs from manufacturing to other sectors. In normal times, the Federal Reserve responds to overall employment declines by cutting interest rates to boost employment in other sectors, and thus the job displacement in traded goods is roughly offset by job growth elsewhere in the economy. Scott suggests that the Fed did this job reasonably well at least until 2007, by which point, because of the financial crisis, it had lowered interest rates as far as they could go; after 2007, it could offer no useful stimulus. In the end, in Scott's view, there remain \"116,400 US jobs displaced ... between 2007 and 2010... [which are] net job losses for the entire economy.\" In other words, in a world without NAFTA there would have been 116,400 more available positions in 2010. 116,400 jobs amounts to less than 0.1 percent of the US labor force. Particular industries were supposed to have been placed under dire threat by competition from Mexico, most especially autos and auto parts. Both Ross Perot and his sometime-adviser Harley Shaiken, a Berkeley colleague of mine, put the auto industry at the top of their “endangered jobs” lists. Mexico, they said, had high-quality workers earning low wages in auto assembly plants, and the US simply would not be able to compete. But in the three years after NAFTA was implemented, employment in the American automotive industry grew by 14.1 percent, worker hourly earnings grew by 5.6 percent, and Ford, Chrysler, and GM invested $39.1 billion in new manufacturing plants and equipment in the US — and only $3 billion in Mexico. What seems to have happened is that the North American auto industry reacted to NAFTA by rationalizing itself — moving those parts of it that could be effectively performed by relatively low-skill workers to Mexico, and thus gaining a cost advantage vis-à-vis European and Japanese producers. As the trade economist Sherman Robinson and his co-authors wrote, there was: a dramatic increase in [North American] intra-industry trade in autos and parts.... [Economic] efficiency gains from finer specialization... [that] do not appear to be “Ricardian,” in that they are not primarily based on... [exploiting low wages] but “Smithian” in the sense that NAFTA widened the extent of the market and permitted increasing returns to finer specialization. Most fears about the ill effects of NAFTA on the U.S. auto industry, whether in term of employment, wages, or investment, have been proven wrong... And do note that trade with Mexico would have grown and grown in a similar pattern without NAFTA — merely to a slightly lesser extent. I believe Scott is aware of this overarching trend: His report is subtitled “US-Mexico Trade and Job Displacement after NAFTA,” rather than something like \"Trade and Job Displacement because of NAFTA.” Thus the high-end credible estimate is that NAFTA produced a shedding of 200,000 manufacturing jobs. That represents: In the context of all the forces and disruptions affecting the US economy and the US distribution of income and wealth over the past half-century, NAFTA was and is simply not a very big deal. And there are important benefits from NAFTA. The higher real incomes we get from having Mexico as a more prosperous trading partner — because our dollars buy more goods, since those goods are cheaper — make up one set of benefits. Other sets of benefits are at least as important. The biggest of them is that we need to do what we can to make a peaceful world. It is part of the US’s job as a superpower to extend a helping hand so that Mexico can become richer faster. A world in which schoolchildren in the future are taught — truly — that America did all it could to close off economic opportunities to others and keep them poor and barefoot is unlikely to be a safe world for Americans. And it makes us into a worse America as well. In the decade from 1991 to 2001, the year China joined the WTO, the Chinese economy sat up: US imports from China increased from $20 billion at 2007 prices — 0.6 percent of the market in the US for manufactured goods — to $120 billion, 2.3 percent of the market. And then in the half-decade from 2001 to 2007, the Chinese economy stood up: US imports of Chinese goods surged from $120 to $320 billion at 2007 prices — from 2.4 percent to 5.8 percent of the US manufactured goods market. This is, potentially, a bigger deal than NAFTA occurring in a shorter time: three times as large an increase in manufactured goods imports as in Mexico in less than half the time. This is the \"China shock.\" The MIT economist Daron Acemoglu and his colleagues attribute the loss of 560,000 American jobs to the China shock. Once again, the pre-2008 shedding of manufacturing jobs is overwhelmingly a job shift rather than a job loss. The people who lose jobs in import-competing manufacturing and leave the sector for the most part found jobs elsewhere — in services, in construction, and so forth. The Federal Reserve was trying to, and largely succeeding at, nailing the unemployment rate to 5 percent, its estimate of what the American economy could sustain without causing undue inflation. It was not until 2008 the Federal Reserve was tapped out, in the sense that it was unable or unwilling to adopt policies that it expected to return the economy to full employment within a couple of years. So as far as net job losses are concerned — as opposed to the redistribution of jobs — we are talking about what has happened since 2008. Once again, remember that manufactured goods imports from China would have surged substantially even had China not joined the WTO — the development that Donald Trump claims \"enabled the greatest jobs theft in history.\" Even a China that had not joined the WTO would have industrialized, and exported. Therefore, I think it is not unreasonable to take the true numbers to be half those of Acemoglu et al. Halving his figures, we find that because China joined the WTO, the US has 200,000 more jobs in manufacturing industries that export to China, and 500,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in industries where China exports to the US. The net loss is 300,000. That represents 0.22 percentage points of nonfarm employment. That is one-sixteenth of the excess shedding —beyond what Germany experienced over the same period — of the manufacturing job share. That is one-eightieth of the total shedding of the manufacturing job share since 1971. Once again, not a big deal. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, it is now clear, will never happen. None of the geopolitical gains for which it was negotiated will come to pass. Nor will any job losses. Had TPP gone into effect, it would not have done nearly as much as NAFTA or China's accession to the WTO did to reduce the costs and frictions that other countries face when they ship their manufactured goods to the United States. What TPP would have done was: I was a weak TPP opponent: 1 and 4 seemed to me to be good things, 3 seemed to be a bad thing, and 2 was a good thing for US intellectual property owners but a bad thing from my perspective as a rootless global cosmopolite. The relative decline in employment in manufacturing since World War II is the biggest structural change, or evolution, to hit the American economy over the past half-century. Politicians, with their preference for truthiness over the facts, attribute roughly all the 22 percentage point decline since 1971 in the manufacturing employment share to NAFTA, to China's entry into the WTO, and to a few other scattered \"corporately backed unfettered free trade agreements.” But — I really would like to drive this home — the worrisome part from trade is not the decline in the manufacturing job share from 30 percent to 12.2 percent, but the \"excess\" decline from 12.2 percent to 8.6 percent. That worrisome part of the decline of the manufacturing job share is, roughly, only one-sixth of the total decline: 3.6 percentage points. And the amount of decline attributable to the two big bad trade agreements is only one-tenth of that: 0.36 percentage points. In sum, we can attribute a mere one-tenth of the excess reduction relative to Germany in the manufacturing job share to NAFTA and to China joining the WTO. Simply to no longer be working in manufacturing, or to not get your first job in manufacturing, or to not have the career in manufacturing you expected, is not by itself a bad thing. For many, the disappearance of blue-collar jobs is lived as being pulled out into a better alternative job rather than being pushed out into a worse one. Moreover, even if you keep your blue-collar manufacturing jobs, under what conditions do you keep them? Wage concessions under pressure from foreign competition have been a fact of blue-collar factory life in America since the coming of the Reagan tax cuts for the rich — since the era of budget deficits and the elevated dollar. In figuring out the economic effects on human beings of job shedding, economists Steven Davis and Till von Wächter, of Stanford and UCLA, are the go-to guys. They looked at firings as opposed to quits (since one reason you might quit is that your outside options are good), and mass layoffs rather than individual firings (for in mass layoffs there is surely no possibility that every worker affected is unusually unproductive). They find that if you lose your job in a mass layoff when the unemployment rate is less than 6 percent, your income over the next 20 years will be one-seventh lower than if you’d avoided getting caught up in the mass layoff. That's three years' worth of expected wages that you will lose over that period. In short, for the typical American, getting caught in economic destruction — creative or not — is a big and bad deal, if not a life-destroying one. It is right and normal that people should be  upset at getting caught up on the downside of the industrial evolution and structural transformation of the economy. And Americans have every right to demand that the government do something about it — not to freeze the relative distribution of jobs across sectors and industries at what it was in 1953 or 1971, but to make sure that those who lose out as a result of economic evolution and structural change are compensated reasonably. What form might this compensation take? It is the big missing ingredient in helping to “sell” and keep selling trade deals. But even thinking about this is hobbled by the fact that the response to such offers of compensation is often: We don't want “burial insurance.” People often don’t want compensation; they want things restored to the way they used to be. But it’s important to note just how crucial the overall macroeconomic context can be when it comes to job losses. What if you are fired in a mass layoff when the unemployment rate is more than 8 percent? Then your income over the next 20 years will fall by more than twice as much as it would have in a low-unemployment economy. Such workers will lose fully six years' worth of expected wages over that period. When unemployment is high, finding another job quickly is very difficult, and long periods in which you have not been working are taken — sometimes rightly, often wrongly — by employers as a sign that you are not a worker they want around. Thus, keeping the unemployment rate reliably below 6 percent and avoiding at all costs episodes in which the unemployment rate spikes above 8 percent would be a very effective trade adjustment policy. It’s one reason few people complained about NAFTA as its implementation took hold in the high-employment late 1990s. Unfortunately for those caught up in the general process of the shrinkage of manufacturing, most of the job losses took place in high-unemployment recession years. Shifting 22 percent of America's nonfarm labor force out of manufacturing, as has occurred since 1971, is not chopped liver: It has had major effects on American distribution and growth. For 22 percent of the labor force to lose an average of, say, five years' worth of income each is a huge deal. Saying that on net the process is a gain does not absolve anyone of being unprepared to figure out what are the appropriate policies to deal with it. But 98 percent of that shift would have occurred without the much-reviled trade agreements. And fortunately, the principal effects of NAFTA and China-WTO on American manufacturing took place in the boom years of the late 1990s and the not-totally-awful years of the mid-2000s. The 0.36 percent of the American labor force that was pushed out of manufacturing by NAFTA and China-WTO thus lost future income equal to perhaps four years' earnings. That’s the rough equivalent of 1.5 percent of one year’s national income. And those losses are, in simple arithmetic at least, almost surely offset by bigger gains to those who get to buy greater quantities of good imported stuff cheap. Measure this by the yardstick of the economic costs of what we used to think of as a \"normal\" business cycle recession, which would steal 12 percent of one year's American national income — eight times as much — from us. (And those costs have no upside, unlike trade deals.) Or measure it by the yardstick of the crisis produced by the crash of 2008 and what I am now calling the Longer Depression, which looks likely to rob the world of total wealth equal to 500 percent of one year's American national income, if not more. That’s hundreds of times more costly than the trade deals.. It is disturbing that the distributional consequences of the large decline in the manufacturing employment share are being hung on two trade agreements. And, as I have shown, that is utterly unjustified. As I hope I’ve made clear, I do not want to be read as saying that American trade policy has been perfect, or even particularly good. I could write an entire piece on what has been wrong with America's international economic policy. But NAFTA and China-WTO ain’t it. They are good trade deals. What has gone wrong has been our failure to assume our global responsibilities to be a capital-exporting nation that helps finance the industrialization of the rest of the world, our willingness to be a bolthole where foreign kleptocrats and others can store their money, our reluctance to properly incentivize the creation and maintenance of our communities of engineering practice, our willingness to use resources provided from abroad to finance consumption by our elite rather than investment in America, and our desire to charge poor people through the nose for access to what we deem \"our\" intellectual property. (TPP has, or would have had, a role in the last.) But how one should organize the global economy to properly nurture and develop communities of engineering practice and to move toward an efficient distribution of the work and a less unfair distribution of the wealth of the world economy — that is an argument for a different article. So let me break the fourth wall, and say that even though my work here as an economist is done, I find it vitally important that I ask all of you to try to answer a few political and psychological questions: I suspect this is a case of the populist impulse gone badly wrong. As a rule, it is remarkably hard in America to build any kind of governing or intellectually hegemonic coalition by treating other Americans as enemies. (As I write, Donald Trump and his Republican Party are probing the limits of this rule and whether the rule still holds.) This is a good thing about America. Most Americans, most of the time, regard almost all of the people who live here as their fellows, as co-participants in our common enterprise, our great contract between the dead, the living, and the unborn. We are, in the words of my remote ancestor John Winthrop aboard the Arbella in 1630, engaged in the utopian project of building a City Upon a Hill. And anyone who wants to come and join us and work for it is one of us. Most Americans. Most of the time. But — and this is a very important “but” — even here in America, you can, as you definitely can elsewhere, mobilize a great deal of populist energy by identifying foreigners as the enemy. I do not think this is an impulse that it is healthy for any part of this country. I do not think this is something any political movement that seeks to do anything other than destroy can dare to encourage. And I now find myself far beyond my competence. So I want to hear from historians, sociologists, political scientists, and cultural studies practitioners about why we have come to obsess about NAFTA, about not blocking China from joining the WTO, and about TPP. The economic case against the two agreements that passed, and the one that did not, doesn’t hold water. It’s clear, however, that candidates can make an effective political case against trade agreements — and that scares me.

        "articles": "Twitter users in Texas and Tennessee were particularly susceptible. Conservatives were much more likely than liberals to retweet Russian trolls in the 2016 election, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Southern California released this month. It traced Russian efforts to influence America’s 2016 presidential campaign via Twitter using 45 million election-related tweets generated by 5.7 million users in a one-month period ahead of the election; researchers delved into what information was spread by trolls, who spread it, and how many times those tweets were shared. The study focused on content from the 2,752 now-deactivated Russian troll accounts identified by Congress in November. The USC researchers found that conservatives retweeted Russian trolls about 31 times more often than liberals and produced 36 times more tweets. Most retweets of the trolls came from two specific states: Tennessee and Texas. Of the accounts analyzed, they estimated that 4.9 percent of liberal-leaning accounts that spread troll content were bots, and 6.2 percent of conservatives ones were bots. “Although an ideologically broad swath of Twitter users were exposed to Russian trolls in the period leading up to the 2016 US presidential election, it was mainly conservatives who helped amplify their message,” USC researchers Adam Badawy, Emilio Ferrara, and Kristina Lerman wrote. During the period they examined — September 16 to October 21, 2016 — the researchers found that trolls were producing more conservative content than liberals, but also that conservative users were much more inclined to amplify the message. There were about four times as many Russian trolls posting conservative content as liberal ones, and they produced about 20 times more content, most of which had a right-leaning, pro-Trump agenda. Conservative-leaning Twitter users were picking up what Russian trolls were putting down. Another recent study from an Oxford University project on computational propaganda found that on both Twitter and Facebook, Trump supporters and extreme hard-right conservatives consume and share a disproportionate amount of fake news. Researchers looked at three months of social media data leading up to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address and how users interacted with what they deemed “junk news” — 91 sites they identified as having problems with credibility, bias, and professionalism. “On Twitter, a network of Trump supporters shares the widest range of known junk news sources and circulates more junk news than all the other groups put together,” the researchers wrote. “On Facebook, extreme hard right pages — distinct from Republican pages — share the widest range of known junk news sources and circulate more junk news than all the other audiences put together.” (The study did not delve into Russian propaganda or users.) That conservatives are seemingly prone to spread content from Russian trolls or junk news isn’t a matter of intelligence — it might be because they are more attuned to threats, even if those threats aren’t real. A study published in the journal Psychological Science (and cited by the Atlantic) found that right-leaning people are often hyper-attuned to what they perceive as potential hazards and tend to believe signs of danger rather than ignore them. “Conservatives approach the situation from the start with greater reactivity to threat, a greater prior belief to the level of danger in the world, so it is logical for the conservative to take more seriously information about hazards than the liberal does,” Daniel Fessler, the University of California Los Angeles professor behind the study, told the Atlantic’s Olga Khazan. Other researchers have also found that beyond risk perception, liberals appear to have more of a need to think critically than conservatives. In a conversation with the Washington Post’s Christopher Ingraham, professor Stefan Pfattheicher of Ulm University noted it’s not a question of intelligence, just ways of thinking. “This seems to be more a matter of motivation to process information (or news) in a critical, reflective thinking style than the ability to do so,” he said. The fake news problem in the United States shows little signs of subsiding. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and students speaking out after it gave birth to multiple conspiracy theories online, ’s Matt Yglesias noted, many of which took root on the right. (Something similar happened after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.) Right-wing celebrity and former Sheriff David Clarke on Twitter alleged that student organizers were being backed by George Soros; Donald Trump Jr. liked a tweet suggesting the student movement was part of some larger anti-Trump plot at the FBI. And as the New York Times notes, hours after the shooting, Russian bot accounts on Twitter released hundreds of posts to fuel the gun debate. The well ORGANIZED effort by Florida school students demanding gun control has GEORGE SOROS’ FINGERPRINTS all over it. It is similar to how he hijacked and exploited black people’s emotion regarding police use of force incidents into the COP HATING Black Lives Matter movement. pic.twitter.com/XDZ3bcwF6F VIDEO: Outspoken Trump-Hating School Shooting Survivor is Son of FBI Agent; MSM Helps Prop Up Incompetent Bureau  It’s a problem Americans on both sides of the aisle have to contend with.

        "articles": "John Oliver is fed up with politicians using mental illness as a scapegoat to avoid talking about gun control — even as they do little to address the deplorable state of mental health care in the US. \"If we're going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control, then the very least we owe them is a fucking plan,\" Oliver said on Last Week Tonight on Sunday. Oliver cited the example of Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who this past week blamed mental health problems for the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon. Huckabee, for all his bluster, actually did an abysmal job with mental health care as governor of Arkansas: The National Alliance on Mental Illness gave his state a D minus for mental health care during his time as governor. But as Oliver pointed out, Huckabee's example isn't atypical in America: Pretty much every politician talks up mental health care after a mass shooting, even though it gets the causes of gun violence wrong and never seems to lead to significant change in how the US deals with mental health care. Last Week Tonight/HBO The only time mental health care seems to get significant attention from politicians is after mass shootings. This is unfair, Oliver noted: \"The aftermath of a mass shooting might actually be the worst time to talk about mental health. Because for the record, the vast majority of mentally ill people are nonviolent. And the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people. In fact, mentally ill people are far likelier to be the victims of violence rather than the perpetrators. So the fact we tend to only discuss mental health in a mass shooting context is deeply misleading.\" This is exactly right. As Jonathan Metzl, a mental health expert at Vanderbilt University, told me, while many mass shooters (up to 60 percent) exhibit some kind of psychiatric or psychological symptoms, other factors are much better predictors of gun violence — substance abuse, poverty, history of violence, and, yes, access to guns. \"So mental illness is important, but it becomes a scapegoat,\" Metzl said. \"It becomes the one thing we can all agree on — 'Oh, yeah, it must be crazy people!' — but I feel compelled to resist that narrative because it gets us off the hook from looking at society, culture, laws, and other things that hit closer to home for people.\" Last Week Tonight/HBO For all the talk about mental health problems, Oliver noted that people with mental health problems still don't get adequate care in America. \"It's a mess, and always has been,\" Oliver noted, before ratting off numerous problems with how America deals with mental health care. The country used to put mentally ill people in asylums, but these were often so bad they were known as \"snake pits.\" Then the country shut down these asylums, but never really funded the health centers that were supposed to replace them. And now, we tend to deal with mental health through the criminal justice system: According to a 2014 Al Jazeera report, people with mental illnesses are 10 times as likely to end up in prison or jail than in state-funded psychiatric care. Part of the problem may be that the nation has no comprehensive plan or policy for mental health, instead dealing with these issues through a patchwork of laws. \"Our whole system needs a massive overhaul,\" Oliver said. \"The public safety net for the mentally ill spans Medicaid, which is different across the country; eight federal agencies, who administer 112 different programs that in some way touch on mental health; and the social service agencies in each of the 50 states. It is a clusterfuck.\" So if politicians really want to do something about mental health, finding out which ideas work and organizing these policies into a comprehensive plan is a good place to start. If mental health is going to be the country's scapegoat for mass shootings, the very least America can do is give these patients the care they need.

        "articles": "You may have barely noticed the fight to save net neutrality — but you'll definitely notice when it's gone. Following an internet-wide day of protest on July 12, many activists are claiming a victory in the fight to preserve net neutrality against a proposed complete regulatory repeal by the Federal Communications Commission. But was it really a victory? Cynics abound — and the likelihood that the protest made a real impact is low. Related The protest, which boasted the participation of high-profile sites like Netflix and Reddit, was a success according to stats from the activist groups that organized it: According to Fight for the Future, the Day of Action for Net Neutrality reportedly reached 10 million people, inspired between 1.6 million and 2.1 million new comments on the FCC’s website, and generated 3.5 million emails to members of Congress urging them to enact legislation on the issue. Since the FCC first announced its plans to roll back existing net neutrality regulations in April, more than 8.2 million comments on the plans have been submitted to the agency (the first window for public comment remained open through Monday, July 17, and a second round of public comment will now remain open through August 16). Though many of those comments have been disputed by developers and data scientists as the work of spambots impersonating real citizens, with as many as 58,000 of the comments repeating the same anti-Obama, anti-net neutrality text, it’s clear that the continuing work of net neutrality activists, which now includes the Day of Action protest, has driven a high proportion of the (legitimate) response. But not everyone is impressed, and possibly for good reason. In the aftermath of the protest and what some have written off as only mild, non-visible participation from its most prominent participants, many people have expressed skepticism over whether it effectively conveyed what’s at stake — or the tremendous effect that a rollback of net neutrality regulations could have on the future of the web — if the FCC’s plans come to pass. Prior to the July 12 protest, news outlets were warning their readers to “prepare to be assaulted” by the extent of the protest, after major players like Google, Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon announced their participation in the Day of Action. But as many of those same news outlets have since pointed out, the aforementioned major players barely did anything to promote the protest where it counted: on their most visible and highly trafficked homepages and within their mobile apps. “If you blinked, you missed yesterday’s net neutrality protest,” Recode declared, while Politico hedged that it “may have flown under some radars.” The Verge’s rundown of how different websites contributed to the Day of Action revealed that many of the most prominent participants had done little more than post out-of-the-way statements about net neutrality on their blogs or add small banners to their homepages that could easily be ignored. The Ringer was especially blunt, taking participants to task for being “afraid to disrupt the user experience to incite political action.” Writer Victor Luckerson recalled bolder, more attention-getting net neutrality protests of the past, during which entire websites went dark or deliberately interfered with their own pages to make points about slow load times and the impact lack of net neutrality could have on a user’s experience of the internet. Protests in support of net neutrality have occurred almost semiannually since 2010, with major events taking place in 2012 and 2014 to comment on pending regulations. The 2012 net neutrality blackout, which successfully campaigned against the restrictive Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), was particularly notable because major websites like Wikipedia, Reddit, Tumblr, and Google went dark or displayed prominent site interruptions for the full day. These stances were dramatic — especially compared with the mild, unintrusive efforts made during the July 12 protest. Though some sites did turn to creative alternative ways of illustrating the point — as seen in the below tweet from Netflix — Luckerson argued that such passive, easy-to-scroll-past commentary is disappointing. This GIF will buffer until #NetNeutrality is safe. @Stranger_Things pic.twitter.com/elSWlOUklr “Such timidity is unfortunate right now,” he wrote, “given that net neutrality is already struggling to compete for attention with health care, Russian election interference, and a variety of other controversies in Washington”: Perhaps tech giants don’t want to be accused of “playing politics” in these divisive times by passionately speaking out against a Trump appointee’s plan. But my hunch is that many of them have simply outgrown the need for net neutrality’s protections, so they’re comfortable paying lip service to the concept without getting particularly invested in the fight. Luckerson also pointed to a statement that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings made in May in which he admitted that Netflix no longer needed to worry about net neutrality rules. That is, the company believes it doesn’t have to worry about losing a critical mass of subscribers due to the inability of those lost subscribers to afford faster internet speeds — a hindrance that would almost certainly be imposed upon millions of people by their ISPs if net neutrality regulations are gutted under the FCC’s proposed plans. Luckerson posited that Hastings’s statement probably reflects the reigning view among Silicon Valley’s major players toward the issue of net neutrality in general: that they don’t want to waste resources lobbying a government that’s determined to roll back existing regulations, especially because they aren’t too concerned that their users won’t simply adjust to any resulting setbacks. However, anyone who doesn’t view net neutrality as a big deal is failing to consider just how unequal bandwidth access in the US already is, and how crucial a role steady internet access plays in bridging socioeconomic gaps. Scaling back net neutrality regulations may not be as immediately visible a disenfranchisement of poor and marginalized citizens as, say, repealing the Affordable Care Act, but the potential societal effects are real. “It’s ironic that the companies creating the tools to amplify political voices aren’t doing more to ensure those voices will be protected in the future,” Luckerson wrote. Alongside cynicism about Silicon Valley’s investment in protecting net neutrality is cynicism about the FCC’s response to the Day of Action protest. “Today’s net neutrality protest won’t matter to the FCC,” Axios reported, noting that FCC Chair Ajit Pai has been unflinching in his desire to repeal current net neutrality rules, and with partisan support in favor of doing so, protests from the tech industry aren’t likely to do much good. Still, some momentum is building both among lawmaking Republicans and tech insiders for the idea of congressional legislation that would enshrine net neutrality into law. The FCC regulation that’s currently under threat protects net neutrality through a decades-old regulatory clause known as Title II, which classifies ISPs as telecommunications companies, subject to telecommunication company regulation. If Pai repeals Title II classification for ISPs, they will essentially be unregulated. The potential upside of passing a net neutrality law through Congress instead of relying on FCC regulation is that it could use specific modernized language that explicitly safeguards net neutrality as a governing principle, and would be harder to undo. Such an approach is not without major drawbacks. Sen. Al Franken recently argued that “any legislation that we would get in the current Congress would be weaker than the Open Internet order that's in effect now.” And the main reason for this is that major internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T could easily lobby Congress to ensure that any new net neutrality laws are as favorable to their corporate goals as possible, effectively killing the “neutrality” component. ISPs’ to meddle in the fight for net neutrality should not be ignored. In fact, two ISPs actually pretended to join the July 12 protest in order to actively undermine it. AT&T received ridicule for its “attempt to hijack” the protest by claiming to join it, which it did by posting a deceptive and confusing page on its website that subtly argued against the principles of net neutrality and urged visitors to join AT&T in arguing for Congress, not the FCC, to legislate the issue — an outcome that could only serve to benefit AT&T, not the open internet. Comcast, meanwhile, stated that it “supports net neutrality” with a lengthy blog post in which it claimed net neutrality activists are utilizing “scare tactics” and trying to “create hysteria.” Comcast argued that “Title II regulation and net neutrality are not the same thing.” But Title II regulation is the regulation under which net neutrality is currently enforced, and the only existing way for net neutrality to legally be enforced, so an argument that they aren’t the same thing seems purposely misleading. In reality, undoing net neutrality regulations opens the door to serious exploitation of consumers by ISPs, which would essentially be able to run the internet side of their businesses with little to no government oversight or accountability. And the changes would come at a time when a major repeal of internet privacy laws has already emboldened ISPs to sell their customers’ internet history, browsing data, and personal information. If anything, there isn’t nearly enough alarm over the proposed changes at stake — which is why cynics have been so disappointed with the lack of visible agitation surrounding the issue. Under the Trump administration, chances of salvaging net neutrality are slim — though Franken did speculate that the issue could end up in federal court if/when the FCC completes its proposed repeal of existing regulations. Still, activists are optimistic. Elliot Harmon, an activist with the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, which participated in the July 12 Day of Action, told me the overall results of the protest were a net gain: “In many ways, this day of action was bigger than the Internet Slowdown Day in 2014,” he said. “It generated more comments to the FCC, and it brought in a more inclusive and diverse range of voices. This wasn't a few companies; it was all corners of the internet coming together.” He urged net neutrality supporters not to give up, stating that “this is a marathon, not a sprint.” However, while noting that it’s important for people to keep contacting their congressional representatives about protecting net neutrality, he also acknowledged that the ball is in the FCC’s court: “What we do next will depend on the FCC's decision,” he said. But since Pai seems determined to gut the FCC’s current regulations no matter how many members of the public make their voices heard in favor of net neutrality, the next step might be to start adjusting to a slower, weaker, more unequal internet.

        "articles": "But Paul Ryan won’t stop pretending it will. For a long time, a key marketing element of House Republicans’ tax reform push was the notion that they would write a tax code so simple you could fill out your taxes on a postcard. This was always pretty silly on a number of levels, but it at least offered a kind of plausible story that leadership could tell its members about why they were being asked to vote for legislation, as they did last year, that raised taxes on teachers who buy school supplies for their classrooms, parents who adopt kids, graduate student teaching assistants, and a range of other sympathetic figures. Senate Republicans, being a more pragmatic lot, ultimately removed many of these kinds of politically toxic provisions from the bill that Donald Trump signed into law in December. The final law has the downside of invalidating the postcard promise. Interestingly, that has not caused the House GOP to drop the claim — they’ve simply rolled out a new and much dumber postcard. Here’s the postcard they tweeted out on January 6: RT if you’re excited to have a fair and simple tax code. One that works in your favor and not against. #2059more  pic.twitter.com/qsywzSPeQV This is a simple 17-line form. But virtually every line requires you to consult some other calculation — often with no clear instructions. On line two, for example, they don’t specify which savings plans are the “specified savings plans” that you are allowed to subtract or give you any indications of where you find the answer. On line six, they tell you that you can deduct your state and local taxes, but they forgot to mention that the amount you can write down here is now capped at $10,000 (previously it was unlimited, though for some taxpayers the existence of the alternative minimum tax served as a de facto limit). A resident of a high-tax state unfortunate enough to actually rely on this postcard might accidentally underpay taxes and end up owing penalty fees to the IRS. Line eight, however, is the one that really gives the game away. Because they elected to actually not eliminate tons of small-time deductions that all have their own little constituencies, there’s no way you could come close to actually listing every conceivable deduction on a postcard. Realistically, people who want to itemize deductions are going to need to use tax prep software or consult a professional — just like they do now. They sweep all of the complexity under the rug with a vague “subtract other deductions,” but of course you can do anything on a postcard if you wave away all the details. After that, they’re barely even trying. You need to use a tax table (they don’t tell you where to find it) to actually calculate your preliminary tax. There’s no explanation at all of how the investment income provisions of the tax code work. Three tax credits are detailed, but their postcard doesn’t say anything about what the credits are worth, who can claim them, or under what circumstances. And for whatever reason, they just left the entire question of the tax treatment of pass-through business entities off the postcard even though it’s a centerpiece of the legislation. Or, rather, they left it off because the whole postcard idea is dumb and they didn’t bother to put much effort into it. For starters, an obvious problem with doing your taxes on a postcard is that you’d be putting a lot of private financial information down on a card that anyone could read, photograph, pass around, etc. Whatever you do with your taxes, you’re going to want to put the paper in an envelope. An envelope would also let you include a check (if necessary) so that you could actually pay your taxes, which is an important part of the process. This is presumably why the House GOP plan puts “postcard” in scare quotes. But when you look at the “postcard,” you’ll see that it doesn’t have a place for you to enter basic stuff like your name, address, Social Security number, or spouse’s name (if applicable). There’s also no signature line. Once you add all that stuff in, you see that you’re going to need a full sheet of paper — just like IRS Form 1040EZ, which already exists and offers most taxpayers a relatively simple way to file. More broadly, however, the way tax enforcement works is that your employer(s), bank(s), and brokerage(s) file their own paperwork with the IRS, which tells them how much money you’ve been paid, how much mortgage interest you owe, etc. That lets the IRS get a decent look at whether you’re cheating on your taxes. It also would let the IRS do what many other countries do and simply tabulate what you owe and tell you. It would, of course, be reasonable to let any citizen who wants to challenge the IRS’s calculations do so and prepare their own alternate tax return. But most of us could probably just check a box and be done with it. The reason that doesn’t happen is the tax preparation industry doesn’t want to lose clients — and they usually get an assist from Grover Norquist and other anti-tax activists who want to make the taxation process as annoying as possible. But that, rather than anything about the code itself, is what is stopping Congress from making the actual filing process easier.

        "articles": "Four cities have just filed suit, arguing that Trump’s attempts to undermine the law violate the Constitution. Outside contributors' opinions and analysis of the most important issues in politics, science, and culture. Abbe Gluck argued, in October 2017, that President Trump’s “sabotage” of the Affordable Care Act violated his duty under the Constitution to ensure laws passed by Congress are executed. This week four cities — Baltimore, Chicago, Columbus, and Cincinnati — filed a suit making that very claim. Here’s the case Gluck made last fall (with minor changes to remove dated references): Modern American history has never seen as full-scale an effort to sabotage a valid law as we have with President Trump and the Affordable Care Act — a law whose legality has been upheld twice by the US Supreme Court. The president has a legal obligation, under Article II of the US Constitution, to “take Care that the laws be faithfully executed.” That means he must make sure that our laws are implemented in good faith and that he uses his executive discretion reasonably toward that end. His agencies likewise have a legal obligation, under the Administrative Procedure Act — the statute that sets the rules for our entire federal regulatory apparatus — not to use their power to engage in arbitrary action. The intentional, multi-pronged sabotage of the ACA that we have seen during Trump’s presidency — reaching new heights since attempts by Congress to repeal the law failed — violates both Trump’s constitutional obligations and quite possibly the obligations of his Department of Health and Human Services. Trump does not get to say that he can best help the law by killing it and thereby forcing Congress to start afresh. His obligation is to “take care” that the laws that are already on the books are carried out. Since he has flouted this obligation, lawsuits by individuals and states harmed by the damage he causes may now be in order. To be sure, the take care clause is rarely invoked. Indeed, it does not appear ever to have been used successfully in modern times as an offensive tool against a president. Cases are rare because most experts agree that the president must have discretion with respect to how he enforces a law; drawing lines that separate when that discretion is exercised reasonably and, instead, when it changes too much of the law to be “faithful” to it (as the clause requires) is extremely difficult. But whatever divides exist about invoking the take care clause, this is the extreme case in which it is clear-cut that the clause has been violated. Far from using his power to faithfully implement the ACA, the president is actively using his power to destroy it. He does not hide his motives. Let’s review some of the acts of sabotage. The ACA requires the federal government to support the open enrollment period — in which individuals must sign up for insurance or lose their chance to do so. The ACA requires the federal government to, among other things, maintain a website and work with local “navigators” and other groups to educate consumers and encourage them to sign up for insurance. Trump instead set out to make open enrollment a failure. He cut the enrollment period in half, from three months to six weeks. He shut down the federal enrollment website for nearly 12 hours every Sunday during the period — a crucial window when working Americans might enroll. He has canceled already- scheduled events in which federal officials had planned to visit states and help with enrollment. He cut advertising for enrollment by 90 percent, from $100 million to $10 million, even though his administration charged insurers on the exchanges user fees to generate money for that same advertising. (Those fees far exceeded $10 million.) One day before the new budget year began on September 1, he announced a 40 percent cut to those navigator programs — after promising them $60 million in grants in May, and after his administration had said it would support navigators in order to partly offset the obstacles erected by the curtailed enrollment period. Why would President Trump want to stifle open enrollment? Because that would seriously weaken the ACA’s insurance markets, which require a mix of healthy and sick customers to be stable. In line with that ambition, he also signed an executive order last week that directs his agencies to consider policies that would allow the sale of new group and short-term plans lacking many ACA protections. These alternative plans are likely to pull even more healthy individuals out of the insurance markets. The same day, Trump announced his plan to cut off important cost-sharing payments that the ACA promises to insurers to compensate them for reducing what individuals have to pay in premiums. A case was then pending in federal court challenging the legality of those payments. The president’s defenders argued that he therefore had mroe leeway to resist implementation of that requirement. Even so, Trump continued to threaten to cut off these payments, creating extreme instability in the insurance industry. In response, some insurers had already raised rates for 2018. So the damage was done well before the official policy was announced. And Trump made clear that his goal in cutting off the funds was to harm he law. He tweeted the same day the policy was announced: “ObamaCare is causing such grief and tragedy for so many. It is being dismantled …” Former White House adviser Steve Bannon was blunter. Trump wanted to “blow that thing up,” he said. [Trump eventually did cut the CSR payments.] This situation is very different from those in which scholars have disagreed over whether the take care clause applies. This is not about whether the president must defend a law he thinks is unconstitutional before the Supreme Court has ruled. That question came up in the context of same-sex marriage, when President Obama declined to defend the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA. Obamacare, in contrast, has survived two major showdowns in the Supreme Court. (And, notably, Obama enforced DOMA while the case was pending, even as he declined to defend it.) This is also not a case in which the president faces tough decisions about how to use limited resources to achieve policy priorities. Such questions arose in last year’s battles over Obama’s immigration policies. Trump’s strangulation of broad parts of the ACA does not stem from his decision to prioritize what he views as other, more important sections of the law. No budgetary or policy justification has been offered by the White House for canceling enrollment support; nor has anyone claimed taxpayers will be saved money. Nor is HHS now using time and money saved by undermining one part of the law in order to buttress another part. Further betraying Trump’s unfaithful stewardship of the law, even states that have requested waivers to pursue conservative reforms are being stonewalled by the administration. News reports say the president has told his agency staff that he does not want any such waivers approved, lest they stabilize the insurance markets. Finally, this is also not a case about the president underenforcing a law to temporarily smooth administrative implementation of it. President Obama delayed enforcement of several ACA deadlines, including the requirement that employers provide insurance, because he believed that delay was necessary for the law to ultimately succeed. He was criticized for that, and some critics cited the take care clause. Nonetheless, President Obama offered reasons why he believed his actions would ultimately help the law. Trump has taken quite a different route. After chiding Congress for failing to abide by its “pledges” to repeal the ACA, tweeted that he was taking on that job himself: “So we're going a little different route. … [I]n the end, it's going to be just as effective.” And he added, “Obamacare is dead. It’s finished. It’s gone.” Motive matters, with respect to whether the president exercises his power legally. If the president exercises his discretion to further the purpose of a statute, he complies with the take care clause. If he uses his power pretextually or unreasonably, he violates the Constitution. President Trump’s motives are unambiguous. Congress could jump in and fix some of the problems Trump is causing. It could pass a statute clarifying the propriety of the cost-sharing reduction payments that Trump ended. It also could override by statute any agency regulation that aims to destabilize the insurance markets. It would certainly be much better for our country for Congress to act than for citizens or states to have to sue the executive branch. But if Congress doesn’t act, lawsuits may be an important tool. The president has a right not to like the ACA. But so long as it is the law of the land, he does not have the right to undermine it through the use of executive power. “Faithful” execution of a law that is validly on the books is what the words of the Constitution require of Trump — until Congress decides otherwise.

        "articles": "Democrats have made Brett Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation hearing about process. The opening hours of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s first confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh were not a debate about Brett Kavanaugh. They were about the Senate’s rules — and who’s breaking them. And according to James Wallner, a political scientist with conservative think tank R Street and a former Republican Senate aide, that’s a debate Republicans will likely lose. This is not the debate Republicans wanted to have. Note: Kavanaugh hasn't been debated once. It's just the process, the documents. Democrats have framed this debate 100%. For months, Republicans have been pushing to get Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court before the 2018 midterm elections, to avoid risking the small-but-possible chance Republicans lose control of the Senate. In the process, Democrats say the procedure, in which the Senate first reviews a nominee’s entire public record and then has the opportunity to question it, has been thrown out the window. As  explained, while the pace of Kavanaugh’s confirmation isn’t necessarily unprecedented, the timeline is. The Bush White House library released 42,000 pages of documents from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House Monday night, just hours before the start of Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing Tuesday morning. “For the record, that is a rate of 7000 pages per hour,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) quipped, balking at the notion that congressional staff would be able to thoroughly examine the documents in time for Tuesday’s hearing. “That is superhuman.” The opening hours of Tuesday’s hearing involved a cacophony of Democratic lawmakers and activists urging to put the confirmation hearings on pause, calling the hurry and lack of transparency a disgrace. Republicans were put on the defensive, having to yet again explain why they are moving forward on one of the most consequential legislative decisions of a generation without giving lawmakers the time to fully review Kavanaugh’s record. “In this instance I think it is a losing argument for Republicans,” Wallner told . “Republicans aren’t making a case for what a qualified Supreme Court justice should look like. They are instead defending their decision to block Democrats from getting access to the documents they want.” With a 51-person Republican Senate majority, Democrats know Kavanaugh’s path to the Supreme Court is close to guaranteed if Republicans stick together. With President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Senate Republicans changed the rules on confirming Supreme Court nominees to only require a simple majority. In other words, Republicans don’t need Democratic votes to get Kavanaugh through the final step of the confirmation process. But from the very beginning of the Judiciary Committee’s confirmation hearing on Kavanaugh’s nomination, Democrats made it clear they wouldn’t be passive actors. They’re saying Republicans are changing the rules again. “We waited for more than a year with a vacancy on the Supreme Court under the direction of your leader in the United States Senate, and the republic survived,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) told an increasingly frustrated Judiciary Chair Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA). “The fact that we cannot take a few days or weeks to have a complete review of Judge Kavanaugh’s record is unfair to the American people, it is inconsistent to our responsibility under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution to advise and consent on ... court nominees.” One by one, Democratic senators went down the line to identify how the Senate’s process had been skirted, from redacted and altered emails to confusion about the process during the hearing. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said it was “out of order” that the Republican-controlled committee required lawmakers to “pre-clear” questions, documents, and videos they’d like to use during the hearing. In his 44 years in the Senate, voting on 19 nominations to the Supreme Court, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) said he had never seen a process like Kavanaugh’s confirmation. “I have been on this committee under Republican and Democratic leadership; I never thought the committee would sink to this,” Leahy said, directing his comments to Kavanaugh. “In fact, you should not be sitting in front of us today. You should be sitting in front of us only after we have completed a review of your record. Your vetting is less than 10 percent complete. In critical ways, our committee is abandoning its tradition of exhaustively vetting Supreme Court nominees.” In turn, Republicans were put on the defense, forced to answer Democrats’ questions about process instead of talk about their nominee. Grassley, who insisted on continuing the hearings as planned, was pushed to argue that Republican staff had ample time to review documents, citing past Senate confirmation hearings. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), arguing against changing the process, laid out Democrats’ strategy more explicitly. “I want to ask what this hearing is about and what this is not about,” Cruz said. “First, this hearing is not about the qualifications of the nominee. Judge Kavanaugh is by any objective measure unquestionably qualified for the Supreme Court. Everyone agrees he’s one of the most respected federal judges in the country.” Cruz added: “There’s an old saying for trial lawyers: If you have the facts, pound the facts. If you have the law, pound the law. If you have neither, pound the table. We’re seeing a lot of table pounding this morning.” The hearing was far from the coronation Republicans were hoping for.

        "articles": "This Tuesday, the Obama administration will unveil its eighth and final budget proposal, its last comprehensive, detailed vision of how the federal government should look. The budget is a key indication of the administration's values and priorities. It's an expression of the mainstream of Democratic Party policy thinking on a wide range of topics, from pre-K to housing to unemployment. Even though it has virtually no chance of changing actual government policy, that role is important in and of itself. The wish list is expected to be relatively small-bore. It won't contain a sweeping single-payer health care reform (or even a public option), but it might offer small changes to the administration of Obamacare. It won't offer free college but might seek more accountability for for-profit colleges thought to be scamming students. It won't offer government jobs to the long-term unemployed, but it'll probably ask Congress to enact a wage insurance plan. This pragmatic vision betrays a tension in the Democratic Party. While mainstream Democratic politicians are concerning themselves with fairly modest, practical policy ideas like those in Obama's budget, Democratic primary voters are flocking to Bernie Sanders's ideas, which are just as unlikely as Obama's to be enacted but also offer sweeping, ambitious changes to public life. Here's what's actually going to happen to taxing and spending this year, what role the budget will play, and why you should be paying attention. To understand the budget process, you need to know the difference between budget resolutions and spending bills (or appropriations bills). The distinction might seem pedantic, but it helps explain why passing a \"budget\" is less important than it may sound. Budgets don't actually allocate funding to specific government agencies. Indeed, budgets aren't even laws; they're \"concurrent resolutions\" agreed to by both houses of Congress but never signed by the president. They're simply deals that the Senate and House make with each other laying out how much money they expect to spend in a given fiscal year, category by category. To actually spend money, Congress has to pass spending bills that allocate money to various parts of the government per the parameters laid out in the budget they settled upon. So budgets are mostly a tool Congress uses to keep its taxing and spending on track. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 gives members of Congress the power to challenge any spending or tax bills that run afoul of the agreed-upon budget. This is mostly meaningless in the House, since it requires a simple majority of the House to beat back such a challenge (and you presumably have a majority if you're going to pass any budget-defying bills in the first place), but in the Senate, where 60 votes are required, it makes it hard to break with the budget agreement. In addition to those powers, the Budget Act lays out a specific process and timetable that the president and Congress are supposed to follow when passing budgets and spending bills: This, suffice it to say, is not how things normally work, particularly under divided government. For starters, the president's budget request is coming out eight days later than it's supposed to. But even once the president submits his proposal, there's little chance the Senate and House will agree to a budget before April 15, and even less chance they'll pass all appropriations bills by June 30. From 2011 through 2014, when the Senate was under Democratic control and the House under Republican control, Congress didn't agree to any budget resolutions at all. Last year, the Republican Senate and Republican House actually did come to a budget deal, but the Senate only passed it on May 5, weeks after the supposed deadline. And even though that budget passed, it didn't affect actual government spending. That's not surprising if you look at the actual content of the budget, which repeals Obamacare and slashes programs for people with low-incomes by 39 percent, among many, many other spending cuts. Actually doing that would require passing spending legislation implementing the budget, and that legislation would be vetoed by Obama. Instead, what happened was that the 2014 spending deal reached by the White House and congressional Republicans lasted until the end of fiscal year 2015, on September 30. It was temporarily extended through December 11 and then again to December 16 and then again to December 22, but by December 18 Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan had reached a spending deal that swiftly passed Congress and funds the government through September 30, 2016. And throughout those negotiations, the boring budget process has been constantly upended by the threat of a government shutdown, with members of what now calls itself the Freedom Caucus trying to exact concessions on debt or defunding Planned Parenthood. The ultimate deal reflected basically nothing in the budget to which the House and Senate agreed in May. It's reasonable to expect something similar to happen this year. The president will lay out his agenda in his budget request. The Senate and House Budget Committee will lay out theirs in their own budgets. Because those budgets will be very similar to each other, there's a decent chance the two houses of Congress will agree to a joint budget that they'll both pass like they're supposed to (though they'll disagree on some things, so it's not inevitable an actual budget will pass). But ultimately, current spending patterns will probably persist until September 30, unless the White House and Congress reach a spending deal lasting beyond that some time before that deadline. Newly elected Speaker Paul Ryan has already begun trying to head off a disastrous GOP rank-and-file revolt that would prevent such a deal, saying in a speech to the Heritage Foundation: What I want to say to you today is this: Don’t take the bait. Let’s not fight over tactics. And don’t impugn people’s motives. It’s fine if you disagree. And there’s a lot that’s rotten in Washington -- there’s no doubt about that -- but we can’t let how someone votes on an amendment to an appropriations bill define what it means to be a conservative. Ryan has indicated that he hopes to wrap up the process in July before August recess, but there's still resentment brewing. David Brat, a member of the Freedom Caucus who ousted former Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a surprise primary upset, said recently: \"What good is it to be in the majority if we don’t act like it?\" The budget proposal process is still important, even though it has basically no effect on actual government spending. That's because it offers both the president and the Senate/House Republican leaderships opportunities to lay out their blue-sky vision for what the American government should look like, and those visions can take on great importance over time. Take pre-K, for example. Ever since 2013, the Obama administration has been including a proposal to expand access to preschool for low- and middle-income families in its budget, financed through a cigarette tax. That proposal never passed, and it's not likely to pass with the most Republican Congress Obama has faced at any point in his presidency. But it did help make pre-K a core part of the Democratic policy agenda in a way it hadn't been before Obama's plan came down. At the time, it led to legislation in the House and Senate spearheaded by Rep. George Miller (D-CA) and Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA), both of whom were the top Democrats on education in each chamber but who have both since announced retirements. Hillary Clinton's campaign promises that their preschool efforts will \"build upon President Obama’s Preschool for All proposal.\" The proposal had influence merely by being a proposal put forth by the president, irrespective of its actual odds of passage. An even more dramatic case is that of the Ryan budget. Starting in 2007, when he became the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, Ryan started putting together budgets that laid out comprehensive conservative plans for reshaping the federal government, slashing spending and instituting big entitlement reforms. His first plan fully privatized Medicare and Medicaid, partially privatized Social Security, dramatically cut income taxes by setting brackets of 10 and 25 percent, eliminated the taxation of capital gains and dividends, abolished the corporate income tax and estate tax, and instituted a 8.5 percent value-added tax (VAT). The details changed over time (Social Security privatization, capital gains tax elimination, and the VAT got dropped, and the Medicare reform got less ambitious), but it still called for block granting and cutting food stamps and Medicaid, partially privatizing Medicare, establishing the 10 and 25 percent rates, and so on. The Ryan budget, over time, came to be the definitive statement of Republican economic policy. It was the key reason Mitt Romney selected Ryan as his running mate in 2012, and why so much of that election focused on Romney and Ryan's plans for Medicare. Without the Ryan plan, it's doubtful he'd be speaker of the House right now, and it's doubtful that then-Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor would've pushed to make the 2011 debt ceiling deal as aggressive as it was. Ryan's budget never passed, but it changed history anyway. Now, ironically, Ryan is in the position of making the deals rather than presenting an idealistic vision of conservative government. How he handles this process will be the first real test he'll face of transforming his vision into practice — and whether he can convince members of the Freedom Caucus to come along. So pay attention to Obama's budget on Tuesday, and those of Senate Budget Committee Chair Michael Enzi and House Budget Committee Chair Tom Price when they arrive. They won't change policy in the near term, but they definitely matter.

        "articles": "Senate Democrats are technically on offense in 2020, but they’re still dealing with a very tough map. The No. 1 item on the agenda for Democrats in 2020 is defeating Donald Trump. But the Democratic agenda hinges on retaking the Senate. And that could be an uphill battle. Senate Republicans hold a three-seat majority and will have to defend 22 seats in 2020. Democrats, meanwhile, are up in just 12 states. But the map still doesn’t look good for them. “What makes this map very deceiving was in 2018, Democrats had to defend five seats in states Trump won by 19 points or more,” said Jennifer Duffy, a Senate expert at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “In this case, there’s no Republican sitting in a state that Clinton won by more than 5.” Just three Republican seats seem truly competitive, as far as the Cook Political Report is concerned: Colorado, Arizona, and Maine. The rest is a sea of red, including the seat Democrats have to defend in ultraconservative Alabama. Compounding Democrats’ problems is a group of high-profile potential Senate candidates opting to run for president or just sit the whole thing out. Herein lies the central contradiction in 2020 politics: Democrats are telling voters the election — up and down the ballot — is of grave consequence. But undermining that push is the tacit belief that the Senate, and the party’s power in it, is a shadow of what it once was. “If people thought it mattered that Democrats controlled the Senate, then they would run to be a Democrat in the Senate,” said James Wallner, a political scientist with the conservative think tank R Street. That said, even if Democrats manage to retake the White House, a Senate majority stands between them and the ability to pursue any real legislative agenda and, crucially, the ability to confirm nominees to the Supreme Court and other important positions. Without the Senate, Democrats’ ideas will remain pipe dreams. To retake a bare majority in the Senate, Democrats need to pick up four seats on net. Because this cohort of senators was last up for election in 2014 — a very strong year for Republicans — Democrats are on offense this year. Democrats do have certain factors playing in their favor. They hope Trump’s low approval rating could ride some of their candidates to victory. After all, Trump is polling on net at -13 in Colorado, -15 in Maine, and -7 in Arizona — the places where Democrats have their best shots — according to Morning Consult. Even in reddish states like Iowa, the president’s trade war with China could make Sen. Joni Ernst, who is in her first reelection race in the state, vulnerable. Even historically red states like Kansas, where there is an open Senate seat, could give Democrats hope. After all, distaste for Trump-like Republicans landed a Democrat in the Kansas governor’s office last year. But the path is tenuous. To retake the majority, Democrats would likely have to: 1) Keep Sen. Doug Jones’s seat in deep-red Alabama. (Trump has a +27 approval rating there.) 2) Win Arizona and Colorado — and they could, since there are already strong candidates declared or interested in running. 3) Turn out an extremely enthusiastic Democratic base and put tough states — Maine, Georgia, Texas, Montana, and Iowa — within reach. Democrats, by the way, still need to recruit “top tier” candidates in all of these states. 4) Take advantage of divisive Republican primaries in Kansas and North Carolina, where Trump has anemic approval ratings. But again, they need solid candidates to compete. With a bare majority, Democrats will at least be able to confirm key Cabinet appointments and judicial nominees, and pass some budget measures. As long as the filibuster is intact, they would still need Republicans to agree on some of their policy proposals — though a bare majority could decide to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster altogether, something a few presidential candidates including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have already endorsed. “2020 is about the White House, but it’s also about the United States Senate,” presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) told the audience at an MSNBC town hall in South Carolina on Wednesday. She’s right. Last year’s wave election for Democrats is giving them some hope. First and foremost, they had easy statewide wins in states like Colorado, where Republican Cory Gardner is up for reelection in 2020. Colorado is by far Democrats’ most promising target. Gardner is running for his second term in the Senate in a state where just last year, Democrats easily kept the governor’s mansion and won total control of the state’s legislature. The demographics are shaping up for Democrats in Colorado; the Latinx population has changed the political tide in the state, as have young voters, and Trump’s popularity in Colorado has tanked ever since he took office. Gardner has done little to distance himself from the president. He’s cemented his reputation as a party man, successfully chairing the National Senate Republican Committee, the official campaign arm for Senate Republicans, and growing the Republican majority in the Senate. He’s also endorsed Trump, and even flipped to support things like the president’s national emergency for the border wall. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper would be a logical top-tier candidate to face Gardner (he won statewide when Gardner came into power in 2014, a Republican wave election), but he chose instead to run for president. Instead, a long list of lesser-known Democrats have jumped in to fill that vacuum, from former state Sen. Mike Johnston — who unsuccessfully ran in the primary for governor last year — to former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, former Obama administration official Dan Baer, and former US Attorney John Walsh. Democrats also have hope in Arizona, where Kyrsten Sinema beat out Republican Martha McSally in a state that voted for Trump in 2016 and has a strong conservative base. Sinema outperformed polling, which showed McSally with a slight lead. In an interesting twist, McSally is up for reelection this year, after she was appointed to serve out part of Sen. John McCain’s remaining term after his death. Arizona Republicans have to prove that their losing candidate is actually a winner. McSally is a well-known entity in Arizona, after Republicans pulled out all the stops for her. But even with high name recognition, she’s still not that popular. Democrats look ready and organized: They have already cleared the field for Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut, military veteran, and gun control advocate. He’s the husband of former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in 2011 at a local event in Tucson. Together, they run the group Americans for Responsible Solutions, a nonprofit and Super PAC dedicated to preventing gun violence. Kelly has been raising more money than McSally, and despite being lesser-known is well liked. Then there’s Maine, which in theory should be a good target for Democrats. It’s one of the few states with a Republican-held seat that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Trump’s approval rating there is 41 percent, but Sen. Susan Collins is a more moderate Republican who has sailed to victory numerous times. That said, her decision to vote for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after he was accused of past sexual assault in the middle of his confirmation process has garnered backlash in the state — particularly with threats to Roe v. Wade making their way to the Supreme Court. Collins’s approval rating is around 52 percent (with 39 percent disapproving), per Morning Consult. However, a recent Maine-based poll, Critical Insights, showed her approval rating at just 41 percent (with 42 percent disapproval), a dramatic decline since last spring. The most well-known Democratic candidate in Maine is current Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon, who went toe to toe with former conservative Gov. Paul LePage, and recently announced her campaign for Senate. Any Democrat running in Maine will have to do well with independents, including those in the state’s rural, more conservative Second Congressional District. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden now represents that area, but he’s unlikely to pursue the Senate seat. So in two of the three best targets, Democrats’ chances look fair to good, but other races are looking tougher — at least so far. The rest of the Senate races will be an uphill battle for Democrats. First, they’ll have to defend Sen. Doug Jones’s seat in Alabama. Rep. Bradley Byrne, a top Republican recruit, is running. Roy Moore, the controversial Republican whom Jones defeated in 2017 after he was accused of sexual misconduct against multiple minors, formally announced another campaign. If Moore somehow gets the nomination again, Democrats might be in better shape, but the dynamics will still be tough. One of the theories of why Jones won in the first place is that special elections are lower-turnout affairs, and if you have a highly motivated base, you can swing them. To win the Senate majority, though, Democrats must be competitive in states like Georgia, North Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Texas, or Tennessee, where they’ve seen statewide losses in the Trump era. North Carolina Democrats saw a rare 2016 victory when Gov. Roy Cooper won the state, along with Trump. Now Republican Sen. Thom Tillis is in a tough race, starting with the GOP primary. Tillis has been dogged by attacks from conservatives questioning his allegiance to the president after he spearheaded an effort to shield special counsel Robert Mueller from Trump’s interference. He has already attracted a primary challenger, retired business executive Garland Tucker III, whom Tillis seems to be taking seriously. Democrats will be watching the outcome of the primary closely. The Democrats in the race; state Sen. Erica Smith has announced, along with Trevor Fuller, a former county commissioner chair, Durham businessman Steven Williams and veteran and former state lawmaker Cal Cunningham, who ran for Senate in 2010 and lost. There are other glimmers of hope for Democrats across the country. In Kansas, there’s an open seat to chase with the retirement of longtime Sen. Pat Roberts, which could trigger a large field of candidates vying to replace him. There are no declared Democrats yet, but Kansas Democrats have a reason to be optimistic for the first time in years. The 2018 midterms were excellent for them; Democrat Laura Kelly beat controversial former Kansas secretary of state and Trump ally Kris Kobach, and Democrats flipped a key congressional seat with Rep. Sharice Davids, an openly gay Native American woman. Democrats were gleeful when Kobach launched his Senate bid, and National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a statement blasting his candidacy. “Just last year Kris Kobach ran and lost to a Democrat,” NRSC spokeswoman Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement to the Washington Post. “Now, he wants to do the same and simultaneously put President Trump’s presidency and Senate majority at risk. We know Kansans won’t let that happen and we look forward to watching the Republican candidate they do choose win next fall.” On the Democratic side, former U.S. Attorney Barry Grissom and former Kansas congresswoman Nancy Boyda have both announced they’re running for Senate. After that, Democrats’ only real chances lie in rapidly accelerating trends in the Sun Belt — diversifying Southern states where Trump is less popular. It’s something they might even be able to pull off if they had superstar candidates, but they’ve already had to weather a few rejections. Stacey Abrams dashed the hopes of national Democrats when she declared she wouldn’t run for Georgia’s Senate seat in 2020. Trump ally and immigration hardliner Sen. David Perdue is up for reelection, and Abrams — a black woman and breakout star who narrowly lost the governor’s race in 2018 — was seen as the best shot to challenge him. Columbus, Georgia, Mayor Teresa Tomlinson is running. Other names rumored to be in contention are Sarah Riggs Amico, who ran for lieutenant governor last year, and Jon Ossoff, who lost a special election against now-unseated Karen Handel in a 2017 congressional race. In Texas, Beto O’Rourke made Democrats believe winning statewide was possible when he lost to incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz by just 2 points in 2018. But now he’s running for president — along with 23 other people. So is Julián Castro, the former Obama Cabinet official long talked about as the man who could bring a blue wave to Texas. In their place, Texas Democrats are banking on M.J. Hegar, a woman Air Force veteran who narrowly lost in 2018. She’s running to oust Sen. John Cornyn, who’s less popular in the state than Cruz. Chris Bell, a former Houston congressman and 2006 gubernatorial candidate is also running. Sema Hernandez, a Houston activist who ran in the primary against O’Rourke last year is also in the race. In Montana, Democratic recruitment is facing an even steeper hurdle after Democratic term-limited Gov. Steve Bullock announced he is running for president. Bullock is the most popular statewide official in Montana, which makes him a natural pick to take on Sen. Steve Daines. Helena Mayor Wilmot Collins — the state’s first black mayor — has already announced his candidacy, but he’s a relative unknown compared to Bullock. Democrats theoretically have opportunities in Iowa; they managed to flip two conservative congressional seats there in 2018, and Joni Ernst’s Senate term is up. Des Moines business leader and Democrat Theresa Greenfield announced she will challenge Ernst, as has attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, who lost the Democratic primary to Rep. Cindy Axne last year. There’s also Tennessee, where Sen. Lamar Alexander is retiring, leaving an open seat. The state, however, was a major point of disappointment for Democrats in 2018; their best recruit, popular former Gov. Phil Bredesen, lost an open Senate seat to Republican Marsha Blackburn. Democrat attorney and Iraq war veteran James Mackler has announced he’s running. Lastly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has officially gotten a Democratic challenger for his re-election race in Kentucky. Retired Lt. Col. Amy McGrath, the Marine Corps veteran and fighter pilot who ran and lost her race as a Democrat for Kentucky’s Sixth Congressional District in 2018, announced she running for Senate. McGrath’s bid will be an extremely uphill battle; even though McConnell has low approval ratings, Trump is extremely popular in the state, and McConnell has a lot of money to spend on getting re-elected. Kentucky isn’t really on Senate Democrats’ offensive map, but the fight in the state could energize Democrats in other races — as long as it doesn’t divert too much fundraising McGrath’s way, away from more competitive races. Democrats will have to play big in 2020 to make serious gains in the Senate; they’ll need record fundraising and a slate of all-star candidates. It’s still early, but so far they seem to be off to a slow start. The very simple explanation why 2020 will be a tough year for Senate Democrats: Most of these seats are in very conservative states like Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, and Montana. “If Stacey Abrams couldn’t beat Brian Kemp in 2018 and O’Rourke couldn’t beat Cruz in 2018, the chances they could beat Perdue and Cornyn are less,” said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College, referring to races in Georgia and Texas. “Those are all really tough seats to win.” But something else is at play. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been calling up the party’s biggest hopes only to be served rejection after rejection. Candidates like Castro, O’Rourke, Hickenlooper, and Bullock would rather mount an extremely long-shot bid for the White House than run a competitive race for the Senate. (It’s worth noting that filing deadlines for Senate in many states happen in the fall — the same time the presidential field starts to winnow. So it’s still possible these long-shot presidential candidates will change their minds if they don’t gain traction). And in some states, there isn’t a big Democratic name of note to begin with. “The variable that explains a lot of what we’re seeing is a party weakness to narrow out the field in this stage, but also to distribute the talent pool or behind-the-scenes persuade people that what they want to do is [run for the Senate],” Julia Azari, a political scientist with Marquette University and contributor to an independent blog on , said. It’s no secret that the Senate isn’t what it used to be, especially for the minority party. Former governors who have served as their state’s executives don’t feel like taking a back seat in the Senate, especially at this point in its history. “As an institution it’s pretty weak and dilapidated at this point,” said Josh Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. After all, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is openly bragging about the upper chamber being a legislative graveyard. Major pushes on legislation, from health care and immigration to even disaster aid and election security, have been stuck in a partisan stalemate. But this moment also says something about the strength of the party as a whole. Democratic leaders are finding it hard to make the case that running for the Senate carries the same weight in the party. “Running for the president is no longer running to be the leader of the party, it’s running to be yourself, and the party will follow you,” Wallner said. “For God’s sake, look at Donald Trump. He wasn’t even a Republican, and now he is the Republican Party.” Correction: A previous version of this article said Maine is the only state Clinton won in 2016 with a Republican-held Senate seat up this year. Clinton also won Colorado in 2016. We regret the error.

        "articles": "Let’s remember for the next time they flip-flop. Republicans used to profess to be extremely worried about the budget deficit. Many of us suspected at the time that they were full of it. And one big thing we’ve learned this week is that they were, indeed, full of it. The budget deal the Senate is passing today will raise spending by $320 billion, split between defense and non-defense measures, in the context of deficits that have already soared to more than $1 trillion per year. In 2012, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the budget deficit “the nation’s most serious long-term problem.” That same year, House Speaker Paul Ryan called it a “serious threat” to the economy. They were full of it. Not just in the narrow sense that they both went on to enthusiastically endorse a $1.5 trillion tax cut in 2017 — a tax cut that the Congressional Budget Office says did little to boost the economy but a great deal to boost payouts to rich shareholders. Nor even in the somewhat broader sense that the real cost of that tax cut is much higher than $1.5 trillion when you consider the various accounting gimmicks and bad-faith phaseouts. Even under the weird linguistic conventions of American conservative politics where deficits caused by tax cuts don’t count as real deficits, this week’s budget deal — a big, multibillion-dollar increase in military spending “offset” by a nearly as large increase in nonmilitary spending — gives up the game entirely. Republicans don’t care, on any level, about the size of the federal deficit. In some ways, this is healthy since deficit alarmism was never a good idea. Interest rates have been perpetually low, and there is zero sign that either Obama’s deficits or Trump’s have “crowded out” any kind of useful economic activity. But it’s critical for everyone else to learn this lesson, since millions of people suffered years of unnecessary unemployment due to bad-faith deficit hawkery. Republicans, meanwhile, won’t always be in the White House, and when they pirouette on this topic again, it’s critically important that they not be listened to. To actually believe that Obama-era Republican leaders cared about the federal budget deficit required one to ignore those exact same leaders’ prior conduct during George W. Bush’s administration. When Bush was president, he signed two rounds of massive tax cuts, oversaw a large increase in military spending, expanded Medicare and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, hiked education spending, and didn’t come close to offsetting any of that with cuts anywhere else. The deficit ballooned. But McConnell, Ryan, and other prominent Obama-era Republican leaders like former Speaker John Boehner were enthusiastic proponents of all this. And, of course, they all duly backed the 2008 bank bailouts when the economy came crashing down around our heads. With Bushonomics completely discredited by 2009, however, the GOP was clearly in need of a brand refresh. What they came up with was the Tea Party and the insistence that the big lesson of the Bush years was that Republicans had moved away from conservative economic orthodoxy. Deficit fearmongering and stringent anti-spending ideology were in; devil-may-care tax-cutting was out. That is why Republicans opposed Obama’s stimulus bill in 2009, why they opposed extensions of a payroll tax holiday, and why they insisted on creating the budget sequester in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling in 2011. All this made the budget deficit lower than, economically speaking, it should have been at a time when the unemployment rate was very high and the Federal Reserve was committed to holding interest rates at zero. Fun fact: Federal government spending grew at 7.9% in Q2. That was the fastest pace since Q2 2009 -- i.e., immediately after the Recovery Act went into effect to combat the Great Recession. pic.twitter.com/uX2fTQlFrs The economy suffered through years of slow growth induced in part by cuts in government spending, cuts that have now been reversed and are belatedly powering the economy forward. Then Donald Trump won the 2016 election, and the rebrand became obsolete. Republicans were no longer stringent fiscal hawks; they were instead “populists,” and the Freedom Caucus is now primarily focused on anti-immigration causes. Like magic, deficits were good again. You’d never get a giant, unpopular corporate income tax cut passed if you offset it with spending cuts. Instead, you attach it to some smaller, temporary middle-class tax cuts and watch the deficit soar. Want more money for the military? Simple — agree to Democratic demands for more domestic spending! It’s at least possible that at some point this will become unsustainable and we really will need to change course economically. But at the moment, the Fed is back in interest-rate-cutting mode, so the deficits are honestly welcome news — even if deploying that fiscal capacity in smarter ways could have led to better results. The critical thing, however, is that if not for hypocritical Republican opposition, we could have been running these higher deficits in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. And if we had done that, the economy could have recovered faster from the Great Recession, the unemployment rate could have fallen more rapidly, and hundreds of billions of dollars of national income that is now irretrievably lost could have been earned. In some sense, all’s well that ends well. But in another critically important sense, the nation lived through a massive economic trauma for no good reason.

        "articles": "Kate Wagner dissects the shingle-style Michigan summer home of the education secretary. First-person essays and interviews with unique perspectives on complicated issues. Two weeks ago, somebody untied Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’s $40 million yacht from its mooring. It got me thinking about another opulent display of wealth owned by DeVos: her 22,000-square-foot nautical-themed summer mansion, located in Holland, Michigan. Just a few more years of climate change and it’ll be floating too. My mission for the past three years as the creator of the architectural humor blog McMansion Hell has been to unpack what makes mansions like DeVos’s so terrible, from both an architectural and social standpoint. It’s bad enough that we have a president who oversaw a massive redistribution of wealth toward the already wealthy through tax breaks. What’s worse is that obscenely wealthy people like him waste all their money building pseudo-castles and other eclectic tragedies, all while wagging their finger at the rest of us telling us to eat cake. Trump official and fellow rich person DeVos just rolled back Obama administration loan forgiveness rules for students defrauded by for-profit colleges. It’s unsurprising that she doesn’t want to forgive the student loan debts of those defrauded by for-profit colleges considering that she got her net worth of more than $1 billion from her husband’s company, the multilevel marketing giant Amway, which is often described as a cult. Meanwhile, her brother Erik Prince owns the Blackwater firm, which essentially sells mercenaries. As we can see, we are not dealing with nice people. As someone who owes tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, getting paid to make fun of DeVos’s tacky seaside decor is one of few ways to both feed myself and make myself feel better. With that, I’d like to dedicate this essay to all of the public school teachers who taught me how to write. Betsy’s house is, in general, a mess. The home attempts to play on the historical American school of architecture known as the shingle style. This style, often seen by historians as a combination of the emerging Arts and Crafts movement and 19th-century eclecticism, is known for its extensive use of shingles as a building material and its multi-massed (massing is a fancy word for a building’s three-dimensional forms) architectural complexity. Betsy likely went with this style because it is very popular in New England and in coastal enclaves of the rich and famous in general. Even though Betsy is riffing on the shingle style, there is a difference between architectural complexity and a mess, just as there is a difference between a masterful use of vocabulary and replacing every word in a sentence with the longest synonym you can find in the thesaurus. Betsy’s house looks like a compound of multiple unfinished parts, and nothing about its hulking facade really gels. This is partially because it has no fewer than 13 window styles — yes, I counted them — and because each of the wings of the house tries (perhaps intentionally) to be very visually different from the next. For example, why is there a massive turret tacked on as if they couldn’t quite commit to a separate lighthouse? The house’s roofline somehow includes three separate roof types (clipped gable, dutch gable, and hipped)? Why are some columns stone and others wood? Why do none of the doors seem to be the front door? (Is there even a front door?) It’s a classic case of too many cooks in the kitchen, and none of those cooks are good at their job. I don’t know how much this house cost, but according to the topical website PriceyPads.com, the house has three bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, three kitchens, eight dishwashers, 13 porches, and an elevator. Something about that ratio of bedrooms to dishwashers seems off to me, but what would I, a mere wretch, too dumb and poor to avoid being exploited by the predatory cost of higher education, know? While the repairs are underway on one of her 10 boats, maybe poor Betsy can spare some of her precious time (otherwise spent being the villain of a Charles Dickens novel) reading essays like M.H. Miller’s in The Baffler, which describes in detail the toll student loan debt repayment takes on working families. Or she could take a gander at a recent Time article about how an entire generation of people have negative wealth. In America, the rich get richer, and the poor have to beg the federal government to forgive the debts they owe to predatory for-profit colleges run by the rich who keep on getting richer. What do the rich do with all their money? Build horrific monstrosities with eight dishwashers and dismantle the public school system. Architecture is never a vacuum. This house sucks, but like all buildings, it is a reflection of both the people and the broader culture that make building it both possible and desirable. Those, too, irrefutably suck.

        "articles": "Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign has always known that it needs to play catch-up with black voters if it's going to win the Democratic primary. South Carolina was Sanders's first big chance to show he could make inroads with this group, and it looks like he completely and utterly failed. Clinton winning black voters 84-16, bigger margin than Obama in 2008, when he won 78-19 That is, needless to say, very bad news for Sanders. And if he can't change those numbers, it's going to be a huge problem for him throughout the South as well as in several Northern states like Maryland, Delaware, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey. But beyond the primary math, it raises a kind of conceptual issue about Sanders's political theory: Given the centrality of African-American voters to the Democratic Party, it's hard to envision a left-wing political revolution taking place in the United States that they have so little enthusiasm for.

        "articles": "Trump voters and Bernie Bros get all the press, but it’s Hillary voters who are going to win. In a 1969 speech, then-President Richard Nixon directly addressed the “silent majority” of Americans who he hoped would support his middle path policy on Vietnam. The speech itself, if you read it, is rather banal and unremarkable, but the turn of phrase came to be a powerful icon of the politics of the era. At a time when American society seemed in many ways to be pulling apart, Nixon argued for stability. And with that phrase, he offered recognition to the large number of Americans who were neither Black Panthers nor Klansmen, neither war hawks nor hippies, just basically normal middle-class white people who rejected Jim Crow without embracing Black Power, disliked the war but disliked communism even more. Nixon’s presidency itself descended into oblivion, but his silent majority of hard hats and conformists carried forward, dominating American politics for the rest of the 20th century. Under George W. Bush, Republican rhetoric took a different turn — more overtly pious and messianic — but in the wake of Bushism’s self-discrediting collapse, Nixonian themes have strongly reemerged under the leadership of Donald Trump. Trump-branded signs intoning the slogan “THE SILENT MAJORITY STANDS WITH TRUMP” festoon his rallies, and optimistic writers invoke the notion of a silent majority to tout theories that the polls are undercounting Trump voters. But though Trumpniks are certainly the demographic descendants of Nixon’s white working-class silent majority, the basic reality is that they are anything but silent. Trump’s rallies are, as Trump would be the first to tell you, enormous, raucous affairs. He brings in big ratings. He attracts constant coverage, and so do his supporters, in the form of endlessly writerly explorations of the agonizing anxieties of “Trump Country” communities afflicted by everything from deindustrialization to opiate addiction to an influx of immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Nor, crucially, are the Trumpniks a majority. Polls give every indication that Hillary Clinton is going to beat Trump, just as she beat Bernie Sanders — who also drew larger rally crowds and more think pieces than she did — in the Democratic primary. Clinton crowds aren’t as big, and her voters aren’t as loud or as interesting to the media. But there sure are a lot of them. And it’s about time we acknowledge them and their emergence as a new silent majority that reelected America’s first black president and is poised to elect its first woman. In 1972, Nixon’s silent majority, grounded firmly in the white working class, delivered a smashing victory for the GOP, dashing the hopes of George McGovern supporters that a new coalition of young white professionals and racial minorities could upend American politics. Forty-four years later, America is facing another silent majority election — one in which the story has been all about Trump’s supporters but the victory will go to Clinton’s. Ironically, the basic contours of the coalitions are essentially the same as in Nixon’s day. Data from the Pew Research Center shows that Republicans enjoy the allegiance of the vast majority of white voters without a college degree — a trend that Trump will, if anything, accelerate. Democrats, meanwhile, enjoy overwhelming majorities among people of color, who now comprise almost 40 percent of their party — a trend that Trump will, again, accelerate. White Democrats these days are mostly college graduates, and mostly women. And while white male Democrats will back Clinton over Trump, they went pretty overwhelmingly for Sanders in the primaries. Clinton’s core coalition is composed of racial minorities and well-educated women, especially unmarried ones. Clinton also enjoys the support of more than 70 percent of LGBTQ Americans and is trouncing Trump with Jewish voters by higher margins than any 21st-century Democrat. Clinton led in the Democratic primary from the first day to the last, and has consistently led in general election polling since the beginning of the campaign. Yet the Clinton voter has not made the same kind of impression on the media, in part because the new silent majority voter offers less visible evidence of being fired up and the new silent majority’s signature politicians — Clinton and Obama — do not do grand performance of anger, even at a time when rage is all the rage in American politics. This is almost certainly not a coincidence. As Rebecca Traister wrote after the Iowa caucus, “No one likes a woman who yells loudly about revolution”: And no, it’s not just this woman. This is a paradigm; it’s why Mom is the disciplinarian and Dad is the fun guy, why women remain the brains and organizational workhorses behind social movements while men get to be the gut-ripping orators, why so many women still manage campaigns and so many men are still candidates. Obama, of course, is in a similar boat. Trump can deliver a speech excoriating establishment elites in business and government who don’t care about his people and sound like a populist champion to white America. An angry black man talking about his desire to burn down the system would sound like, well, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, whom Obama had to loudly and immediately disavow to be deemed acceptable to a sufficiently large minority of white voters to win. There is, of course, something lost in this. The financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuring Great Recession were genuine outrages, and it’s understandable that many voters yearn for politicians who’ll give voice to that rage. But ability to perform anger without coming across as the wrong kind of person is still a privilege in the 21st-century United States, and the new silent majority values other forms of representation that a woman can bring to the table over the performance of rage that her rivals bring. Clinton’s signature weakness is that she is an ultimate insider — a veteran of a system many Americans have come to despise. This is, however, another way of saying that she has an unusually impressive résumé for a presidential candidate, with a longer and wider range of experience than any president since the Civil War. Clinton’s silent majority values competence and experience, and recognizes that it’s no coincidence the first plausible woman president had to be the most well-qualified candidate in generations and equally un-coincidental that in the hands of her enemies her great asset has been relabeled as a weakness. During his August month of faux outreach to African-American voters, the most loyal bloc of the new silent majority, Trump surveyed black Americans and asked, “What the hell have you got to lose?” Black people are, of course, well aware that they continue to face a large number of important struggles on both economic and non-economic fronts. But the vast majority of black voters perceive themselves as having a great deal to lose from the election of Donald Trump. That includes the repeal of a health care law that’s reduced the uninsurance rate among African-Americans by more than one-third, an approach to housing policy that’s attempted to reinvigorate decades-old anti-discrimination legislation, and a Department of Justice that actually cares about protecting nonwhites’ right to vote. Latinos worry about losing these things, and they also worry about friends and relatives being deported and communities torn asunder. Clinton’s silent majority is at times caricatured by her critics on the left as complacent, but a better characterization of the predominant view would be that Clinton voters feel precarious. Voters who are a generation or two removed from the tyranny of the lynch mob or just a few years into enjoying the right to marry the person of their choosing are not that excited about the idea of bringing back the good old days. Thirty years ago, there was only one woman in the Cabinet and just two in the Senate. Educated, professional women chipping away at glass ceilings in their own workplaces see meaningful progress over a generation in politics and hope for more with the election of the first woman president. Clinton’s coalition is under no illusion that all is well in America, but it does believe the country is improving in important ways. It’s skeptical of the impulse to flip the table over and hope for the best, and absolutely allergic to the view that the current version of the United States is a fallen one and the country reached its peak in the days of Mad Men and union factory jobs. Many Clinton supporters — especially people of color who are not enjoying inordinately privileged positions in the American socioeconomic hierarchy — have become increasingly frustrated with an endless parade of pious calls from inside the elite media for elites to pay more attention to the real pain of Trump voters. Contrary to Trump voters, I hardly ever see profiles of Clinton supporters. She's winning. Yet, I hear a lot about her \"enthusiasm gap.\" Part of this is that even though Clinton has a winning coalition of voters behind her, it is a coalition of people who are traditionally marginalized in American society. It’s common for writers to start with the observation that Trump is popular among white voters with no college degree and then fall into shorthand describing his “working class” or “blue collar” appeal as if working-class black and Hispanic voters simply don’t exist. Women, famously, are quieter about their views — less likely to submit blind op-eds or send obnoxious emails — to the point that many of America’s Trump-voting husbands are unaware their wives are for Clinton. But Clinton’s silent majority is also hard to see precisely because it’s so diverse. There is not necessarily a “typical Clinton voter” in the sense that an older, white working-class person is a typical Trump voter and a young white college graduate was a typical Bernie voter. As a mid-30s, non-observant Jewish college graduate, I’m a very typical Clinton voter. But so is my older gay neighbor, and the black mom living a few houses down, and the house next door of single women roommates. The affluent DC suburb of Arlington County will deliver Clinton a hefty haul of votes, but so will the small, slightly-poorer-than-average city of Richmond, Virginia, and rural, poor areas like Holmes County, Mississippi, and Starr County, Texas. You can’t profile “Clinton Country” or the “Clinton voter” as a single kind of person or place. Clinton Country, instead, is like America itself — vast and diverse, incorporating a staggering range of disparate individuals and localities that do not have an enormous amount in common beyond allegiance to a common set of political ideals. In the summer of 2000, Joel Rogers and Ruy Teixeira published an Atlantic article that was designed to be a counterpoint to the then-current political obsession with “soccer moms” and “wired workers.” Titled “America’s Forgotten Majority,” Rogers and Teixeira’s article sought to remind readers that though America had changed over the past generation, it still hadn’t changed that much. White working-class voters, they pointed out, were still 55 percent of the population. Sixteen years later, the white working class is anything but forgotten — at times it seems the press can't write about any other political demographic — but it's no longer a majority. The Latino share of the electorate has grown. The Asian share of the electorate has grown. The African-American share of the electorate has grown. A new cohort of white voters — the most highly educated generation in American history — reached adulthood. The greatest difference between the new silent majority and Trump’s noisy minority is that Clinton’s majority is a coalition of minorities, and it is self-aware about that fact. Black voters, Latino voters, LGBTQ voters, Asian voters, Jewish voters, and all the rest demand respect and recognition from the politicians they support. But they are also tempered and realistic in terms of exactly how much respect and recognition a minority slice of the population can expect. African Americans were thrilled to have a black candidate on the ballot but vote for white Democrats all the time — including ones like Missouri Senate candidate Jason Kander who engage in elaborate displays of cultural affiliation with rural white sensibilities. Members of the new silent majority recognize that most candidates, most of the time, will not be embracing their particular niche cultural cues. Tim Kaine does a speech in Spanish every once in a while, but he mostly speaks English, and Clinton, like Obama before her, speaks English exclusively. Every component group would like more recognition rather than less, but each recognizes that it is a piece of a larger whole. What they want, most of all, is candidates who will advance their interests in concrete, specific ways. Clinton’s voters, like Trump’s, experience economic challenges. But they are responding mostly by backing a candidate who is offering specific forms of assistance — middle-class tax cuts, more subsidies for child care and higher education, immigration reform, policing reform, etc. — rather than holding out for someone who will deliver an overwhelming message of cultural solidarity. Trump voters were surprised and alarmed to learn that Obama could win reelection with scant support from people like them, and have reacted with the Trumpian primal scream. To turn things around in the future they’ll have to learn the lesson that Hillary and Bill Clinton learned 44 years ago as organizers for George McGovern — just because the noise is on your side doesn’t mean the votes are. To win as a minority, you have to learn to play nicely and work well with others. Clinton’s voters — and Clinton herself — have mastered that, and in doing so made themselves the new majority.

        "articles": "Philip Klein is one of the right's smartest health-care writers, and in the aftermath of King v. Burwell, he has some advice for Republicans: they need \"to lay out a detailed vision for market-based system, and to spend the next election doggedly making their case.\" This is not going to happen. Republicans are never going to unite around a serious replacement for Obamacare and endure the political pain necessary to get it passed. How do I know? Well, I read Overcoming Obamacare, Klein's excellent book on Republicans and health-care reform. And as Klein writes there, Republicans don't care that much about health reform. \"Health-care policy has traditionally only been a motivating issue for conservative activists when it comes to opposing liberal attempts to expand the role of government.\" This is the key difference between Democrats and Republicans on health reform. For Democrats, universal health care is a great moral crusade. It's one of the core purposes of the Democratic Party. Democrats wanted to pass health reform more than they wanted to win the 2010 election. They were willing to have the internal party fight over what kind of plan to support, and then to go through the brutal legislative process required to make that plan into a bill, and then go through the political hell of canceling people's plans and implementing their replacement. Republicans hate Obamacare. But every time they actually try to come up with a plan to replace it, they run into the same damn problem — and it reminds them why they never prioritized health reform in the first place. One of the most perceptive points in Klein's book comes from Cato's Michael Cannon, one of the architects of the King v. Burwell case. \"Conservatives are falling into the same trap now that they fell into with fighting the Clinton health plan ... they’re conceding the left’s premises that the government should be trying to provide everybody with health insurance, or the government should be trying to expand access to health insurance, or the government should be subsidizing health insurance, because some people need help and therefore the federal government should be the one to help them. The problem [comes] because once you accept those premises, all of your solutions look like the left’s solutions. They look like Obamacare. And so a lot of conservatives, as much as they want to repeal it and say they want to repeal Obamacare, they’re still pushing replace plans that amount to ‘Obamacare Lite.’\" Cannon is right. The basic project of health reform, at least as it's been understood in American politics in recent decades, involves the government giving money to poor people so they can buy health-care insurance. That money needs to come from somewhere. The government usually gets it from politically unsympathetic constituencies like the rich and corporations, both of which lean Republican. In the case of Obamacare, Medicare cuts were added to the package, meaning another Republican-tilting constituency — the elderly — absorbed the pain. The problem for conservatives is that making sure poor people have health insurance is politically popular, at least in the abstract. But the plans that achieve it tend to be in tension with both broad tenets of conservatism — they raise taxes, it redistribute wealth, regulate insurers, and grow the government — and with key factions of the conservative coalition. Health reform turns out to have a liberal bias. How Bill Clinton got Republicans to create Obamacare. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images) The need to develop and support an alternative to whatever Democrats were proposing has led Republicans, including many conservatives, to back plans they later regret. In the 1990s, for instance, the main Republican alternative to President Bill Clinton's reforms paired regulations on insurers with subsidies for the poor and an individual mandate to force participation by the healthy. Sound familiar? The bill ultimately failed, but it inspired the Massachusetts health reforms passed by then-Governor Mitt Romney, which in turn inspired Obamacare. For today's GOP, Klein says, \"the elusive goal of repealing [Obamacare] has been the driving force behind Republican politics.\" It is ironic that the law Republicans loathe most is actually based on ideas they developed, and that their most recent presidential nominee actually implemented. But it makes more sense if you take Klein's belief that conservatives don't care much about health reform and pair it with Cannon's insight that trying to provide everyone with health insurance is a fundamentally liberal project: the initial adoption of the alternative ideas was largely cynical — it was there to weaken support for Clinton's proposal, not become law — and the kinds of health-reform plans that resonate with the public and are viable alternatives to Democratic ideas will always, in the end, repel conservatives. This is, fundamentally, the difference between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party on health-care reform. Democrats cared so much about health reform that they based their work on a plan Republicans came up with in order to give themselves a better chance of success. Republicans care so little about health reform that they haven't even bothered to choose one of their own plans to unite behind, much less made any painful ideological concessions to clear a path to passage. Don't be sad, Paul Ryan. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Klein's book makes clear, perhaps accidentally, that the real fight in the Republican Party isn't between health wonks who favor different plans. It's between those in the party who want to prioritize health reform and those who don't. And time and again, those who don't want to prioritize uniting around a health plan win the fight. It's five years after Obamacare, and we are still waiting for the Republican Party's leadership to propose detailed replacement plan. It's not as if they haven't needed one, or promised one, or even set themselves deadlines for unveiling one. But as Peter Suderman, another smart health-care voice on the right, says, they haven't been able to deliver: In March, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), the Republican Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, promised that he would have a bill ready and scored by the Congressional Budget Office by late June when the decision arrived. \"We have to be prepared, by the time the ruling comes, to have something. Not months later,\" he said. Yet when Ryan finally unveiled the outlines of a plan last Wednesday, he provided few details, and no legislation or CBO score. The story is similar in the Senate. In March, GOP senators John Barasso, Lamar Alexander and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) announced in The Washington Post that they were ready with \"a plan to create a bridge away from Obamacare.\" The workings of the plan had been widely discussed, the op-ed declared, and \"there is a great deal of consensus on how to proceed.\" But after a briefing for Republican Senators last week, two other Republican Senators—Lindsey Graham and John Cornyn—said flatly that there was no consensus about what to do. Suderman concludes: \"The GOP plan is always in development but never ready for final release.\" That's not an accident. Health reform isn't rocket science. The various options are reasonably well-known. The various paths are pretty clear. There are dozens, perhaps hundreds, of fully formed plans laying around in think tanks and congressional offices. But whenever Republicans decide to settle on one, they ultimately flinch, and for good reason. Health reform is an incredibly tough, painful project. Everything you do has tradeoffs, some of them awful. In the book, many of Klein's interlocutors focus on Obamacare's regulation that exchange insurance can only charge older applicants three times as much as younger applicants. This raises prices for the young. \"If you really want to make a dent in the uninsured population,\" says Avik Roy, a health scholar at the Manhattan Institute, \"the goal shouldn’t be to make insurance more expensive for young people. It should be to make insurance less expensive for young people.\" His plan would allow insurers to charge older applicants six times more than younger applicants. And he's right: that would make health care cheaper for younger applicants, and it would mean more of them get insured. But it would also make health insurance more expensive for older applicants, who often need the insurance more desperately. This is a hard, ugly choice, not an easy one — and it's likely to be an unpopular choice with the older voters who are most loyal to the Republican Party. Some of the provisions in the conservative replacement plans will be wildly unpopular. Many of them try to sharply curtail the tax preference employers get to offer insurance. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, for instance, converts it into a standard deduction for anyone — employed or not. The problem is the deduction is worth much less than many of the plans employers currently offer. It would, overnight, make some of the most generous plans offered by employers completely unaffordable. This sounds like a good idea to many health wonks, including me. We shouldn't be offering unique subsidies to employer-provided insurance, and we definitely shouldn't be making those subsidies unlimited in their scope. But it's political death. It is, in fact, an echo of a plan Sen. John McCain proposed in the 2008 election. That plan was such a gaping vulnerability that, as Klein notes, the Obama campaign's attack ad against it stands as the single most widely aired attack ad of the last decade. (The Obama administration later took a modest, and hypocritical, step toward curtailing the deductibility of pricey employer plans with Obamacare's excise tax.) That ad is a reminder that while Republicans have spent the last four years attacking Obamacare for its tough tradeoffs and unpopular decisions, the moment they begin pushing a serious alternative, they'll suddenly have to deal with Democrats doing the same to them. And Democrats will be doing it from the higher ground of the post-Obamacare world: there will be millions and millions of people getting health insurance from the very program Republicans want to destroy, and every single one of them will be a possible story to use in an attack ad. If a Republican wins the White House in 2016, they'll have to decide whether to spend their precious political capital repealing and replacing Obamacare. Imagine Jeb Bush is being inaugurated in January 2017. Is he really going to want to spend his first year on health reform rather than education? Does he want to begin his presidency by upending health insurance for 20 million people? Does he really want the endless negotiations with the insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies and hospital lobbies and Medicaid advocates? In his Thursday column, Klein warns that \"if Republicans go back to hibernation mode on healthcare after this decision, it will guarantee that the next round of reform will once again wait until Democrats can reclaim power.\" But that is, on some level, what Republicans want. They are happy to let health reform be the Democrats' problem, even if they are not happy with the kinds of solutions Democrats pass.

        "articles": "The actions reverse Trump policies and launch a more progressive policymaking era. President Joe Biden isn’t waiting for Congress to start enacting his policy agenda. His presidency is beginning with an aggressive first 10 days in the Oval Office with a suite of executive orders and actions. The promised actions span from the substantive to more symbolic. Some repeal key parts of former President Donald Trump’s agenda; others lay the groundwork for some of Biden’s own progressive promises. On his first day, Biden will sign 17 executive initiatives. He’ll mandate masks on federal property. He’ll rescind Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization. He’ll extend eviction and foreclosure moratoriums as well as a student loan pause. He’ll take multiple actions on global warming, including rejoining the Paris agreement. He’ll move on immigration, reversing Trump’s travel ban and stopping construction of a wall at the US-Mexico border. He’ll reinforce commitments to racial equity and nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people. And more. Related Biden’s team emphasized in a call with reporters that these day-one actions were only the start. A memo from White House chief of staff Ron Klain outlined Biden’s plans to tackle “four overlapping and compounding crises”: Covid-19, the economy, global warming, and racial justice. Short of congressional action, Biden will sign “dozens of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and directives to Cabinet agencies” to address those areas and more. “In the coming days and weeks we will be announcing additional executive actions that confront these challenges and deliver on the President-elect’s promises to the American people, including revoking the ban on military service by transgender Americans, and reversing the Mexico City policy,” spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement on Tuesday. There are limits to what Biden can do through executive actions. Addressing some issues — including the most immediate crises of Covid-19 and the economy — will require more money. Biden will need Congress to approve that. While Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus package (which includes a $400 billion Covid-19 plan), Democrats hold only the slimmest majorities in Congress, and it’s unclear yet if policymakers will approve a proposal with such a high price tag. Biden’s executive actions, in part, acknowledge that reality, and ensure that he’ll be able to claim some movement in his first few days as the hard work of getting legislation through Congress gets started. Some of the moves will also have an immediate impact — helping millions of Americans who would struggle to pay rent and student loans, providing some relief to undocumented immigrants, and shifting the country toward combating climate change. The scope of the actions is a reflection of Biden running on one of the most progressive agendas in history. But it’s also an acknowledgment that Democrats didn’t perform well enough in congressional races to fully implement that agenda. Now Biden will need to use his more limited executive powers to fill some of the gaps between his campaign promises and hard political realities. Biden will take a range of executive actions quickly, simultaneously aiming to move the nation past the Trump era, address pressing crises, and fulfill campaign promises. The full details can be read in a fact sheet and memo, but here are some of the bigger components: Much of the executive actions are focused on reversing Trump’s legacy, especially on his iconic issue of immigration. From the travel ban to the border wall, Trump did a lot on this topic that Biden and Democrats opposed. But because much of it was tied to executive instead of congressional actions, a new president has the chance to undo the bulk of that work. Biden’s team emphasized more is to come — particularly to make it easier in the coming months and years to claim asylum in the US, which Trump made much more difficult in his years in office. Related But Biden will also take a slew of actions that essentially build on Obama’s presidency. On climate change, for example, Biden’s moves to rejoin the Paris agreement and bring back rules first imposed by Obama start where the last Democratic administration finished. Climate change remains a top issue among Democrats, so this is a logical area, politically, for Biden to focus some proactive energy on. And some of the actions simply address the most pressing issues of the day, particularly Covid-19 and the economic crisis. Still, these actions are limited. They stand to provide some relief to millions of Americans and make other improvements here and there, but they won’t come close to solving any of the continuing and compounding crises that Biden’s team has acknowledged. That will take an act of Congress — and likely weeks, months, or years of work. Although he was widely considered the moderate option in the Democratic presidential primary, Biden ultimately ran a very progressive campaign once he won the nomination. From economic inequality to health care to global warming, Biden promised a big shift to the left on a host of issues. As Matt Yglesias wrote for , “His platform is in many ways a surprisingly progressive approach to policy that the left sees as a triumph of their own work in trying to change the terms of debate in American politics.” Progressive hopes were largely dashed on Election Day 2020 when Democrats lost seats in the House of Representatives and didn’t take control of the Senate. Some of those hopes were rekindled by the Georgia runoffs, which handed Democrats a razor-thin majority in the Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote. But with such a slim majority, and moderates like Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ) effectively setting the limits of the Democratic agenda, there’s a ceiling to how far Biden will be able to go. That doesn’t mean Biden has given up. He’s already proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan, including a $400 billion Covid-19 plan, and a comprehensive immigration reform bill. He’s spoken about finding common ground with Republicans — which would defy the polarized trends of the last few presidential administrations but would give Biden some wiggle room to get more done. The reality, though, is this is going to be a tough political environment for the sweeping agenda that Biden ran on. There’s likely to be action on some of the more pressing issues, particularly Covid-19 and that stimulus plan. But more controversial actions, particularly those that can’t pass the Senate with a simple majority as tax-and-spend measures, seem less likely, such as building on the Affordable Care Act, a minimum wage hike, democratic reform, sweeping action on climate change, or significant criminal justice legislation. Turning to executive actions is a way for the Biden White House to hit the ground running. But it’s also a reflection of that broader political reality.

        "articles": "Trump wants Americans to flock to churches on Easter Sunday. One moment during President Donald Trump’s Fox News appearance on Tuesday served as the starkest example yet of how much he does not understand the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic: He urged Americans to flock to churches on Easter Sunday, just 19 days away. Trump told Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer he selected Easter as the day he wants businesses to reopen, saying he’d like to see “packed churches all over our country” — the exact type of large gatherings that the CDC, the WHO, and Trump’s top health advisers have all urged suspended to help stop the spread of the virus. “I would love to have it opened by Easter,” Trump said, speaking about when he sees the country returning to normal life. “That would be a great American resurrection,” Hemmer replied. Trump on ending social distancing: \"I would love to have it opened by Easter.\" (That's April 12)\"That would be a great American resurrection,\" host Bill Hemmer replies. pic.twitter.com/G1AhP1biNI Since Sunday, Trump has repeatedly indicated he plans to recommend that the White House’s social-distancing guidelines be relaxed and Americans return to work, even though experts say the country hasn’t yet experienced the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s televised briefings, tweets, and appearances on Fox in recent days raise serious doubts about whether the president understands the threat of the coronavirus or how to best slow it down. As he spreads messages at odds with public health experts, he’s putting real lives at risk. During Tuesday’s Fox News town hall — which took place a day after the US recorded its highest single-day death toll amid the coronavirus crisis so far — Trump rested his case for relaxing social distancing by comparing possible exposure to the coronavirus with unfortunate things that we just take to be facts of life, like the flu or car wrecks. Related Here’s what Trump had to say in response to Hemmer’s question about why resuming something approximating normal American social and business life as soon as possible is a good idea (the video follows): Look, we lose thousands — I brought some numbers here — we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off. Now, when I heard the number — you know, we average 37,000 people a year — can you believe that? And actually this year we’re having a bad flu system. But we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies and say, ‘Stop making cars. We don’t want any cars anymore.’ We have to get back to work. Trump suggests going back to work during a pandemic is really no big deal because lots of people die from the flu and car accidents pic.twitter.com/pRTjmLH7xo Already facing a difficult reelection campaign before the outbreak of a deadly pandemic his government was unprepared to deal with, it’s understandable that Trump wants to stabilize an economy decimated by the social-distancing measures meant to stop the spread. But his comments ignore two big ways in which the coronavirus can’t be compared to the flu or car crashes: It’s far more contagious than either, and far more deadly. One reason the coronavirus is so concerning is how contagious it is. Without social distancing, experts believe one infected person could infect up to 2.5 other individuals. Because the coronavirus is so contagious, it could easily overwhelm America’s public health system, leaving hospitals too full to properly treat patients and equipment in short supply. That’s already on the cusp of happening in New York state, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo pleaded with the federal government earlier Tuesday to provide more medical gear, including much-needed ventilators to help patients with severe Covid-19 cases breathe. CUOMO: \"FEMA is sending us 400 ventilators ... I need 30,000 ... you want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators? ... you're missing the magnitude of the problem.\" pic.twitter.com/9VtzlvVOEb Car crashes, of course, are not contagious, nor are there so many of them that they overrun hospitals or threaten the nation’s supply of medical masks and ventilators. That’s also the case with the flu. According to epidemiologists, an individual with the flu is at risk for spreading it to up to 1.3 people — about equal to coronavirus’s contagion level with strong social distancing. Despite this, Trump insisted the flu is more dangerous and singled out Cuomo for criticism. The president blamed the governor for a problem he’s powerless to solve, saying, “He’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators.” (Cuomo and other governors argue it’s suboptimal for states to bid up prices by competing against each other for supplies, and that those purchases are best made by the federal government.) At another point, Trump attacked Cuomo for not doing more on his own to prevent travel from China as the virus spread there. Experts, of course, argue that at best, travel bans like the one Trump instituted at a national level buy time for governments to act — time Trump failed to use. At worst, they’re useless. \"Do you blame the governor for that?\" -- with a smug smirk on his face, Trump tries to pin blame for New York's coronavirus outbreak on Gov. Cuomo because he allowed people to travel from Asia back to New York City during the holidays pic.twitter.com/6syuTlbWdB The whole point of the “15 days to stop the spread” campaign that Trump embraced just nine days ago is that strict social distancing is necessary to “flatten the curve” of cases and make sure hospitals aren’t overwhelmed. But Trump encouraging people to go back to work runs the risk of allowing the virus to spread out of control at a time when places like New York are already struggling to contain it. Trump, however, clearly views the situation primarily as an economic crisis (and thus, for him, a political one) instead of one in which preventable deaths can be avoided. In 2018, roughly 36,560 people died in automobile accidents. Another 38,000 died from flu-related causes in the winter ending that same year. We don’t yet know how many deaths the coronavirus will cause. But a recent study pegged the mortality rate for symptomatic coronavirus cases at 1.4 percent. That may not sound devastating in a vacuum, but it is significant, as that rate means the coronavirus could kill up to 1.1 million Americans if allowed to spread unchecked. Related This is why it is important to socially distance. We do not yet have a coronavirus vaccine, meaning the best tool we have to slow the spread of the virus and minimize deaths is to practice social distancing until testing is so common that we know how far the virus has spread. But Trump’s argument during the Fox News town hall (and elsewhere) was to insist that Americans have already learned the necessary lessons of social distancing and will be careful about practicing it at work. But there’s really no way for a restaurant server to stay at least 6 feet away from customers, nor is it feasible, for example, for people to practice distancing in crowded buses or factories. Trump, however, doesn’t seem to understand the point of social distancing. During an interview with Fox News that aired after the town hall, he revealed this by telling Hemmer that he hopes to see churches packed on Easter. Trump on why he picked Easter as the day he wants to end strict social distancing and reopen American businesses: \"Easter is a very special day for me ... Easter Sunday, and you'll have packed churches all over our country.\" pic.twitter.com/6cXEtW8LmR Experts say the most direct path to normalcy is not to just hope people manage not to infect each other, but to establish a rigorous testing regime, one that would allow us to understand where it might be safe to relax social distancing and which states and cities might require more restrictive quarantines. But the Trump administration’s coronavirus response continues to be plagued by testing failures that hamper all of our abilities to develop a reliable picture of how far the virus has spread. Asked about those failures during the town hall, Trump changed the topic before ultimately absolving himself of responsibility. “Nobody ever expected a thing like this,” said Trump, who worked to dismantle America’s pandemic preparedness during his first three years in office. “Nobody would say that million and millions of people [would need to be] tested.” Asked about problems with coronavirus testing, Trump oddly pivots to bashing the Ukraine \"witch hunt\" before absolving himself of all responsibility pic.twitter.com/76qnbQ5Bqz Fox News normally covers Trump in a fawning manner, but Tuesday’s virtual town hall took things up a notch. At various points, White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx, Surgeon General Jerome Adams, and Fox News contributors Dr. Marc Siegel and Dr. Nicole Saphier went out of their way to praise the president: \"President Trump, I do believe that as a nation we are beholden to you for your decisive, swift action in the beginning with the travel ban,\" Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier tells Trump.\"Thank you,\" Trump replies. pic.twitter.com/GFClRlXKuE Others parts of the broadcast bordered on irresponsible. Before Trump joined the broadcast, reality TV star Dr. Mehmet Oz asked Vice President Mike Pence a leading question about an unproven drug cocktail that Trump and a number of his Fox News supporters have promoted as a possible coronavirus treatment. Fox News's coronavirus virtual town hall now features Dr. Oz asking Pence leading question means to promote unproven, potentially dangerous drugs pic.twitter.com/4c466rFpGS The town hall gave the impression of a dangerously misinformed president being propped up by sycophants who are unwilling or unable to ask him tough questions. That danger will soon become even more palpable if Trump follows through with recommending that people go back to work and pack into churches — and, as a result, fan the flames of the still-spreading virus.

        "articles": "Is a self-pardon constitutional? The answer is strangely murky. Can presidents pardon themselves? The answer, surprisingly enough, is not that clear. But since the New York Times is reporting that the president is considering proactively absolving himself after the breach of the Capitol, the question is still relevant. This isn’t the first time the issue has come up in recent years. Trump lawyers have previously explored the potential uses of presidential pardons — including whether the president can pardon himself — as part of an effort to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, according to a Washington Post report in July 2017. The summer before, Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuiliani said that the president has the power to pardon himself, although he insisted that doing so would be “unthinkable.” I first published this story in 2017, a few days after Trump initially floated the possibility of a self-pardon. I reached out to 15 legal experts then and asked them if the president has the constitutional authority to pardon himself. What I found is still relevant today. As it turns out, this is something of a legal gray area. The overwhelming consensus was that Trump could make a plausible legal argument that his pardoning powers extend to himself, mostly because the Constitution isn’t clear about this — and, frankly, because this is just not a situation the framers expected. Almost all the experts agreed about one other fact: If Trump did make a move like this, it would be both an admission of guilt and a potential constitutional crisis. You can read their full responses below. The president's constitutional power to pardon \"offenses against the United States\" is limited only by excluding \"cases of Impeachment.\" A self-pardon for ordinary criminal offenses does not fall within that exception, on my understanding. A self-pardon might well be outrageously improper (unless there was the prospect of charges brought by a rogue prosecutor, whom, for some reason, the president could not control by firing him or her), but the response the Constitution creates for such misconduct is impeachment, a political rather than criminal remedy. It's a historical anomaly that the pardon power is even in the Constitution, considering that it is derived from royal grants of clemency and the framers of the Constitution, who had just revolted against a tyrannical king, were leery of putting too much power in the hands of a single person. A worst-case scenario like the current crisis is probably one of the reasons why. That's why it's useful to look at Alexander Hamilton's defense of the pardon power, which he lays out in Federalist No. 74. Hamilton notes that \"humanity and good policy\" require that such a power ought to remain in the hands of the president — rather than dispersed among the many members of Congress — because \"the sense of responsibility\" he would feel in having such enormous power over another person's fate would ensure that he exercised it with \"scrupulousness and caution.\" Hamilton also argued that the president would be less susceptible to political pressures and partisanship than Congress in cases like treason or after times of national crisis, when forgiveness and reconciliation might be warranted. This is obviously not dispositive, since the text of the Constitution doesn't impose any limitations on pardons except that they can't be used in cases of impeachment. However, Hamilton's concept of the pardon power was predicated on the idea that the president would be exercising it for the benefit of another person or the country — not for his own personal gain. Of course, presidents can deceive themselves into thinking that their bad acts are justified for the common good (Nixon, anyone?), but the point of the pardon power was to bestow mercy on another, not to enrich oneself. The president is considering pardoning himself as a way to avoid a Department of Justice investigation into his electoral campaign? This is theater of the absurd. The fact that we're even talking about it is a measure of how far we've fallen under Trump. As is the case with a number of important constitutional issues, the answer to the question here of whether or not the president can pardon himself exists in gray area. Or put more bluntly, the answer is, \"Who the heck knows?\" This is partly because this is simply not a question we ask ourselves very often. Let's take a step back and remember the unique reality we all now inhabit. This is not an issue which the courts have been asked to answer. Why? Because a president is rarely in the position of asking whether he will pardon himself. The Constitution means whatever the courts say it means. If the US Supreme Court decided tomorrow that the word \"emolument\" actually means \"sunglasses,\" then that is the law of the land. Congress would have to ratify an amendment to the Constitution to change or override that interpretation. Article II, Section II of the Constitution provides that the president \"shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\" Shortly before President Nixon resigned from office, the Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion in which they cautioned that no one may be a judge in his own case. (This is also a principle of so-called \"natural law.\") This meant, the OLC said, that the president cannot pardon himself. In addition, the language of the clause and Supreme Court case law seems to assume that there is someone giving the pardon (let's call this person Mr. President) and someone receiving the pardon (let's call this person Mr. Not President). Put another way, the language seems to assume there is a grantor and a recipient who are two different people. But a conclusion based on natural law and an assertion that the language \"seems to assume\" something is hardly a conclusion you want to take to the proverbial bank. The recent revelation that President Trump has asked his lawyers whether the president of the United States has the constitutional authority to pardon himself is absolutely stunning. President Trump’s inquiry on the scope of the president's pardon power demonstrates consciousness of guilt. Only if President Trump believes that he may be guilty of a crime would he be interested in pardoning himself. This is not the behavior of an innocent man. Further, the view that the president has the power to pardon himself contradicts a central tenet of American democracy: \"No man is above the law.\" In a democracy based on the rule of law, no one may engage in criminal conduct with impunity, including the president of the United States. I believe the president can pardon anyone, including him or herself. But the pardon cannot stop an investigation and, in a well-functioning democracy, should provoke an impeachment. The Constitution specifically provides that the pardon power does not prevent — or undo — an impeachment. I'm not sure if these Republicans would impeach, but I think that is the only check on the president. A validity of a presidential self-pardon is an issue of genuine uncertainty. Although theoretically interesting, this is one of those questions that seemed \"purely academic\" and of no real practical consequence, and yet here we are. There are two potential checks on the pardoning power that should be noted upfront. First, the Constitution specifically rules out the possibility of pardoning someone for impeachable offenses. Moreover, I think Congress could certainly regard an \"abuse\" of the pardoning power as an impeachable offense in and of itself (even if we were to think that such a pardon should be regarded as legally valid). There are fair questions as to what should count as an abuse that would rise to that level, but a self-pardon should certainly do it. In this context, I think a pardon of any member of the Trump family for offenses committed as part of the presidential campaign or its aftermath would be an impeachable offense. Second, the value of a pardon is that it provides legal immunity from criminal liability for some action, and in order to invoke that immunity, the pardon must be presented to a court in response to a prosecution. At that point, the judiciary would have to make a ruling on whether to accept the pardon as valid. In the case of a self-pardon, ultimately the US Supreme Court would have to render its own conclusion on whether the courts should accept such a pardon as constitutionally valid, and there would really be no option but to reach an independent judgment on that question and not simply defer to the judgment made by the president. But substantively, can the president pardon himself? The pardoning power is vested solely in the president, and the constitutional text only identifies a single qualification on that power (does not apply in cases of impeachment). Our legal tradition nonetheless recognizes implicit limits on that power (e.g., pardon can only be issued after the offense has been committed). There is no well-established legal tradition regarding self-pardons. All that might suggest that the president could do it, and then take his chances in an impeachment. The text of the Constitution says that the president has no pardon power over impeachment. If the president were to pardon himself to preempt a legitimate investigation into potential criminal wrongdoing, it would have no effect on congressional investigations. In the debates surrounding the framing of the Constitution, the framers were very clear: No one, least of all the president, can be above the law. If President Trump does this, and it does not immediately provoke an impeachment inquiry — that is, if the Republican majority can excuse such a blatant disregard for the rule of law — then we are in a full-blown constitutional crisis. The Saturday Night Massacre pales by comparison. That was a stupid burglary. This is potential collusion with a foreign power over the most important electoral contest in the United States. News that the president allegedly asked his lawyers to investigate the viability of a “self-pardon” raises a number of questions, separate and apart from that pardon’s effect on any subsequent criminal prosecution. (The Constitution on its face makes clear that the pardon cannot block impeachment; whether and how it might affect a later criminal prosecution is unclear.) First, it is surprising this kind of a request — one that ordinarily would arise in the context of a confidential communication between a client and his attorneys — found its way to reporters. If one or more of Mr. Trump’s “close advisers” (the terminology employed by the Washington Post) communicated this information to reporters, did they do so with or without the president’s knowledge? One of the president’s attorneys has already denied the Washington Post’s report as “nonsense,” but that doesn’t reveal much about the original leak. Moreover, one might wonder if the self-pardon talk is being raised as a method of reining in the special prosecutor’s investigation, or as a means of distracting the special prosecutor’s team by forcing them to consider a series of unprecedented, even if politically far-fetched, legal arguments. The New York Times’s report that the Trump team is investigating Mr. Mueller’s team for conflicts of interests is consistent with this tactic. The actual merits of these claims matter less than their intended strategic effect, which is to place the special prosecutor and his team on the defensive. There is, of course, no precedent on whether a president can pardon himself. The question is mostly academic. A president can’t be prosecuted federally while in office, so a pardon would only be of legal significance after he left office, and the validity of it would likely be tested in a federal prosecution. If such a prosecution seemed a serious possibility, the president would likely make a deal with his successor (Pence?) to grant him a pardon after he left office, just as Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon. (There was suspicion of such a deal, but Ford denied it and there was no evidence of one.) In any event, a president cannot use the pardon power to immunize himself from impeachment or from prosecution by one or more of the 50 states. Were a president to pardon himself, this would surely trigger prosecution in the states (e.g., for fraud or tax evasion). It would, therefore, be a very foolish decision. The pardon would be admissible evidence of guilt. “I beg your pardon.” That standard phrasing exposes the oddity of the notion that a person may pardon himself. One simply does not say, “Pardon me,” while standing in front of a mirror. This also holds true in our government — in John Adams’s words, “a government of laws and not of men.” To permit the elected leader of that government to absolve himself of wrongdoing — perhaps, for good measure, to do so on a weekly basis — would erode the bedrock of our Constitution. It was based on this reasoning that the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel wrote in 1974: “Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself.” Days later, President Richard M. Nixon chose to extricate himself from scandal not by self-pardon, but rather by resignation from office. Nixon’s precedent should put an end to the current discussion. Even if a president were to break from this tradition, it would not free him from all concerns about accountability. Congress’s powers of impeachment would remain undisturbed. The same is true of states’ powers to prosecute, for a president’s power applies only to federal crimes. Self-pardon thus would do little to advance a president’s self-interest, yet it would do much to undermine our national interest. First, can Trump pardon himself? That’s surprisingly hard to answer. The constitutional text gives no answer, and the convention debates aren’t particularly helpful. Some people cite the Latin phrase “Nemo judex in causa sua” (one can’t be a judge in his own case) as some kind of answer, but the pardon power is executive, not judicial, so a president isn’t formally a judge in his own case. Plus, we don’t live in Rome, even if the Latin sounds wicked smart. The bottom line is that the only significant barriers to self-pardons are politics (impeachment) and federalism (state powers). I don’t think a self-pardon would work. The major question is, What would happen if, after Trump leaves office, investigators determine that he committed a crime covered by a self-pardon? They would very likely bring charges against him anyway, and then it would be up to a judge to decide whether a self-pardon is valid. The Constitution gives the president the power to pardon, but as is always the case with powers bestowed by the Constitution, the contours of that power are uncertain. A judge would probably worry that if he ruled that a president can pardon himself, future presidents will feel free to commit crimes. While impeachment might seem like an adequate deterrent, because removal from office requires two-thirds of the Senate, presidents normally don’t need to worry about impeachment. It is possible that a judge would rule that even if a self-pardon would relieve the president of liability for a crime, the act of self-pardoning itself is a crime, obstruction of justice, that would independently create criminal liability. The president and his legal team may consider throwing the constitutional dice on a self-pardon and winning. Of course, all issues, including ones of this magnitude, come before the court on specific facts, in a particular case, which shape or influence the outcome. The Trump team is not shaping up the facts to its benefit. The president and his lawyers' attacks on the attorney general, the deputy attorney general, the former FBI director, and the special counsel, Robert Mueller — along with the reports of their research into the personal background of Mueller team members — leave them open to the charge that they are considering a pardon as an act of obstruction. This is not a case where Mr. Mueller has brought controversial charges, or where there are other unique circumstances that might arguably support the resort to an unprecedented, extraordinary, and constitutionally uncertain act. All that is so far clear is that the president does not want an investigation, not of himself or of his aides and family members, and he is not ready to let the experienced prosecution team \"see where the evidence will lead.\" Perhaps he is genuinely offended by the whole process, which he may believe is rigged and running amok. Others may conclude that he has something to hide. Mr. Trump may be gambling that in pardoning himself, the courts will see things his way. They may not. In 1993, I wrote an article critical of George H.W. Bush's decision to pardon six defendants in prosecutions related to the Iran-Contra scandal, an episode in which his own role and prior knowledge (if any) have never, I think, been fully clarified. I noted that the text of the Constitution did not explicitly limit the pardon power, but added this: The courts could conceivably determine . . . that Presidents are without power to pardon themselves. General Haig reportedly presented this option to Richard Nixon, who rejected it. . . . [A] President's capacity to pardon himself would seem to violate flagrantly the cornerstone premise of due process and the separation of powers that no person should be judge in her own cause. Interestingly, the chief objection to conferring the pardon power on the President was the fear of some critics that the President might use her authority to shield her confederates in treason. Although reasoning from snippets is problematic, it is worth noting the response of James Wilson to Edmund Randolph's unsuccessful proposal during the Philadelphia Convention to bar presidential pardons in treason cases. Wilson contended that a pardon power was needed even as to the crime of treason, and if the President 'himself be a party to the guilt he can be impeached and prosecuted.' 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 626 (Max Farrand ed., 1937).\" The response of Wilson — an influential framer and one of the Supreme Court's first justices — implies that presidents cannot pardon themselves; if they could, then the scenario he offered would not be a guaranteed option. In other words, this is a gray area, but the Constitution's commitment to checks and balances and more generally to the rule of law strongly argue against self-pardoning.

        "articles": "Over the past 20 years, legal immigrants have accounted for a strikingly large share of American entrepreneurs. Using data from the Pew Research Center and the Fiscal Policy Institute researching small business owners, the immigration blog Migreat built a great chart looking at which countries' natives are most likely to start businesses upon moving to the US: Migreat The light blue columns indicate the rate of self starters among each ethnic group and the dark blue columns show the percentage of all migrant entrepreneurs each group accounts for. Mexicans, Indians, Chinese, Koreans and Cubans make up the bulk of migrant entrepreneurs, with 35 percent. But the entrepreneurship rate among Greek, Israeli, Palestinian and Syrian immigrants was higher than other nationalities. Over the last two decades, immigrant owned businesses have made up 30 percent of the growth in the small business economy, a significant chunk given that immigrants only account for 13 percent of the US population. Their businesses also performed better than your average American. Employees within these small companies earned over $55,000 a year over the median earned income of $41,000 a year, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute's report. Despite this share of the market, these businesses tend to be smaller and are often confined to cities. The chart below illustrates how business ownership among immigrants varies between urban areas: Immigration Policy Center It's worth noting that there's not a single city on that chart where the foreign-born share of business owners doesn't exceed the foreign-born share of the population. Of course, this data doesn't apply to children of immigrants. We do know they lead more financially secure lives than their parents, but a Babson College Report on global entrepreneurship says that second generation immigrants tend not to be self employed because of their increased familiarity with the country. First time immigrants, by contrast, often lacked the contacts necessary to gain employment from anyone but themselves.

The other is that the press as a whole doesn't like Clinton very much (and the feeling is mutual), so there's a bias toward believing that the public feels the same way.

        "articles": "Republicans on the campaign trail aren’t exactly shy about their desire to roll back President Obama’s bank regulations. Donald Trump has called Dodd-Frank a \"terrible\" \"disaster,\" Ted Cruz has introduced legislation to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and Marco Rubio has claimed, incorrectly, that more than 40 percent of small and midsize banks were wiped out by the financial reform law. But the real threat to tough Wall Street regulation isn’t just on the campaign trail. It’s also in Congress, where a coalition of Republicans and a few moderate Democrats — like Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) — are working on legislation that would severely curtail regulators’ power and make it easier for banks and other financial organizations to escape scrutiny, a move Elizabeth Warren and other liberal reformers are fighting. The lawmakers want to subject financial regulation to what’s known as \"cost-benefit analysis,\" a practice currently used to weigh health, safety, and environmental regulations. Applying it to financial rules too may sound reasonable, but it’s not — and, in fact, could severely undermine Dodd-Frank and the entire post-crisis effort to rein in Wall Street. Obviously there’s nothing wrong with weighing the pros and cons of proposed rules. And when it’s relying on good evidence, and done carefully, cost-benefit analysis can be an important tool for, say, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency. Those groups are currently subject to oversight from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). The proposed legislation would subject CFPB, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other financial regulators to a similar process, requiring a strict quantification of benefits and costs of financial regulations, letting OIRA delay or veto rules that fail, and making it easier for judges to strike down regulations in court. The problem is that financial regulations are just fundamentally different from, say, pollution regulations, or office safety rules, in at least three key ways: There’s also a case to be made for the limits of cost-benefit analysis in general, as it tends to undercount benefits even when used in realms for which it’s better suited. What’s more, empowering OIRA to directly intervene in financial regulations could overwhelm the tiny office. As Americans for Financial Reform notes, OIRA \"has only 50 employees, as opposed to tens of thousands of employees at the various [financial] regulatory agencies\" and \"lacks substantive expertise in financial matters. But even putting these matters aside, cost-benefit analysis is uniquely bad for financial regulation, and risks creating worse rules that put the financial system in greater danger. To understand why this is a bad idea, it’s helpful to work through an example. This is what Harvard law professor John Coates, a leading critic of extending cost-benefit analysis to financial regulations, does in a recent paper. His case studies show that cost-benefit analysis will result in \"guesstimation\" at best. As Coates told me, \"Back in 2014, I asked proponents of cost-benefit analysis in financial regulation for a nontrivial rule that benefited from a quantified CBA that you could achieve consensus on. To this day, nobody has been able to give me one.\" Consider one popular financial reform that should be easily quantifiable: increased capital requirements. Both Greg Ip of the Wall Street Journal and Eric Posner of University of Chicago Law School argue that capital requirements would be a perfect test case for cost-benefit analysis. To do a cost-benefit analysis of capital requirements, we need to know the benefits of avoiding such a crisis, and the costs of the new rules imposing higher capital requirements. Unfortunately, estimates of the costs of a financial crisis range widely. Some estimates use Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff’s work to estimate a price tag of between 1 percent and 20 percent of GDP in lost output. The Dallas Federal Reserve argued that the cost is between 35 percent and 80 percent of GDP. Other estimates argue that it could be well over 100 percent of GDP. Still others argue that the Federal Reserve could have avoided all negative effects of a financial crisis, so the cost is zero. These are four reasonable-enough arguments, yet there is no overlap between any of them, and the differences between them are tens of trillions of dollars. High-level reviews haven’t helped. The BIS reviewed 21 studies and found that their estimates ranged from 16 percent to 302 percent of GDP. BIS took the median and mean of these studies, yet any kind of confidence interval would be a massive amount of money. Part of the problem is that economists have strong disagreements on both what counts as a financial crisis and whether there are permanent effects to a crisis rather than temporary ones. There’s no conclusion there, and there’s also no conclusion on the costs of higher-capital requirements from reduced credit. Because whatever results you could find, and they do vary, there’s not even a single theory by which to measure them. One popular argument is that they are zero, because, according to one economic theory, changing the capital structure of a bank to have more equity and less debt doesn’t change the value of the firm. But another economic theory argues that there is a \"pecking order,\" where a lack of information between agents of the firm causes different costs for debt and equity. In that world, a reduction in credit could hurt consumers. The results vary, but how to interpret those results also varies. Cost-benefit makes the most sense in \"natural\" systems, not \"constructed\" ones. This distinction comes from Columbia law professor Jeffrey Gordon and his paper \"The Empty Call for Benefit-Cost Analysis in Financial Regulation.\" How toxic lead is doesn’t change in response to economic institutions. But finance is, according to Gordon, \"constituted by rules and the adaptation to rules.\" Beyond that, changes \"in an important rule will change the system of finance not just through direct, immediate effects but through the subsequent adaptations.\" The cost of a financial crisis is very dependent on everything else the government does. It’s reasonable to say that if we had a gold standard, allowed banks to fail rapidly, and had a very small government without stabilizing transfers, like we did in the late 1920s, the financial crisis would have resulted in a Great Depression. But instead we have our current system, which resulted in the much less brutal, though still painful, Great Recession. Even then, there are significant disagreements among economists as to the long-term costs of a recession, disagreements that can’t be resolved simply by pointing to statistics and the natural sciences. The effect of drinking lead on your body, however, doesn’t change with the background institutions of the market economy, be they feudalism, laissez-faire capitalism, or social democracy. It’s true that whether there is universal health care and income support for basic nutrition changes the damages of toxic chemicals for individuals. But this \"baseline\" problem just weakens the overall case for cost-benefit analysis, and this problem is an order of magnitude worse for constructed systems. Worse, there’s a dynamic element to financial regulation. Any financial regulation depends on all the other ones, so the goals are much less straightforward than, say, reducing the level of a toxic chemical. If there’s a perfect process for letting banks fail without causing a crisis, the benefits of higher capital requirements are less than they would be otherwise. And unlike toxic chemicals, financial markets evolve according to those rules. Imagine the cost-benefit analysis of declaring we will do permanent bailouts of the financial system. That would certainly reduce the cost of a financial crisis. Yet it would introduce tremendous moral hazard that is impossible to quantify, given that we haven’t even been able to quantify it for the 2008 bailouts. With these criticisms in mind, it’s easy to see why CBA would lead to weaker overall rules than other ways of justifying economic analysis. First, it would cause everyone to immediately exaggerate their measures. This happens all the time, of course, with those for and against regulations taking low and high costs. But as Coates shows, there’s an order of magnitude of difference here, and finding consensus would be impossible. It would lead to less clarity over the impact of the rules. Rather than prioritizing efficient, clear-cut, quantifiable rules, this would instead politicize the process even further. Estimates would be generated based on different economic theories and spotty data, and as a result there would be such a wide range of costs and benefits that any conclusion would be no more than a guesstimate. Coates notes that these guesstimates are \"not a true alternative to expert judgment — it is simply judgment in (numerical) disguise.\" It would also allow both the executive branch and the courts to pick and choose among them based on their political priors. And it would slow the process of writing rules and increase the uncertainty surrounding them. As Coates told me, \"You are giving the politicians and the courts more to fight about, which changes the potential for sudden and unpredictable outcomes. The regulatory environment could get more uncertain.\" Professor Gordon notes that \"since the financial system is dynamic, always adjusting to the rules, this would make it much harder to update those rules to a changing environment.\" It’s not surprising that people who defend cost-benefit requirements and OIRA as having brought their own benefits to the worlds of safety and environment want to extend that umbrella further to financial regulatory agencies. Sadly, it’s a much different world, and we need to find other, better, and more appropriate ways of keeping regulators accountable.

The odds of this happening are quite low. But they are greater than zero, and growing. Such a scenario is within the realm of possibility — if it were not, then Russia would not regularly conduct military exercises that imagine exactly this outcome. And recall that Alexander Vershbow, the deputy secretary general of NATO, told a conference in late April that NATO is gaming out exactly such a crisis. There are yet more worrying implications to this Russian doctrine. Its logical conclusion is that Russia sees itself as able to fight a war with the conventionally superior United States without losing, and that it can do this by using battlefield nuclear weapons. Under this doctrine, Moscow is deeming not only full-blown war against the US as imaginable, but a full-blown war with at least one nuclear detonation. That, perhaps, can help explain why Putin has seemed so willing to ratchet up the possibility of a real war with the United States, even one involving nuclear threats — he may believe that through his superior will and brinksmanship, he can avoid defeat. Adding a nuclear element to any conflict would also seem to increase the odds of NATO's Western European members splitting over how to respond, particularly if Russian propaganda can make the circumstances leading up to the detonation unclear. But this also shows the degree to which his entire strategy may rest in part on a shoddy premise — that \"limited\" nuclear war can be winnable — and one that puts the entire world at risk. A deactivated Titan II nuclear missile silo in Arizona. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty) President Dwight Eisenhower held office at a time when the prospect of a nuclear war was relatively new and military planners unsure how to account for the possibility of a conflict with the Soviet Union in which both sides might use nuclear weapons. Though some in his administration urged him to consider plans for nuclear conflict, Eisenhower, no stranger to war, rejected the idea as unthinkable. \"You just can't have this kind of war,\" Eisenhower said in 1957. \"There aren't enough bulldozers to scrape the bodies off the streets.\" Putin believes he has found a way around this problem, relying on smaller, battlefield-use warheads that could win a war without escalating to a global conflict in which whole cities were sacrificed. But even a limited nuclear war could be catastrophic, and not just for the nations where the bombs would fall, but for the whole world. A 2008 study (updated in 2014) on the environmental effects of a \"small\" nuclear war described what would happen if 100 Hiroshima-strength bombs were detonated in a hypothetical conflict between India and Pakistan. This is equivalent to less than 1 percent of the combined nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia. The explosions, the study found, would push a layer of hot, black smoke into the atmosphere, where it would envelop the Earth in about 10 days. The study predicted that this smoke would block sunlight, heat the atmosphere, and erode the ozone for many years, producing what the researchers call without hyperbole \"a decade without summer.\" As rains dried and crops failed worldwide, the resulting global famine would kill 1 billion people. \"We escaped the Cold War without a nuclear holocaust by some combination of skill, luck and divine intervention, and I suspect the latter in greatest proportion,\" General George Lee Butler of the US Strategic Air Command told the journalist Eric Schlosser for his book on the dangers of nuclear weapons. We may have escaped the Cold War, but we have not escaped the nuclear threat, which not only remains but is growing. The sense that this danger is resigned to history books, common in Washington and other Western capitals, is precisely part of its danger. It is another echo of the months and years before World War I, when the world drifted unknowingly toward disaster. In April of last year, just after Russia had annexed Crimea, the London-based think tank Chatham House published a report on the dangers of unintended nuclear conflict. It was not pegged to the events in Ukraine, and at that point few people, including the report's authors, saw Crimea as the potential beginning of a larger conflict. Even still, it was dire in its warnings. \"The probability of inadvertent nuclear use is not zero and is higher than had been widely considered,\" it stated. \"The risk associated with nuclear weapons is high\" and \"under-appreciated.\" Their warnings were widely ignored. As the report itself noted, the world has concluded, wrongly, that nuclear weapons no longer pose an imminent threat. Attention has moved on. But the seeds of a possible war are being sown in Europe. Should the worst happen, which is a remote but real possibility, the consequences will follow all Americans to their homes.

Then, in October, Putin warned that \"open manifestations of neo-Nazism\" had \"become commonplace in Latvia and other Baltic states\" — repeating the language that he and Russian state media had earlier used to frighten Russian speakers in Ukraine into taking up arms. This April, several Russian outlets issued spurious reports that Latvia was planning to forcibly relocate ethnic Russians into Nazi-style ghettos — an echo of similar scaremongering Russian propaganda broadcast in the runup in Ukraine. Martin Hurt, a former senior official of the country's defense ministry, warned that his country's ethnic Russian minority could be \"receptive to Kremlin disinformation.\" Moscow, he said, could generate unrest \"as a pretext to use military force against the Baltic states.\" In early 2007, Estonia's parliament voted to relocate a Soviet-era military statue, the Bronze Soldier, that had become a cultural symbol and annual rallying point for the country's ethnic Russians. In response, Russian politicians and state media accused the Estonian government of fascism and Nazi-style discrimination against ethnic Russians; they issued false reports claiming ethnic Russians were being tortured and murdered. Protests broke out and escalated into riots and mass looting. One person was killed in the violence, and the next day hackers took many of the country's major institutions offline. Russia could do it again, only this time gradually escalating further toward a Ukraine-style conflict. NATO is just not built to deal with such a crisis. Its mutual defense pledge, after all, rests on the assumption that war is a black-and-white concept, that a country is either at war or not at war. Its charter is from a time when war was very different than it is today, with its many shades of gray. Russia can exploit this flaw by introducing low-level violence that more hawkish NATO members would consider grounds for war but that war-averse Western European states might not see that way. Disagreement among NATO's member states would be guaranteed as they hesitated over where to declare a moment when Russia had crossed the line into war. Meanwhile, Russian state media, which has shown real influence in Western Europe, would unleash a flurry of propaganda to confuse the issue, make it harder to pin blame on Moscow for the violence, and gin up skepticism of any American calls for war. Germany, which is widely considered the deciding vote on whether Europe would go to war, would be particularly resistant to going to war. The legacy of World War II and the ideology of pacifism and compromise make even the idea of declaring war on Russia unthinkable. German leaders would come under intense political pressure to, if not reject the call to arms, then at least delay and negotiate — a de facto rejection of NATO's collective self-defense. In such a scenario, it is disturbingly easy to imagine how NATO's European member states could split over whether Russia had even crossed their red line for war, much less whether to respond. Under a fog of confusion and doubt, Russia could gradually escalate until a Ukraine-style conflict in the Baltics was foregone, until it had marched far across NATO's red line, exposing that red line as meaningless. But the greatest danger of all is if Putin's plan were to stumble: By overreaching, by underestimating Western resolve to defend the Baltics, or by starting something that escalates beyond his control, it could all too easily lead to full-blown war. \"That kind of misperception situation is definitely possible, and that’s how wars start,\" Saideman said, going on to compare Europe today with 1914, just before World War I. \"The thing that makes war most thinkable is when other people don’t think it’s thinkable.\" In 1963, a few months after the Cuban missile crisis had almost brought the US and Soviet Union to blows, President John F. Kennedy gave a speech drawing on the lessons of the world's brush with nuclear war: \"Above all, while defending our vital interests, nuclear powers must avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war.\" That is the choice that Putin may well force upon NATO. Evgeny Buzhinsky has spent much of his professional life with the threat of global nuclear destruction hanging over his head. A lifelong Russian military officer, he earned his PhD in military sciences in 1982, just as the Cold War entered one of its most dangerous periods, and rose to the General Staff, where he remained for years after the Soviet Union's collapse, through periods of calm and of tension. He retired in 2009 as a lieutenant general and remains active in Russian national security circles, now heading the PIR Center, a well-respected Russian think tank that focuses on military, national security, and arms control issues. Buzhinsky, when I met him in Moscow, had a warning for me. Those in the West who worried about the possibility of a major war breaking out in the Baltics were missing the real threat: Ukraine. The US, he feared, does not appreciate how far Russia is willing to go to avoid a defeat in Ukraine, and this miscalculation could pull them into conflict. Read the full interview with former Russian General Evgeny Buzhinsky \"Ukraine, for Russia, is a red line,\" he warned. \"And especially a Ukraine that is hostile to Russia is a definite red line. But the US administration decided that it's not.\" This was a concern I heard more than once in Russia. When Fyodor Lukyanov, the Moscow foreign policy insider, warned that Russian foreign policy officials saw a major war as increasingly possible, and I asked him how they thought it would happen, he cited Ukraine. \"For example, massive military help to Ukraine from the United States — it could start as a proxy war, and then ...\" he trailed off Lukyanov worried that the US does not understand Russia's sense of ownership over Ukraine, the lengths it would go to protect its interests there. \"It’s seen by many people as something that’s actually a part of our country, or if not part of our country then a country that’s absolutely essential to Russia’s security,\" he said. Buzhinsky is one of those people. Like Lukyanov and other Russian analysts, he worried that the United States had wrongly concluded that Putin would ultimately acquiesce if he faced likely defeat in Ukraine. The Americans, he said, were dangerously mistaken. Gregarious, bear-sized, and clearly accustomed to dealing with Westerners from overseeing arms control treaties during much of the 1990s, Buzhinsky sipped a grapefruit juice when we met in downtown Moscow. \"A year ago, I was absolutely convinced Russia would never intervene militarily,\" he said about the possibility of a full, overt Russian invasion of Ukraine. \"Now I'm not so sure.\" The view of the Russian government, he said, was that it could never allow the defeat of the pro-Russia separatist rebels in the eastern Ukraine region sometimes called Donbas. (In August, when those rebels appeared on the verge of defeat, Russia provided them with artillery support and covertly sent troops to fight alongside them, none of which Moscow has acknowledged.) If Ukrainian forces were about to overrun the separatist rebels, Buzhinsky said, he believed that Russia would respond not just with an overt invasion, but by marching to Ukraine's capital of Kiev. \"A massive offensive on the Ukrainian side\" against the rebels, he said, would lead Russia to openly enter the war. \"A war with Russia in Ukraine — if Russia starts a war, it never stops until it takes the capital.\" When I asked Buzhinsky if he really believed Putin would launch a full Russian invasion of Kiev in response to a Ukrainian effort to retake Donbas, he answered, \"Yes, definitely. He said twice publicly, 'I won't let it happen.' As he is a man of his word, I am sure he will.\" Such a scenario, he said, could lead to a larger conflict no one wants. The Americans believe that \"Russia will never dare, Putin will never dare, to interfere,\" leaving the US unprepared in case it should happen. \"And then I could not predict the reaction of the United States and NATO.\" Buzhinsky outlined another way he feared Ukraine could lead to a larger war. If the US provided sophisticated military equipment to Ukraine that required putting American trainers or operators near the front lines, and one of them was killed, he believed the US might feel compelled to intervene outright in Ukraine. Would Russia really risk a major war over Ukraine, one of Europe's poorest countries? For months, Moscow has been suggesting that Western military involvement in Ukraine, even something as mild as providing the Ukrainian military with certain arms, would be taken as an act of war against Russia. Like Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons, this has been shrugged off as bluster, mere rhetoric, just for scoring domestic political points. What Buzhinsky was trying to underline to me was that the threats are real — that Russia might consider its interests in Ukraine so vital that it would risk or even fight a war to protect them. He was not alone in saying this — I heard it from many others in Moscow, including Russian analysts who are critical of their country's Ukraine policy as too aggressive. Buzhinsky explained that Russia had set this as a red line out of the fear that a Ukrainian reconquest of eastern Ukraine would lead to \"the physical extermination of the people of Donbas,\" many of whom are Russian speakers with cultural links to Russia. Russian state media has drilled this fear into the peoples of Ukraine and Russia for a year now. It does not have to be true to serve as casus belli; Moscow deployed a similar justification for its annexation of Crimea. The connection to Ukraine is often expressed by everyday Russians as an issue of cultural heritage; Kievan Rus, a medieval Slavic federation with its capital in the present-day Ukrainian capital of Kiev, is something like Russia's predecessor state. But this is likely about more than nationalism or kinship with Russian-speaking Ukrainians. Moscow is notorious for its conviction that the US is bent on Russia's destruction, or at least its subjugation. It is paranoid and painfully aware of its isolation and its comparative weakness. A hostile and pro-Western Ukraine, Putin may have concluded, would pose an existential threat by further weakening Russia beyond what it can afford. Allison and Simes, in their essay on the risk of war, described Ukraine as a potential ground zero for wider conflict because of this. \"Russia’s establishment sentiment holds that the country can never be secure if Ukraine joins NATO or becomes a part of a hostile Euro-Atlantic community,\" they wrote. \"From [Moscow's] perspective, this makes Ukraine’s non-adversarial status a non-negotiable demand for any Russia powerful enough to defend its national-security interests.\" It is practically a cliché in international relations: \"Russia without Ukraine is a country, Russia with Ukraine is an empire.\" Putin's Russia appears to believe that reclaiming great-power status is the only way it can guarantee security against a hostile West. Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert, traced this Russian government obsession with Ukraine back to Putin's political weakness at home, as well as Russia's sense of military insecurity against a hostile and overwhelmingly powerful West. \"I suspect that the desire to unite the Russian world and to subjugate the non-Russian neighbors is driven by a fundamental sense of insecurity,\" Lewis said in a much-circulated September podcast on Putin's nuclear threats. \"That, like the Soviet leadership, he has to try very hard to stay in power, and so there’s a tendency as his legitimacy declines to try to blame outside forces. And the problem is that when you try to look at the world in that conspiratorial way, there’s always a justification for subjugating the next set of neighbors.\" This means that should the US or other Western countries become sufficiently involved in Ukraine that Russia cannot maintain control of the conflict, then Russia may feel this puts it at such existential threat that it has no choice but to escalate in response. Even at the risk of war. Russia knows it would lose a full-blown war with NATO, of course, but it has other options. An official with the Russian Defense Ministry's public advisory board told the Moscow Times that should Western countries arm Ukraine's military, it would respond by escalating in Ukraine itself as well as \"asymmetrically against Washington or its allies on other fronts.\" Russian asymmetrical acts — cyberattacks, propaganda operations meant to create panic, military flights, even little green men — are all effective precisely because they introduce uncertainty and risk. If that sounds dangerous, it is. American and NATO red lines for what acts of \"asymmetry\" would and would not trigger war are unclear and poorly defined. Russia could easily cross such a line without meaning to, or could create enough confusion that the US believes it or its allies are under a severe enough threat to demand retaliation. \"You don't get to walk this back,\" Matthew Rojansky, the director of the Kennan Institute, warned in comments to the New York Times about what could happen if the US armed Ukraine's military, as Congress is pushing Obama to do. \"Once we have done this we become a belligerent party in a proxy war with Russia, the only country on Earth that can destroy the United States,\" Rojansky said. \"That’s why this is a big deal.\" This August, as the Russian military launched its undeclared and unofficial invasion of eastern Ukraine to defend separatist rebels there against defeat, Putin attended an annual youth conference at Lake Seliger, just north of Moscow. During a Q&A session, a teaching student asked an odd question about the \"cyclical\" nature of history and concerns that Russia could be \"drawn into a new, open global conflict.\" Putin, in his answer, did something that the leaders of major nuclear powers generally avoid doing — he rattled the nuclear saber a bit: Let me remind you that Russia is one of the world’s biggest nuclear powers. These are not just words — this is the reality. What’s more, we are strengthening our nuclear deterrent capability and developing our armed forces. They have become more compact and effective and are becoming more modern in terms of the weapons at their disposal. There is a certain fear in Russia, never far from the surface, that the only thing preventing the West from realizing its dream of destroying or subjugating Russia is its nuclear arsenal. (Three months later, Putin warned that the West wanted to tame the Russian bear so as to \"tear out his fangs and his claws,\" which he explained meant its nuclear weapons.) \"There is a widespread belief that the only guarantee for Russian security, if not sovereignty and existence, is the nuclear deterrent,\" Lukyanov, the Russian foreign policy expert, explained. \"After the Yugoslavia wars, Iraq War, Libyan intervention, it’s not an argument anymore, it’s conventional wisdom: 'If Russia were not a nuclear superpower, the regime change of an Iraqi or Libyan style would be inevitable here. The Americans are so unhappy with the Russian regime, they would do it. Praise God, we have a nuclear arsenal, and that makes us untouchable.'\" But Russia faced a problem: Its conventional military forces are now so much weaker than NATO's, and its capital city so close to NATO's forces in the Baltics, that it feared NATO tank divisions could push all the way to Moscow and quickly win a war without ever using a nuclear weapon. Both the US and Russia had pledged to use nuclear weapons only to deter one another from nuclear attacks. This kept the Cold War cold. But because the US would not need its ICBMs to win a war, that deterrence is no longer enough to keep Russia safe. In response, Russia has been gradually lowering its bar for when it would use nuclear weapons, and in the process upending the decades-old logic of mutually assured destruction, adding tremendous nuclear danger to any conflict in Europe. The possibility that a limited or unintended skirmish could spiral into nuclear war is higher than ever. Russia's nuclear doctrine, a formal document the Kremlin publishes every few years outlining when it will and will not use nuclear weapons, declares that the Russian military can launch nuclear weapons not just in the case of a nuclear attack, but in case of a conventional military attack that poses an existential threat. In other words, if Russia believes that American tanks could be bound for the Kremlin, it has declared it may respond by dropping nuclear bombs.

(DMITRY SEREBRYAKOV/AFP/Getty) The danger that this adds to any possible confrontation, particularly along the Baltic states, is difficult to overstate. If an accident or miscalculation were to lead to a border skirmish, all it would take is for the Kremlin to misperceive the fighting as the beginning of an assault toward Moscow and its own doctrine would call for using nuclear weapons. Indeed, it would be the only way to avoid total defeat. There is another layer of danger and uncertainty to this: It is not clear what Russia would consider a conventional threat worthy of a nuclear response. A few months after he'd annexed Crimea, Putin revealed that during Russia's undeclared invasion of the territory he had considered putting his country's nuclear forces on alert; his government has signaled it would consider using nuclear force to defend Crimea from an attack, something Russian analysts told me was not just bluster. The United States, of course, has no intention of militarily retaking Crimea, despite surprisingly common fears to the contrary in Russia. But Russian paranoia about such a threat, and a possible willingness to use nuclear weapons to avert it, adds more danger to the already dangerous war in eastern Ukraine and the fears that greater Russian or Western involvement there could spark a broader conflict. And the Crimea revelation raises a disconcerting question: Where exactly does Moscow place the line for a threat severe enough to use nuclear weapons? Its doctrine says they should be used only against an existential threat, but an attack on Crimea would be far from existentially dangerous. We can only guess where the real red line lays, and hope not to cross it by mistake. There is a specific moment that arms control experts often cite to highlight the dangers of nuclear weapons, how they kept the world poised, for years at a time, mere minutes away from nuclear devastation. That moment was September 26, 1983. That evening, a Russian lieutenant colonel named Stanislav Petrov settled in for his shift overseeing the Soviet Union's missile attack early warning system. Petrov had a top-secret network of satellites, all pointed squarely at the United States and its arsenal of nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles, which pointed back at him. The US and Soviet Union were ramping up development of ICBMs, which could circle the globe in 30 minutes and reduce an enemy city to ash. Both sides were driven by fear that the other could one day gain the ability to launch a preemptive nuclear strike so devastating and so fast that it would start and win the war within hours. Each sought to develop ever more sensitive warning systems, and ever more rapid mechanisms for retaliation, to deter the threat. Petrov ran one such warning system. If he caught an American attack as soon as it crossed his sensors, it would give the Soviet leadership about 20 minutes of warning time. That was their window to determine how to respond. The space for mistakes was effectively zero. Five hours into Petrov's shift that night, something he had never encountered in his 11-year career happened: The system went into full alarm. The word \"LAUNCH\" displayed in large red letters. The screen announced a \"high reliability\" of an American ICBM barreling toward the Soviet Union. Petrov had to make a decision: Would he report an incoming American strike? If he did, Soviet nuclear doctrine called for a full nuclear retaliation; there would be no time to double-check the warning system, much less seek negotiations with the US. If he didn't, and he was wrong, he would have left his country defenseless, an act tantamount to treason. His gut instinct told him the warning was in error, but when he flipped through the incoming imagery and data and he could reach no hard conclusion from it. After a few moments, he called his superiors and stated categorically that it was a false alarm. There was, he insisted, no attack. Petrov waited in agony for 23 minutes — the missile's estimated time to target — before he knew for sure that he'd been right. Only a few people were aware of it at the time, but thanks to Petrov, the world had only barely avoided World War III and, potentially, total nuclear annihilation. The US and Soviet Union, shaken by this and other near-misses, spent the next few years stepping back from the brink. They decommissioned a large number of nuclear warheads and signed treaties to limit their deployment. One of their most important measures was a 1987 agreement called the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which saw both sides conclude that the medium-range, land-based nuclear missiles they'd stuffed across Europe were simply too dangerous and destabilizing to be allowed. Because the missiles could reach Moscow or Berlin or London at lightening speeds, they shortened the \"response time\" to any crisis — the window in which a Soviet or Western leader would have to decide whether the country was under attack before such an attack would hit — to just a few minutes. They made the danger of an unintended escalation, or of an error like the that one Petrov only barely prevented, far greater. The risk they posed was deemed, in the 1987 INF Treaty, unacceptable to the world. And the weapons were removed. Putin has taken several steps to push Europe back toward the nuclear brink, to the logic of nuclear escalation and hair-trigger weapons that made the early 1980s, by many accounts, the most dangerous time in human history. Perhaps most drastically, he appears to have undone the 1987 INF Treaty, reintroducing the long-banned nuclear weapons. In March, Russia announced it would place nuclear-capable bombers and medium-range, nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad — only an hour, by commercial airliner, from Berlin. Meanwhile, it has been testing medium-range, land-based missiles. The missiles, to the alarm of the United States, appear to violate the INF Treaty.

He is developing more nuclear weapons, and calling frequent attention to them, as apparent cover for his aggression and adventurism in Europe. There are suspicions, for example, that Russia may have deployed nuclear-armed submarines off of the US Eastern Seaboard. What makes this so dangerous is that Putin appears to believe, as the scholar Edward Lucas outlined in a recent report for the Center for European Policy Analysis, that he has a greater willingness than NATO to use nuclear weapons, and thus that his superior will allows him to bully the otherwise stronger Western powers with games of nuclear chicken. This is a substantial, and indeed terrifying, break from Cold War–era nuclear thinking, in which both sides rightly feared nuclear brinksmanship as too dangerous to contemplate and used their weapons primarily to deter one another. \"Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling is unjustified, destabilizing and dangerous,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a May speech in Washington. Putin is acting out of an apparent belief that increasing the nuclear threat to Europe, and as a result to his own country, is ultimately good for Russia and worth the risks. It is a gamble with the lives of hundreds of millions of Europeans, and perhaps many beyond, at stake. The view among many Western analysts is that the nuclear-capable missiles are meant as a gun against the heads of the Americans and the Europeans: You better not mess with us Russians, or who knows what we'll do. Putin himself endorsed this view in a 2014 speech in Sochi, where he approvingly cited Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's 1960 address to the United Nations, when he hammered his shoe on the podium. \"The United States and NATO thought, 'This Nikita is best left alone, he might just go and fire a missile. We better show some respect for them,'\" Putin said. This sort of a nuclear threat could be a perfect way for Putin to attempt the sort of NATO-splitting scenario described by analysts like Piontkovsky. What if, Lucas asked as an example in his report, Putin found some excuse to declare a Russian \"military exclusion zone\" in the Baltic Sea, thus physically cutting off the Baltic states from the rest of NATO? \"Would America really risk a nuclear standoff with Russia over a gas pipeline?\" Lucas asked. \"If it would not, NATO is over. The nuclear bluff that sustained the Western alliance through all the decades of the Cold War would have been called at last.\" Putin's love of brinksmanship, while perhaps born of Russia's weakness, is also deeply worrying for what it says about the leader's willingness and even eagerness to take on huge geopolitical risk. \"Either he has a very weird theory of nuclear weapons, or he just doesn’t take the West seriously and is trying to cow us with whatever threat he can make,\" Saideman, the political scientist, said, going on to draw yet another of the many parallels analysts have drawn to the onset of World War I. \"There are two visions of international relations: One is that threats work, and one is that threats don’t, where they cause counter-balancing,\" Saideman continued. \"This was the theory of the [German] Kaiser before World War I: the more threatening you are, the more people will submit to your will. That might be Putin’s logic, that he’s just going to threaten and threaten and hope that NATO bends. But the long run of international relations suggests that it goes the other way, where the more threatening you are the more you produce balancing.\" In other words, Putin is hoping to compensate for his weakness by expressing his willingness to go further, and to raise the stakes higher, than the more powerful Western nations. But his actions are premised on a flawed understanding of how the world works. In fact, he is virtually forcing the West to respond in kind, raising not just the risk of a possible war, but the ease with which such a war would go nuclear. (Dmitri Dukhanin/Kommersant via Getty) There is a corollary in Russia's nuclear doctrine, a way in which the Russians believe they have solved the problem of Western military superiority, that is so foolhardy, so dangerous, that it is difficult to believe they really mean it. And yet, there is every indication that they do. That corollary is Russia's embrace of what it calls a \"de-escalation\" nuclear strike. Go back to the scenario spelled out in Russia's military doctrine: a conventional military conflict that poses an existential threat to the country. The doctrine calls for Russia to respond with a nuclear strike. But imagine you're a Russian leader: How do you drop a nuclear bomb on NATO's troops without forcing the US to respond with a nuclear strike in kind, setting off a tit-for-tat cycle of escalation that would end in total nuclear war and global devastation? Russia's answer, in the case of such a conflict, is to drop a single nuclear weapon — one from the family of smaller, battlefield-use nukes known as \"tactical\" weapons, rather than from the larger, city-destroying \"strategic\" nuclear weapons. The idea is that such a strike would signal Russia's willingness to use nuclear weapons, and would force the enemy to immediately end the fight rather than risk further nuclear destruction. Nikolai Sokov, a nuclear weapons expert and former official in the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, explained in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists that this is not a far-fetched option of last resort; it has become central to Russian war planning. \"Such a threat is envisioned as deterring the United States and its allies from involvement in conflicts in which Russia has an important stake, and in this sense is essentially defensive,\" Sokov wrote. \"Yet, to be effective, such a threat also must be credible. To that end, all large-scale military exercises that Russia conducted beginning in 2000 featured simulations of limited nuclear strikes.\" Buzhinsky, the recently retired member of Russia's General Staff, confirmed in our meeting that this is something the military sees as a viable option. \"If Russia is heavily attacked conventionally, yes, of course, as it's written in the doctrine, there may be limited use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons,\" he said. \"To show intention, as a de-escalating factor.\" It is difficult to imagine a more dangerous idea in the world of military planning today than of a \"limited\" nuclear war. Scholars have debated for decades, and still debate today, whether the concept of limited nuclear war is realistic, or whether such a conflict would inevitably spiral into total nuclear war. Put another way, no one knows for sure whether Russia's military planners have sown the seeds for global nuclear destruction. Seen from the Russian side, it is at least possible to imagine how this doctrine might make sense: The threat of NATO's conventional forces is widely seen as both overwhelming and imminent, making such an extreme step worth considering. Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia's strategic culture has increasingly emphasized its nuclear arsenal, the one remaining legacy of its fearsome great-power status. It is a sort of Russian cult of the nuclear weapon, or even a certain strategic fetish. With nukes so central to Russian strategic thinking, it is little wonder Moscow sees them as the solution to its greatest strategic problem. But when you consider this doctrine from the American side, you begin to see what makes it dangerous, even insane. Imagine that you are an American leader and your forces in Eastern Europe have somehow been drawn into conflict with the Russians. Perhaps, as artillery and planes from within Russia hammer your forces, you counterattack on Russian soil to take them out. The Kremlin, fearing the start of an invasion to take Moscow, drops a tactical nuclear warhead on your forces in Estonia or Latvia. You have no idea whether more Russian nuclear strikes are coming, either on the battlefield, more widely on Europe, or even against Washington or New York. Do you respond with an in-kind tactical nuclear strike, opening the risk of gradual escalation to total nuclear war? Do you, fearing the worst, move to take out the Russian leadership before they can order more attacks? Or do you announce a unilateral ceasefire, drawing your forces back in humiliation, rewarding Russia with a victory? Russia's nuclear doctrine is betting that any American leader — not to mention the leaders of nuclear-armed France and the UK — would choose the last of those three options. If that prediction turned out to be wrong, it would mean nuclear war, perhaps global nuclear war and thus annihilation. This doctrine, in other words, is gambling with the fate of the world. Such a scenario, to be clear, is remote, a A nuclear conflict with Russia is likelier than you think It was in August 2014 that the real danger began, and that we heard the first warnings of war. That month, unmarked Russian troops covertly invaded eastern Ukraine, where the separatist conflict had grown out of its control. The Russian air force began harassing the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which are members of NATO. The US pledged that it would uphold its commitment to defend those countries as if they were American soil, and later staged military exercises a few hundred yards from Russia's border. Both sides came to believe that the other had more drastic intentions. Moscow is convinced the West is bent on isolating, subjugating, or outright destroying Russia. One in three Russians now believe the US may invade. Western nations worry, with reason, that Russia could use the threat of war, or provoke an actual conflict, to fracture NATO and its commitment to defend Eastern Europe. This would break the status quo order that has peacefully unified Europe under Western leadership, and kept out Russian influence, for 25 years. Fearing the worst of one another, the US and Russia have pledged to go to war, if necessary, to defend their interests in the Eastern European borderlands. They have positioned military forces and conducted chest-thumping exercises, hoping to scare one another down. Putin, warning repeatedly that he would use nuclear weapons in a conflict, began forward-deploying nuclear-capable missiles and bombers. Europe today looks disturbingly similar to the Europe of just over 100 years ago, on the eve of World War I. It is a tangle of military commitments and defense pledges, some of them unclear and thus easier to trigger. Its leaders have given vague signals for what would and would not lead to war. Its political tensions have become military buildups. Its nations are teetering on an unstable balance of power, barely held together by a Cold War–era alliance that no longer quite applies. If you take a walk around Washington or a Western European capital today, there is no feeling of looming catastrophe. The threats are too complex, with many moving pieces and overlapping layers of risk adding up to a larger danger that is less obvious. People can be forgiven for not seeing the cloud hanging over them, for feeling that all is well — even as in Eastern Europe they are digging in for war. But this complacency is itself part of the problem, making the threat more difficult to foresee, to manage, or, potentially, to avert. There is a growing chorus of political analysts, arms control experts, and government officials who are sounding the alarm, trying to call the world's attention to its drift toward disaster. The prospect of a major war, even a nuclear war, in Europe has become thinkable, they warn, even plausible. What they describe is a threat that combines many of the hair-trigger dangers and world-ending stakes of the Cold War with the volatility and false calm that preceded World War I — a comparison I heard with disturbing frequency. They describe a number of ways that an unwanted but nonetheless major war, like that of 1914, could break out in the Eastern European borderlands. The stakes, they say, could not be higher: the post–World War II peace in Europe, the lives of thousands or millions of Eastern Europeans, or even, in a worst-case scenario that is remote but real, the nuclear devastation of the planet. [Update, Nov. 24: If you're reading this in response to Turkey reportedly shooting down a Russian warplane today, read here for why that incident will not lead to war, and why it's very different from the scenarios described in this story.] Everyone in Moscow tells you that if you want to understand Russia's foreign policy and its view of its place the world, the person you need to talk to is Fyodor Lukyanov. Sober and bespectacled, with an academic's short brown beard, Lukyanov speaks with the precision of a political scientist but the occasional guardedness of someone with far greater access than your average analyst. Widely considered both an influential leader and an unofficial interpreter of Russia's foreign policy establishment, Lukyanov is chief of Russia's most important foreign policy think tank and its most important foreign policy journal, both of which reflect the state and its worldview. He is known to be close to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Fyodor Lukyanov speaks at a 2014 conference in London. (Anthony Harvey/Getty Images for The New York Times) I met Lukyanov around the corner from the looming Foreign Ministry compound (his office is nearby), at a small, bohemian cafe in Moscow that serves French and Israeli food to a room packed with gray suits. He was candid and relaxed. When the discussion turned to the risks of war, he grew dire. \"The atmosphere is a feeling that war is not something that’s impossible anymore,\" Lukyanov told me, describing a growing concern within Moscow's foreign policy elite. \"A question that was absolutely impossible a couple of years ago, whether there might be a war, a real war, is back,\" he said. \"People ask it.\" Read the full interview with Fyodor Lukyanov I asked how this had happened. He said that regular Russian people don't desire war, but rather feared it would become necessary to defend against the implacably hostile United States. \"The perception is that somebody would try to undermine Russia as a country that opposes the United States, and then we will need to defend ourselves by military means,\" he explained. Such fears, vague but existential, are everywhere in Moscow. Even liberal opposition leaders I met with, pro-Western types who oppose Putin, expressed fears that the US posed an imminent threat to Russia's security. I had booked my trip to Moscow in December, hoping to get the Russian perspective on what were, at the time, murmurings among a handful of political and arms control analysts that conflict could come to Europe. By the time I arrived in the city, in late April, concerns of an unintended and potentially catastrophic war had grown unsettlingly common. Lukyanov, pointing to the US and Russian military buildups along Eastern Europe, also worried that an accident or provocation could be misconstrued as a deliberate attack and lead to war. In the Cold War, he pointed out, both sides had understood this risk and installed political and physical infrastructure — think of the \"emergency red phone\" — to manage tensions and prevent them from spiraling out of control. That infrastructure is now gone. \"All those mechanisms were disrupted or eroded,\" he said. \"That [infrastructure] has been degraded since the end of the Cold War because the common perception is that we don’t need it anymore.\" That the world does not see the risk of war hanging over it, in other words, makes that risk all the likelier. For most Americans, such predictions sound improbable, even silly. But the dangers are growing every week, as are the warnings. \"One can hear eerie echoes of the events a century ago that produced the catastrophe known as World War I,\" Harvard professor and longtime Pentagon adviser Graham Allison — one of the graybeards of American foreign policy — wrote in a May cover story for the National Interest, co-authored with Russia analyst Dimitri Simes. Their article, \"Russia and America: Stumbling to War,\" warned that an unwanted, full-scale conflict between the US and Russia was increasingly plausible. In Washington, the threat feels remote. It does not in Eastern Europe. Baltic nations, fearing war, have already begun preparing for it. So has Sweden: \"We see Russian intelligence operations in Sweden — we can't interpret this in any other way — as preparation for military operations against Sweden,\" a Swedish security official announced in March. In May, Finland's defense ministry sent letters to 900,000 citizens — one-sixth of the population — telling them to prepare for conscription in case of a \"crisis situation.\" Lithuania has reinstituted military conscription. Poland, in June, appointed a general who would take over as military commander in case of war. Though Western publics remain blissfully unaware, and Western leaders divided, many of the people tasked with securing Europe are treating conflict as more likely. In late April, NATO and other Western officials gathered in Estonia, a former Soviet republic and NATO member on Russia's border that Western analysts most worry could become ground zero for a major war with Russia. At the conference, Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow spoke so openly about NATO's efforts to prepare for the possibility of Russia launching a limited nuclear strike in Europe that, according to the journalist Ahmed Rashid, who was in attendance, he had to be repeatedly reminded he was speaking on the record. One of the scenarios Vershbow said NATO was outlining, according to Rashid's paraphrase, was that Russia could \"choose to use a tactical weapon with a small blast range on a European city or a Western tank division.\" A few weeks later, the Guardian reported that NATO is considering plans to \"upgrade\" its nuclear posture in Europe in response to Russia's own nuclear saber-rattling. One proposal: for NATO's military exercises to include more nuclear weapons use, something Russia already does frequently. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu visit military exercises in Kirillovsky. (MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV/AFP/Getty) Should the warnings prove right, and a major war break out in Europe between Russia and the West, then the story of that war, if anyone is still around to tell it, will begin with Russian President Vladimir Putin trying to solve a problem. That problem is this: Putin's Russia is weak. It can no longer stand toe to toe with the US. It no longer has Europe divided in a stalemate; rather, it sees the continent as dominated by an ever-encroaching anti-Russian alliance. In the Russian view, the country's weakness leaves it at imminent risk, vulnerable to a hostile West bent on subjugating or outright destroying Russia as it did to Iraq and Libya. This is made more urgent for Putin by his political problems at home. In 2012, during his reelection, popular protests and accusations of fraud weakened his sense of political legitimacy. The problem worsened with Russia's 2014 economic collapse; Putin's implicit bargain with the Russian people had been that he would deliver economic growth and they would let him erode basic rights. Without the economy, what did he have to offer them? Putin's answer has been to assert Russian power beyond its actual strength — and, in the process, to recast himself as a national hero guarding against foreign enemies. Without a world-power-class military or economy at his disposal, he is instead wielding confusion and uncertainty — which Soviet leaders rightly avoided as existential dangers — as weapons against the West. Unable to overtly control Eastern Europe, he has fomented risks and crises there, sponsoring separatists in Ukraine and conducting dangerous military activity along NATO airspace and coastal borders, giving Russia more leverage there. Reasserting a Russian sphere of influence over Eastern Europe, he apparently believes, will finally give Russia security from the hostile West — and make Russia a great power once more. Knowing his military is outmatched against the Americans, he is blurring the distinction between war and peace, deploying tactics that exist in, and thus widen, the gray between: militia violence, propaganda, cyberattacks, under a new rubric the Russian military sometimes calls \"hybrid war.\" Unable to cross America's red lines, Putin is doing his best to muddy them — and, to deter the Americans, muddying his own. Turning otherwise routine diplomatic and military incidents into games of high-stakes chicken favors Russia, he believes, as the West will ultimately yield to his superior will. To solve the problem of Russia's conventional military weakness, he has dramatically lowered the threshold for when he would use nuclear weapons, hoping to terrify the West such that it will bend to avoid conflict. In public speeches, over and over, he references those weapons and his willingness to use them. He has enshrined, in Russia's official nuclear doctrine, a dangerous idea no Soviet leader ever adopted: that a nuclear war could be winnable. Putin, having recast himself at home as a national hero standing up to foreign enemies, is more popular than ever. Russia has once more become a shadow hanging over Eastern Europe, feared and only rarely bowed to, but always taken seriously. Many Western Europeans, asked in a poll whether they would defend their own Eastern European allies from a Russian invasion, said no. Russia's aggression, born of both a desire to reengineer a European order that it views as hostile and a sense of existential weakness that justifies drastic measures, makes it far more willing to accept the dangers of war. As RAND's F. Stephen Larrabee wrote in one of the increasingly urgent warnings that some analysts are issuing, \"The Russia that the United States faces today is more assertive and more unpredictable — and thus, in many ways, more dangerous — than the Russia that the United States confronted during the latter part of the Cold War.\" Joseph Nye, the dean of Harvard University's school of government and one of America's most respected international relations scholars, pointed out that Russia's weakness-masking aggression was yet another disturbing parallel to the buildup to World War I. \"Russia seems doomed to continue its decline — an outcome that should be no cause for celebration in the West,\" Nye wrote in a recent column. \"States in decline — think of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 — tend to become less risk-averse and thus much more dangerous.\" The Cold War was a dangerous game, but it was a game in which everyone knew and agreed upon the stakes and the rules. That is not the case today. The Western side believes it is playing a game where the rules are clear enough, the stakes relatively modest, and the competition easily winnable. The Russian side, however, sees a game where the rules can be rewritten on the fly, even the definition of war itself altered. For Russia, fearing a threat from the West it sees as imminent and existential, the stakes are unimaginably high, justifying virtually any action or gamble if it could deter defeat and, perhaps, lead to victory. Separately, the ever-paranoid Kremlin believes that the West is playing the same game in Ukraine. Western support for Ukraine's government and efforts to broker a ceasefire to the war there, Moscow believes, are really a plot to encircle Russia with hostile puppet states and to rob Russia of its rightful sphere of influence. Repeated Russian warnings that it would go to war to defend its perceived interests in Ukraine, potentially even nuclear war, are dismissed in most Western capitals as bluffing, mere rhetoric. Western leaders view these threats through Western eyes, in which impoverished Ukraine would never be worth risking a major war. In Russian eyes, Ukraine looks much more important: an extension of Russian heritage that is sacrosanct and, as the final remaining component of the empire, a strategic loss that would unacceptably weaken Russian strength and thus Russian security. Both side are gambling and guessing in the absence of a clear understanding of what the other side truly intends, how it will act, what will and will not trigger the invisible triplines that would send us careening into war. During the Cold War, the comparably matched Western and Soviet blocs prepared for war but also made sure that war never came. They locked Europe in a tense but stable balance of power; that balance is gone. They set clear red lines and vowed to defend them at all costs. Today, those red lines are murky and ill-defined. Neither side is sure where they lie or what really happens if they are crossed. No one can say for sure what would trigger war. That is why, analysts will tell you, today's tensions bear far more similarity to the period before World War I: an unstable power balance, belligerence over peripheral conflicts, entangling military commitments, disputes over the future of the European order, and dangerous uncertainty about what actions will and will not force the other party into conflict. Today's Russia, once more the strongest nation in Europe and yet weaker than its collective enemies, calls to mind the turn-of-the-century German Empire, which Henry Kissinger described as \"too big for Europe, but too small for the world.\" Now, as then, a rising power, propelled by nationalism, is seeking to revise the European order. Now, as then, it believes that through superior cunning, and perhaps even by proving its might, it can force a larger role for itself. Now, as then, the drift toward war is gradual and easy to miss — which is exactly what makes it so dangerous. But there is one way in which today's dangers are less like those before World War I, and more similar to those of the Cold War: the apocalyptic logic of nuclear weapons. Mutual suspicion, fear of an existential threat, armies parked across borders from one another, and hair-trigger nuclear weapons all make any small skirmish a potential armageddon. In some ways, that logic has grown even more dangerous. Russia, hoping to compensate for its conventional military forces' relative weakness, has dramatically relaxed its rules for using nuclear weapons. Whereas Soviet leaders saw their nuclear weapons as pure deterrents, something that existed precisely so they would never be used, Putin's view appears to be radically different. Russia's official nuclear doctrine calls on the country to launch a battlefield nuclear strike in case of a conventional war that could pose an existential threat. These are more than just words: Moscow has repeatedly signaled its willingness and preparations to use nuclear weapons even in a more limited war. This is a terrifyingly low bar for nuclear weapons use, particularly given that any war would likely occur along Russia's borders and thus not far from Moscow. And it suggests Putin has adopted an idea that Cold War leaders considered unthinkable: that a \"limited\" nuclear war, of small warheads dropped on the battlefield, could be not only survivable but winnable. \"It’s not just a difference in rhetoric. It’s a whole different world,\" Bruce G. Blair, a nuclear weapons scholar at Princeton, told the Wall Street Journal. He called Putin's decisions more dangerous than those of any Soviet leader since 1962. \"There’s a low nuclear threshold now that didn’t exist during the Cold War.\" Nuclear theory is complex and disputable; maybe Putin is right. But many theorists would say he is wrong, that the logic of nuclear warfare means a \"limited\" nuclear strike is in fact likely to trigger a larger nuclear war — a doomsday scenario in which major American, Russian, and European cities would be targets for attacks many times more powerful than the bombs that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even if a nuclear war did somehow remain limited and contained, recent studies suggest that environmental and atmospheric damage would cause a \"decade of winter\" and mass crop die-outs that could kill up to 1 billion people in a global famine. In September of last year, President Obama traveled to Estonia, a nation of 1.3 million people that most Americans have never heard of, and pledged that the United States would if necessary go to war with Russia to defend it. Estonia, along with Latvia and Lithuania — together known as the Baltic states — are at the far edge of Eastern Europe, along Russia's border. They were formerly part of the Soviet Union. And they are where many Western analysts fear World War III is likeliest to start. These small countries are \"the most likely front line of any future crisis,\" according to Stephen Saideman, an international relations professor at Carleton University. Allison and Simes, in their essay warning of war, called the Baltics \"the Achilles’ heel of the NATO alliance.\" A full quarter of Estonia's population is ethnically Russian. Clustered on the border with Russia, this minority is served by the same Russian state media that helped stir up separatist violence among Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. But unlike Ukraine, the Baltic states are all members of NATO, whose charter states that an attack on one member is an attack on them all. Whereas a Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Western sanctions, a Russian invasion of Estonia would legally obligate the US and most of Europe to declare war on Moscow. \"We'll be here for Estonia. We will be here for Latvia. We will be here for Lithuania. You lost your independence once before. With NATO, you will never lose it again,\" Obama pledged in his September speech in Estonia. President Obama pledges the US will defend Estonia while in the Estonian capital of Tallinn. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty) Less than 48 hours after Obama's address, Russian agents blanketed an Estonia-Russia border crossing with tear gas, stormed across, and kidnapped an Estonian state security officer, Eston Kohver, who specialized in counterintelligence. Kohver has been held illegally in a Russian prison for nine months now. It was something like an act of geopolitical trolling: aggressive enough to assert Russian dominion over Estonia, but not so aggressive as to be considered a formal act of war that would trigger a Western counterattack. And it was one of several signs that Putin's Russia is asserting a right to meddle in these former Soviet territories. The Russian military has already begun pressing the Baltic states. Russian warships were spotted in Latvian waters 40 times in 2014. Russian military flights over the Baltics are now routine, often with the planes switching off their transponders, which makes them harder to spot and increases the chances of an accident. Military activity in the region had reached Cold War levels. NATO, fearing the worst, is increasing military exercises in the Baltics. The US is installing heavy equipment. And in February, the US military paraded through the Russian-majority Estonian city of Narva, a few hundred yards from Russia's borders. It's a textbook example of what political scientists call the security dilemma: Each side sees its actions as defensive and the other side's as offensive. Each responds to the other's perceived provocations by escalating further, a self-reinforcing cycle that can all too easily lead to war. It is considered, for example, a major contributor to the outbreak of World War I. That it is entirely foreseeable does little to reduce the risk. Even if Russia in fact has no designs on the Baltics, its bluffing and posturing has already created the conditions for an unwanted war. In early April, for example, a Russian fighter jet crossed into the Baltic Sea and \"buzzed\" a US military plane, missing it by only 20 feet. It was one of several recent near-misses that, according to a think tank called the European Leadership Institute, have had a \"high probability of causing casualties or a direct military confrontation between Russia and Western states.\" Meanwhile, Russia has been flying its nuclear-capable strategic bombers along NATO airspace, often with the planes' transponders switched off, making an accident or misperception more likely. As if that weren't dangerous enough, the bombers — hulking, decades-old Tupolev Tu-95 models — have become prone to accidents such as engine fires. What if a Tu-95 went down unexpectedly, say, off the coast of Norway? What if it was carrying nuclear warheads, or it went down during a moment of high tension? Such incidents can lead to misunderstandings, and such misunderstandings can lead to war. By late April, when NATO officials gathered at the security conference in Estonia's capital of Tallinn, the severity of the danger had become unmistakable. As Ahmed Rashid wrote from the conference: Baltic presidents and NATO officials were unusually blunt in describing the extent to which the security architecture in Eastern Europe has collapsed, how Russia poses the gravest threat to peace since World War II, and how the conflict in Ukraine and the loss of the Crimea has left the Baltic states on the front line of an increasingly hostile standoff. Amid these tensions, the thought of a plane crash leading to war seems scarily plausible. It is not just Western officials who fear such an incident could spark war. Fyodor Lukyanov, the prominent Russian analyst who is considered close to the government, worried that the NATO military exercises in the Baltics meant to deter Russia were also contributing to the problem. \"Russia reacts to that because Russia perceives it as a hostile approach to the Russian border,\" he explained. \"And it’s a vicious circle.\" It is easy to imagine, Lukyanov said, any number of ways that the powder keg could explode. \"Without any intention to create the big conflict, it might happen,\" he said. \"One step, another step, and reciprocity can become very dangerous. Say a Russian aircraft comes very close to an area that NATO believes is prohibited while Russia believes it’s not prohibited, and then British aircraft respond. It might be manageable, and in most cases of course it will be, but who knows.\" It was Andrei Piontkovsky, a Russian political analyst and frequent Kremlin critic, who first suggested the theory, last August, that Putin's plan for the Baltics was more sophisticated, and more calculated, than anybody realized. Piontkovsky was trying to answer a question that Western analysts and policymakers had been puzzling over since Russian provocations began in the Baltics last fall: What does Putin want? Unlike in Ukraine, with which Russia has a long shared history, there is little demand among the Russian public for intervention in the Baltic states. They are of modest strategic value. And the risks of Russia's aggression there are potentially catastrophic. Why bother? His is a theory that is now taken much more seriously by Western policymakers — and appears more plausible all the time. Andrei Piontkovsky at his home in Moscow. Amanda Taub Putin hopes to spark a conflict in the Baltics, Piontkovsky wrote, so as to force Western European leaders into an impossible choice: Fulfill their NATO obligation to defend the Baltics and counterattack, even if it means fighting World War III over a tiny post-Soviet republic most Europeans couldn't care less about — or do nothing. The implications of doing nothing, Piontkovsky pointed out, would extend far beyond the Baltics. It would lay bare NATO's mutual defense provision as a lie, effectively dissolving the military alliance, ending a quarter-century of Europe's security unification under Western leadership, and leaving Eastern Europe once more vulnerable to Russian domination. In this way, Putin could do what Soviet leaders never came close to: defeat NATO. \"This is his most cherished objective,\" Piontkovsky told me when we talked in his kitchen, in a leafy Moscow neighborhood across the river from Gorky Park. \"It's an enormous temptation. He may retreat at any stage, but the temptation is enormous, to destroy NATO. ... The risk is big, yes? But the prize is enormous.\" \"To destroy NATO, to demonstrate that Article V does not work, the Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia are the best place for this,\" he said. \"It's happening now, every day. Intrusions into the airspace, psychological pressure, the propaganda on TV.\" He suggested that Putin, rather than rolling Russian tanks across the border, would perhaps seed unmarked Russian special forces into, say, the Russian-majority city of Narva in Estonia, where they would organize localized violence or a phony independence referendum. A handful of such unacknowledged forces, whom Putin referred to as \"little green men\" after they appeared in Crimea, would perhaps be dressed as local volunteers or a far-right gang; they might be joined by vigilantes, as they were in eastern Ukraine. They would almost certainly be aided by a wave of Russian propaganda, making it harder for outsiders to differentiate unmarked Russian troops from civilian volunteers, to determine who was fighting where and had started what. Such an intervention would force NATO into an impossible choice: Are you really going to open fire on some hoodlums stirring up trouble in Estonia, knowing they might actually be unmarked Russian troops? Would you risk the first major European war since 1945, all to eject some unmarked Russian troops from the Estonian town of Narva? Putin, Piontkovsky believes, is gambling that the answer is no. That NATO would not intervene, thus effectively abandoning its commitment to defend its Eastern European member states. Piontkovsky's scenario, once considered extreme, is now widely seen by Western security experts and policymakers as plausible. At the end of 2014, the military intelligence service of Denmark, a member of NATO, issued a formal paper warning of precisely that: Russia may attempt to test NATO’s cohesion by engaging in military intimidation of the Baltic countries, for instance with a threatening military build-up close to the borders of these countries and simultaneous attempts of political pressure, destabilization and possibly infiltration. Russia could launch such an intimidation campaign in connection with a serious crisis in the post-Soviet space or another international crisis in which Russia confronts the United States and NATO. \"The concern is that what Putin wants to do is break NATO, and the best way to do that would be to poach on the Baltics,\" Saideman, the political scientist, told me on a call from a European security conference where he said the scenario was being taken very seriously. \"And if Germany doesn’t respond to incursions in the Baltics, if France doesn’t respond and it’s just an American operation, then it will lead to the breaking of NATO, is the theory,\" he said. \"That’s the biggest concern.\" Saideman described a variation on this scenario that I heard from others as well: that Putin might attempt to seize some small sliver of the Baltics quickly and bloodlessly. This would make it politically easier for Western European leaders to do nothing — how to rally your nation to war if hardly anyone has even been killed? — and harder to counterattack, knowing it would require a full-scale invasion. \"I think they’re very serious about this,\" Saideman said. \"There’s a real concern.\" A Ukrainian soldier stands watch near the front lines with pro-Russian separatist rebels. (MANU BRABO/AFP/Getty) In early 2015, Pew pollsters asked citizens of several NATO states the exact question that analysts and policymakers from Washington to Moscow are gaming out: \"If Russia got into a serious military conflict with one of its neighboring countries that is our NATO ally, do you think our country should or should not use military force to defend that country?\" The numbers from Western Europe were alarming: Among Germans, only 38 percent said yes; 58 percent said no. If it were up to German voters — and to at least some extent, it is — NATO would effectively surrender the Baltics to Russia in a conflict. This poll is even worse than it looks. It assumes that Russia would launch an overt military invasion of the Baltics. What would actually happen is something far murkier, and far more likely to leverage European hesitation: the playbook from Ukraine, where Russia deployed its newly developed concepts of postmodern \"hybrid war,\" designed to blur the distinction between war and not-war, to make it as difficult as possible to differentiate grassroots unrest or vigilante cyberattacks from Russian military aggression. Putin may already be laying the groundwork. In March of 2014,",

If it weren't for 77,744 voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court would have had, for the first time in nearly 50 years, a majority of Democratic-appointed justices. Ever since Abe Fortas’s resignation in 1969, the Court has either been split down the middle or, more often, made up primarily of Republican appointees. Some of those Republican appointees nonetheless turned out to be liberals, but even taking that into account, the Court hasn’t been majority liberal since 1971, when William Rehnquist and Lewis Powell joined. That hasn’t stopped the Court from evolving in a progressive direction at times. In 1973, GOP appointee Harry Blackmun authored Roe v. Wade, drawing only two dissents; from 1996’s Romer v. Evans to 2015’s Obergefell v. Hodges, Anthony Kennedy and the Court’s liberals steadily expanded the rights of LGBTQ Americans. But for the most part, over the past half-century liberals have been playing defense as an organized and well-planned movement of conservatives has limited the scope of rights trumpeted by liberals, expanded the power of the state in criminal justice, and issued more business-friendly rulings on campaign finance and regulatory issues. The Court ruled that states didn't have to give poor black and Latino school districts the same funding as rich white districts. It ruled that school resegregation achieved through white flight to wealthy suburbs was just fine. It ruled that despite declaring abortion a fundamental right, that didn’t mean Medicaid had to extend that right to poor women, and then it reversed course on treating abortion as a fundamental right at all. It struck down the death penalty but then brought it back four years later. And in more recent years, it’s gutted the Voting Rights Act, struck down limits on campaign donations by corporations, strangled Medicaid expansion in the crib, and, for the first time in American history, declared an individual right to own guns. All that could've changed — if Hillary Clinton had won. The unfilled vacancy of Antonin Scalia’s seat combined with a Hillary Clinton victory in November would've set the Court on a new course. Merrick Garland, nominated by Barack Obama, never got a vote. But though Senate Republicans denied they’d confirm him in the lame-duck session, had Hillary Clinton won they might have been tempted to confirm him lest she name a more liberal nominee. Either way, the result would be a moderate to liberal justice in Scalia’s seat, moving the Court appreciably to the left. Clinton also stood a good chance of replacing the moderate-to-conservative Anthony Kennedy (who just announced his retirement) with a reliable liberal, and keeping Ruth Bader Ginsburg (85 and a two-time cancer survivor) and Stephen Breyer’s (79) seats in liberal hands. The result would be a solid 6-3 liberal majority of a kind not seen in many decades. The implications of such a shift are massive. The Court is not a legislative body, and it can’t simply undo all of the conservative rulings of recent decades. The doctrine of stare decisis means the Court tries not to contradict its past rulings except in rare cases. But after speaking to a number of prominent legal scholars and experts, it appears there are some notable areas where a liberal Court could've made a significant difference. A liberal Court could've ended long-term solitary confinement. It could have mandated better prison conditions in general, making it more costly to maintain mass incarceration. It could have conceivably ended the death penalty. It could have upheld tough state campaign finance rules and started to move away from Citizens United. It could have started to develop a robust right to vote and limited gerrymandering. It could have strengthened abortion rights, moving toward viewing abortion rights as a matter of equal protection for women. But because Donald Trump won, this is all moot. Let’s start with perhaps the biggest thing that could've happened under a liberal Court, perhaps even a Court where another conservative replaces Scalia: the end of long-term solitary confinement. In 2015, Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion in Davis v. Ayala, a death penalty case in which the Court (joined by Kennedy) sided against the defendant. Nevertheless, Kennedy used his concurrence to unleash a bracing jeremiad against the evils of solitary confinement, in which the defendant had been held for most of his more than 25 years in prison. \"Research still confirms what this Court suggested over a century ago: Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price,\" Kennedy wrote. \"In a case that presented the issue, the judiciary may be required, within its proper jurisdiction and authority, to determine whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them.\" The implication was clear: Kennedy wanted advocates to bring a case challenging the constitutionality of long-term solitary confinement on the grounds that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. He basically dared them to, and suggested that if such a case reached the Court, he’d be inclined to limit the practice. With four reliable liberals already on the Court and likely to join him, it’s quite likely that such a case would end with solitary confinement sharply limited. Sharon Dolovich, a law professor at UCLA and faculty director of the university’s Prison Law & Policy Program, describes solitary confinement as the \"one major unresolved issue\" in criminal justice \"that is definitely going to come up\" in the next few years. It’s a long time coming. At any given moment, about 80,000 to 100,000 people are held in solitary confinement in the US; in many states, the average stint in solitary lasts years. And it’s been that way at least since the 1980s, without any federal court intervention to halt it. \"There has not been one federal court that has affirmatively found extended solitary confinement to be per se unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment,\" Dolovich recalls. \"And that is in spite of the fact that even under the relatively unprotective Eighth Amendment doctrine, there is no question that solitary confinement is unconstitutional.\" That doctrine, Dolovich explains, requires plaintiffs alleging a constitutional violation to show that prison officials were \"deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm,\" or \"deliberately indifferent to a basic human need.\" The Court has equated deliberate indifference with a recklessness standard, which requires that prison administrators know there’s a risk that what they’re doing could seriously harm the prisoner. \"Given what everybody knows about solitary confinement, that would be easy to show,\" Dolovich says. Then the plaintiff must show there’s a substantial risk of serious harm, or of being deprived of a basic human need, due to solitary confinement. \"There’s so much data now — physiological data, psychological data, reentry data — there’s so much data making clear the extended physical, psychological, and emotional trauma that people suffer in extended solitary confinement, it would be so easy for the Court just to point to it all and conclude there’s an objective harm,\" Dolovich says. Were the Supreme Court to strike down or limit long-term solitary confinement in one case on those grounds, it would open the door for lower courts to honor additional challenges, eventually leading to change across the system. And it wouldn’t require rethinking Eighth Amendment doctrine to be more friendly to prisoners. Jonathan Simon, a law professor and director of the Center for the Study of Law and Society at UC Berkeley, agrees that solitary confinement is on \"the verge of being found unconstitutional, at least in its most excessive forms.\" Just what \"excessive\" means there is, naturally, a matter of debate, and Simon cautions that the Court could err on the side of giving prisons too much leeway. He notes that Ashker v. Brown, a recent case challenging solitary confinement in California that ended in a settlement rather than reaching the Supreme Court, \"involved a class of inmates that had been held more than 10 years, and the settlement will still allow people to be held up to five years, and even after that they can still be held in solitary if they’re given programming and special services.\" By contrast, the United Nations special rapporteur on torture has called for an absolute ban on solitary confinement lasting 15 days or more. \"I’m not sure Kennedy or any justice would go nearly that far,\" Simon says. But even if the Court were to only place a five-year maximum on periods in solitary confinement, that would be a significant step forward. If the Court is bold enough to accept the UN standard and place a hard two-week limit, then tens of thousands of prisoners would be spared a truly devastating punishment that many medical experts believe to be a form of torture. Solitary confinement is perhaps the most shockingly cruel condition of imprisonment in the United States, but the sheer scale of mass incarceration is also an issue in need of addressing. And because federal courts have the ability to affect policy at both the federal and state level, they can have considerable influence on the incarceration rate going forward. Both Dolovich and Simon were skeptical that outright challenges to legislative sentencing statutes like mandatory minimums could prevail. \"At the end of the day, the ability of courts to control the level of incarceration is relatively weak compared to legislatures who can change the underlying sentencing structure,\" Simon warns. But one thing the Court can do is raise the cost of incarceration by insisting upon prisoners' rights to humane conditions. The most encouraging recent Supreme Court decision along these lines was Brown v. Plata, a 5-4 ruling in 2011 upholding a lower court order that California release tens of thousands of prisoners to reduce overcrowding, which the state itself admitted was unconstitutional. It was, Simon notes, \"the first prisoners' rights decision to come down in favor of the prisoner in a long time. It ended mass incarceration in California.\" But the unique circumstances of the case meant it had limited applicability outside the state. In the past, the Court hasn't been particularly willing to accept Eighth Amendment challenges to prison conditions. In Rhodes v. Chapman, an 8-1 decision in 1981, the Court ruled that \"double celling\" (placing two inmates in a space with room for only one) was not cruel and unusual punishment. That effectively ruled out Eighth Amendment challenges to overcrowding in and of itself. Overturning Rhodes seems unlikely, but modifying it with a ruling specifying that people who are seriously ill need better treatment could be possible. And because prisons are, like the country as a whole, aging considerably at the moment, that could have a far-reaching impact. \"The new focus of prison conditions, which could be a real game changer in my view, is the intersection of overcrowding with mental and physical health burdens. The real game changer in terms of the current prison population is how disease-burdened it is,\" Simon says. \"That could be pretty far-reaching because states have to contemplate the consequence of incarcerating so many aging prisoners.\" Dolovich also emphasizes the need to expand prisoners’ procedural ability to challenge their conditions. The 1996 Prison Litigation Reform Act greatly limited prisoners' access to the courts for making complaints about conditions, and the Court could either interpret the law in ways that minimize those limits (as it did in Ross v. Blake) or attempt to strike down provisions of the act. That opens the door to more challenges, including challenges focusing on the intersection of overcrowding and poor prisoner health. \"If you require prisons to be constitutional in this way, it becomes more expensive and burdensome for states to comply,\" Dolovich explains. \"States are going to reduce the incarceration rate.\" One way in which the courts could be more receptive to directly challenging sentences, she says, is by starting to take \"collateral consequences\" into account. That’s the technical term for the myriad ways that criminal convictions, and in particular sex crime convictions, can hamper defendants’ lives in the long term. That includes restrictions on where they can live after they’re released from prison, bans on government employment and benefits like public housing, inclusion on sex offender registries, bans on gun purchases and voting, and so forth. Dolovich outlined one possible example of a challenge incorporating collateral consequences: \"So you’re a 19-year-old boy who’s been convicted of having sex with your 15-year-old girlfriend. You’re convicted of statutory rape, which itself carries huge direct carceral consequences — you go to prison for five years. But not only that; you also have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life, which is a burden in itself and carries innumerable other collateral consequences that come along with the status of being a registered sex offender.\" \"So you bring a claim under Harmelin v. Michigan\" — a 1991 ruling banning \"grossly disproportionate\" sentences — \"claiming the sentence you received is grossly disproportionate to the crime. That’s an incredibly state-friendly standard, and you barely ever win. … But a court committed to including collateral consequences in its thinking about gross disproportionality would realize it’s not just the five years in prison, it’s all of the burdens that someone registered as a sex offender has to follow.\" Almost as explosive as Kennedy's 2015 concurrence was a dissent filed by Stephen Breyer and joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg that same year. The case, Glossip v. Gross, resulted in a 5-4 ruling affirming that the particular drug cocktail Oklahoma currently uses in executions doesn't violate the Eighth Amendment. One dissent, by Sonia Sotomayor and joined by the Court's other three liberals, narrowly argued against the specific drugs. Breyer's dissent took aim at capital punishment as a whole. \"The death penalty, in and of itself, now likely constitutes a legally prohibited ‘cruel and unusual punishment,’\" Breyer concluded. He rests the argument on four premises: a) the Court has ruled that death sentences must be reliably applied only to appropriate cases to be constitutional, and the frequency of wrongful executions shows that the punishment is not reliably applied; b) the punishment is arbitrarily applied, with some \"worst of the worst\" offenders not receiving it and some lesser offenders facing execution; c) wait times between conviction and execution are cruelly long; and d) the decline in the punishment’s usage in the US shows it’s becoming unconstitutionally \"unusual.\" It’s telling that neither Sotomayor nor Elena Kagan, the two other liberals on the Court, joined Breyer’s opinion. And it’s hard to imagine Merrick Garland, who was one of the prosecutors who successfully sought to see Timothy McVeigh executed, declaring his own past actions categorically unconstitutional. But if Garland’s nomination failed and Clinton had picked a less tough-on-crime nominee for Scalia’s seat, or if Kennedy left the Court during her presidency, it’s conceivable there would've existed five votes for outright abolition of the death penalty. \"I would not be surprised to see Sotomayor and Kagan supportive of [abolishing the death penalty],\" Simon says. \"Kennedy is a harder call. The reason I'm somewhat optimistic about including Kennedy goes back to his interest in dignity. The strongest of the opinions in Furman\" — the 1972 case that briefly abolished capital punishment — \"was William Brennan's, and Brennan based it most directly on human dignity. He argued the Eighth Amendment bans any punishment you can't carry out without respecting the dignity of those being punished.\" Kennedy leaned heavily on the importance of dignity in Brown v. Plata, the California prison overcrowding case. Simon even found an early Kennedy opinion from when he was a circuit court judge in the 1970s in which he quoted Brennan’s concurrence in Furman at length. Even if Kennedy doesn’t buy a dignity argument for abolishing the death penalty, Simon suspects he’d be swayed by the issue of delays, which Breyer raised — and which were the entire reason for the prisoner’s stay in solitary confinement that Kennedy assailed in his concurrence last year. \"[Kennedy] came and gave a talk at Berkeley Law about a year and a half ago, and one of my colleagues was rude enough to ask him point blank whether he thought the death penalty was compatible with human dignity,\" Simon recalls. \"Of course he declined to answer, but he said kind of cryptically, ‘Here in California you guys take so long enough to execute people that we may not even need to reach that cliff.’\" One other death penalty–related case Simon thinks the Court could amend or overturn, which could have widespread implication outside this specific issue area, is McCleskey v. Kemp, a 1987 case in which the Court ruled 5-4 that a death sentence for a black defendant could not be overturned due to the state of Georgia's hugely disproportionate imposition of capital punishment on African Americans. The effect of that was to foreclose challenges to the criminal justice system premised on its discriminatory effect — the Court required that plaintiffs show that discrimination was intended, not merely that the system was in effect discriminating against African Americans. \"It's been terrible for equal protection law generally. Criminal justice is run through with very disproportionate racial practices that are very difficult to prove as discrimination,\" Simon says. \"Overturning McCleskey, and a companion case a few years later, could be a really important change agent both in unleashing the potential for trial court challenges to racially disproportionate criminal justice practices of all sorts, and perhaps ending the death penalty in those states where it seems most firmly rooted, like Texas and Florida.\" No Supreme Court action in recent memory has provoked the kind of populist outcry and fury of Citizens United v. FEC, the 2010 case that banned restrictions on corporate and organizational spending on independent campaign activities, opening the door to Super PACs and the considerably reducing limits on corporate influence in elections. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Senate Democrats have all pushed for constitutional amendments to overrule the decision. Clinton promised to \"appoint Supreme Court justices who will protect Americans’ right to vote over the right of billionaires to buy elections,\" and reportedly told her own donors that she would make prospective justices pledge to overturn Citizens United. That’s created the groundwork for a shift away from the ruling’s approach to campaign finance. \"If Citizens United is overturned, it will be because of the sustained efforts of critics in civil society to critique it, educate the public about why it's wrong, and show through local initiatives that alternative reforms are possible,\" Georgetown Law professor David Cole says. But most of the experts I spoke with expressed skepticism that the decision will be overturned outright. The Court rarely reverses rulings explicitly, especially ones made as recently as Citizens United. And more to the point, directly overruling the decision would likely entail a challenge to a campaign finance law identical or very similar to the one at issue in the case. Congress shows little interest in passing such a law, and states similarly lack initiative to do so. That being said, the legal scholars I asked suggested that a more left-leaning Court could subtly undermine Citizens United by upholding distinct campaign finance regulations at the federal and state levels. \"My guess is that [a more liberal court] wouldn't overrule Citizens United in the short run, but that it would narrow the decision and uphold a range of possible regulations of money in the political process,\" Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago and specialist in free speech cases, says. \"Over time, these decisions would significantly erode Citizens United.\" Heather Gerken, a Yale Law professor and expert on law surrounding elections, voting, and federalism, concurs, and suggests one possible line of legal reasoning that cases like this could embrace. \"I think Citizens United can be overturned without even overturning it, something that should appeal to a moderate and careful judge like Judge Garland,\" she explains. \"Citizens United was premised on the idea that independent spending was genuinely independent. If this political cycle has shown us anything, it’s that this premise is flatly wrong … The Court could easily take notice of these facts and license legislators to regulate this spending precisely because it isn’t ‘independent’ in the sense that Citizens United used that term.\" This could greenlight limitations on independent corporate spending of the kind that Citizens United struck down without undermining that decision’s reasoning. That prevents the kind of upheaval in precedent that the Court normally tries to avoid, while still signaling to states and Congress that it’s okay to pursue more aggressive campaign finance regulations. While less popularly reviled than Citizens United, the Roberts Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder was arguably more consequential. The decision struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which contained a formula for deciding which states and counties would have to be subject to \"preclearance,\" a process in which any changes to voting laws they proposed must be run past the Justice Department to make sure they don’t violate the voting rights of minorities. The upshot of the ruling was that the Voting Rights Act could not be easily enforced by the federal government, and instead has to be enforced through individual lawsuits filed after laws are passed, under Section 2 of the act. That’s a much slower, more expensive process that effectively makes it harder to challenge things like voter ID requirements or restrictions on early voting. This is something that’s mainly in Congress’s court. \"There are plenty of ways that Congress could revive [preclearance], and a Court with a liberal majority would be far more welcoming to new legislation,\" Gerken says. \"But, again, the ball is in Congress’s court.\" \"The preclearance regime can't easily be recovered,\" says Pam Karlan, a law professor at Stanford and former deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights specializing in voting rights. At best, she explains, \"the Supreme Court could give a robust reading of Section 2 in the Voting Rights Act,\" and use it to invalidate large categories of franchise-restricting voting regulations. The problem is deeper than Shelby, too. \"The Court has really moved to an ‘undue burden’ standard on the right to vote\" in the past 10 years or so, Karlan explains, \"rather than treating it as a straightforward fundamental rights issue under strict scrutiny.\" Under an undue burden standard, legislation that places some burden on a constitutional right, such as the right to vote, is acceptable, as long as that burden isn't excessive in scale. For example, in Crawford v. Marion County in 2008, the Court ruled that Indiana's photo ID requirement for voters was not an undue burden, because, as Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, \"the inconvenience of going to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, gathering required documents, and posing for a photograph does not qualify as a substantial burden on most voters' right to vote.\" \"Strict scrutiny,\" by contrast, is the toughest test a law can face in court, requiring that it address a government interest that's really compelling, and address it in the least restrictive, narrowest way possible. Voter ID laws would be in trouble with such a regime, not least since the evidence that voter fraud is a major problem, and preventing it is a compelling government interest, is basically nonexistent. But Karlan notes that the Court wouldn’t even have to totally reverse course and start applying strict scrutiny to make progress on these issues. \"One of the things I’ve been thinking about is a more liberal version of the undue burden–style standards that the Court has employed,\" she says. \"A version of that test that really takes into account socioeconomic disparities and the like could have a major impact.\" \"For example, voter ID — it’s not a burden on most people to have a voter ID,\" she continues. \"A huge majority of Americans drive cars and have drivers' licenses. So saying that you need to show your driver’s license to vote for most people is not a burden. But if there’s a group of people that are too poor to own cars, or are disabled in ways that mean they can't drive, for those people getting the documents and going to the DMV and dealing with a system that requires a certain degree of sophistication is a real burden. If courts were to start taking seriously the question of looking at the burden with respect to the people who actually face it, that might change dramatically how the Court thinks about a lot of these issues.\" That’s a particularly promising avenue for the Court since it requires minimal change in the Court’s doctrines. \"It’s not necessarily the legal tests themselves that are the problem,\" Karlan notes. \"It’s the sensibilities and the understandings and the world-awareness of the people applying the tests.\" That’s something that changing the membership of the Court could shift substantially, even if the new Court isn’t eager to overturn precedent. 2016 the strongest Supreme Court verdict affirming reproductive rights in years, as the Court struck down two Texas regulations of abortion clinics in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. One interesting aspect of the Court’s ruling is that Stephen Breyer, the author of the majority opinion, explicitly invoked an \"undue burden\" test. As in voting rights, the Court has decided to evaluate abortion regulations under that metric, rather than treating abortion as a fundamental right that the Court must past a strict test to restrict. In 1992's Planned Parenthod v. Casey decision, a plurality opinion by Sandra Day O'Connor embraced the \"undue burden,\" standard, which has had the effect of allowing a wide number of abortion regulations — bans on late-term abortions, parental consent requirements, waiting periods — that otherwise would’ve been struck down. Indeed, not even a decade earlier, in City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, the Court struck down a waiting period and parental consent requirement and explicitly rejected an argument from O’Connor in the dissent, and from the Reagan administration’s solicitor general, Rex Lee, that they should adopt an undue burden standard that would allow such measures. Once undue burden was adopted, those kinds of provisions were viable for states to pass again. Whole Woman’s Health didn’t abandon the undue burden standard but instead repurposed it, in much the way Karlan suggested, by taking into account things like indirect effects (the closure of clinics due to the regulations, for example) and effects on quality of care and the patient experience of women seeking abortions. A test that had formerly been used to restrict the right to abortion had been retrofitted to protect it. \"It is difficult to say, but my guess is that undue burden will remain the standard going forward, with the focus on exactly how it will be applied, because it is a standard that can be developed to apply to strongly protect against harmful government restrictions on abortion,\" Dawn Johnsen, an expert on abortion law and a professor of law at Indiana University, says. If the Court wanted to make a bigger shift on the issue, it could adopt an argument that Justice Ginsburg has been making for years and start considering abortion as an issue of gender equality. Roe v. Wade asserted a right to abortion based on a right to privacy found in the due process clause of the 14th Amendment; many observers have argued this is a flimsy basis for the right to abortion, and that premising it on the equal protection clause, and arguing that restrictions on abortion unconstitutionally burden women without affecting men, would make for a firmer foundation. In particular, this reevaluation could lead to increased abortion access for poor women. In a number of states, including Connecticut, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Alaska, state constitutional guarantees to equal protection have been used to mandate that Medicaid cover medically necessary abortions. It’s unlikely that the Court will overturn Harris v. McRae, a 1980 case upholding the Hyde Amendment, Congress’s ban on most federal funding for Medicaid abortions, anytime soon. But an equal protection reevaluation of abortion rights is at least somewhat likely, and could lay the groundwork for a right to abortion coverage in the medium to long run. \"​Supreme Court justices increasingly over the years have recognized that the right to choose when and whether to bear children is important not just to their individual liberty but to women's equality,\" Johnsen says. \"I think odds are very good that a majority of justices in the future will hold that the right is protected by the constitutional right to both liberty and equal protection.\" Even outside the issues of imprisonment, capital punishment, elections, gerrymandering, and abortion, there are places where the Court could move. Karlan raises the possibility of a \"civil Gideon\" — a ruling that would create a right to counsel in civil cases, so poor people are guaranteed a lawyer if they need to sue their landlord or their employer; the name comes from Gideon v. Wainwright, which established the right to a government-provided attorney in criminal cases. Hailly Korman, a principal at Bellwether Education Partners and a veteran education attorney, expressed hope that the Court could overturn San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, the 1973 decision that concluded, 5-4, that there was no federal right to education. \"With a liberal majority, I don't think it's implausible,\" Korman explains. \" I think there is a very strong case to be made that some minimum of education is a necessary prerequisite to enable people to access and wield all of their other rights. If I could change one thing about our federal jurisprudence, this would be it.\" Berkeley’s Simon notes that a more liberal Court could push back on past Court decisions about policing expanding the scope of searches and seizures — like Whren v. United States, which Simon alleges \"constitutionalized racial profiling\" by letting police stop cars whenever they want as long as there's probable cause for a traffic violation; or Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, which held that police could arrest people and take them for jail for driving without a seat belt, a crime that can't be punished with jail or prison time — and thus send a signal to police to use less aggressive techniques, particularly in policing communities of color. David Strauss, a professor at University of Chicago Law School, argues that focusing on classic Supreme Court issues that split on liberal/conservative lines (like abortion) distracts from areas of law that might prove to be bigger parts of the Court's jurisprudence, like \"the relationship between free speech and both government secrets and individual privacy,\" and cyber harassment. But even if a small fraction of the changes detailed above had been incorporated into a new, more liberal Court’s jurisprudence, the consequences could've been momentous.

        "articles": "“I’m going to make them a little bit nervous.” In the weeks leading up to the presidential election, Donald Trump has urged his followers to spend time on Election Day intimidating nonwhite voters. He tells them that after they vote on November 8, it’s their duty to go en masse to “some other place” and make sure that no one’s engaging in voter fraud. “Go sit there with your friends and make sure it's on the up-and-up,” he’s said. Trump doesn’t explicitly say the “other place” needs to be somewhere nonwhite people are voting. Sometimes he says “specific areas”; on one occasion, during an appearance in Pennsylvania, he called out Philadelphia. But at least some of his supporters are picking up on the subtext. And some are openly admitting to reporters — like Matt Viser and Tracy Jan of the Boston Globe — that they’re going to engage in some “racial profiling” at the polls, and make supposedly foreign-looking voters “a little bit nervous”: “I’ll look for ... well, it’s called racial profiling. Mexicans. Syrians. People who can’t speak American,” he said. “I’m going to go right up behind them. I’ll do everything legally. I want to see if they are accountable. I’m not going to do anything illegal. I’m going to make them a little bit nervous.” That quote is from a man named Steve Webb who lives in Fairfield, Ohio (a suburb of Cincinnati). That appears to be his real name — or at least, there is a Steve Webb on Facebook who fits that description and is an active Trump supporter. In other words, Webb, to all appearances, isn’t just planning to make voters feel “a little bit nervous” if they “can’t speak American” (i.e., might be noncitizens and might be trying to vote illegally). He is so confident that he’s doing the morally and legally right thing that he was willing to put his name and face to his plan. It’s really hard to overstate how alarming this is. As experts explain in the Boston Globe article, it’s one thing to have election monitors stationed at polling places to make sure poll workers and campaign volunteers aren’t breaking election law; it’s quite another to encourage groups of vigilantes to hang out at polling places in unfamiliar neighborhoods, with the stated goal of making people feel too uncomfortable to vote if they look like they shouldn’t be voting. As Jamelle Bouie wrote this week for Slate, America has a history of Election Day violence. It’s usually racial — in particular, white Americans using violence to suppress the vote of nonwhite Americans. And it has, on occasion, been deadly. The more Trump slips in the polls — the more he’s shunned by the political establishment — the more frequently and ardently he tells his followers that the election is in danger of being rigged, and the more he urges them to stop it. One group of Trump supporters, carrying guns, has already held a “protest” outside a Democratic campaign office in Virginia. And we have weeks left to go. The most urgent danger Donald Trump poses to the public safety of the United States isn’t that he will win, or come close to winning, on Election Day. It’s that he will be so obviously doomed to lose that he’ll fan his supporters into a frenzy and people will get hurt.

        "articles": "The Mueller investigation just got red-hot. The FBI raided the office and hotel room of President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer on Monday as part of a fraud and campaign finance investigation. Hours later, Trump called the raid an “attack on our country” and speculated that “we’ll see what happens” when asked if he planned to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. Significantly, Mueller’s probe has also turned its sights on a $150,000 donation from a Ukrainian billionaire made to Trump’s charity, which previously admitted it violated tax law and helped Trump personally, during the campaign. All of a sudden, Mueller’s Russia investigation is red-hot, and it’s getting much closer to the president. Here’s what you need to know about the past 24 hours of news in Mueller’s investigation into the Trump-Russia scandal. Mueller’s investigation has been looking into Trump’s longtime lawyer Michael Cohen, although the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York carried out the raid. Bloomberg reported that Mueller uncovered potential crimes by Cohen during his Russia investigation, and brought the findings to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein decided to send the case to the New York office, which led the search of Cohen’s office and hotel (his home is undergoing renovation). Under the law, Mueller has to tell Rosenstein about any crimes he uncovers that aren’t directly under the mandate of his investigation. It is then up to Rosenstein decide whether another prosecutor should go after the charges. The raid brings the case closer to Trump’s door than any to date, touching a close Trump confidant — and potentially a speech made by Trump himself. Trump wasn’t pleased and made aggressive comments to the press on Monday evening, right as news broke that Mueller’s team is looking at a donation to Trump’s charity tied to a speech Trump gave during the campaign. Cohen is the man in the middle of the controversy over Stormy Daniels. Daniels, a porn actress, says she had an affair with Trump in 2006. Cohen paid her $130,000 days before the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her keeping quiet about the relationship. The investigation into Cohen is tied to that payment, with legal experts saying he may have violated campaign finance law. If Cohen used the money to keep the affair secret and help Trump win the election, the payoff could be considered a donation — one that violates campaign finance law. Cohen could have been trying to help by keeping an embarrassing story from the press. If that’s the case, the donation was never properly reported to the federal government, and it would substantially exceed the legal cap on donations. The FBI is also looking at whether Cohen violated any banking or wire transfer laws by using a personal bank loan to pay off Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. Cohen’s lawyer, Stephen Ryan, said that the raid was “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and pointed out that attorney-client privilege may shield many of Cohen’s files from investigators, a legal concept that protects communication between lawyers and their clients. But the privilege doesn’t apply if the lawyer is committing a crime. Although it isn’t Mueller’s team that led the search, Trump is directly blaming Mueller, according to the New York Times. The president responded to the raids with some of his most heated criticism of Mueller and his investigation to date. Trump was about to hold a meeting with military leaders at the White House Monday to discuss the situation in Syria when he fielded a string of questions from reporters about the probe and attacked Mueller. “It’s a real disgrace. It’s an attack on our country in a true sense,” Trump said. “It’s an attack on what we all stand for, so when I saw this and when I heard it, I heard it like you did, I said that is really now in a whole new level of unfairness.” Trump repeated his claim that the investigation is a “witch hunt” and declined to answer whether he would now fire Mueller. “We’ll see what happens,” Trump said. “I think it’s disgraceful, and so do a lot of other people.” Trump has toyed with firing Mueller before, but several factors make that a difficult choice, including that Mueller’s investigation could go on without him, and it would likely be politically disastrous. But Mueller just helped build a case against Cohen, and he’s digging into Trump’s personal activities, including a speech paid for by a Ukrainian billionaire. One critical question that the Mueller probe has been looking at is whether foreign money flowed into Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election. That has led Mueller’s team to a speech Trump delivered in September 2016 to a conference in Kiev, Ukraine. Trump filmed a speech and sent a video to the conference, and in exchange, a Ukrainian steel magnate donated $150,000 to Trump’s personal charity, the New York Times reported. Cohen reportedly solicited the donation for Trump, although it is not related to Monday’s raids. Trump’s charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, faced intense scrutiny during the election for spending money on items like a $20,000 portrait of Trump. After the election, the charity admitted that it violated tax law by helping Trump personally. The focus on the speech and the donation is part of Mueller’s growing interest in overseas money and the Trump campaign. Much of Mueller’s case against Paul Manafort is tied to Manafort’s work in Ukraine, and Mueller’s team subpoenaed Trump’s businesses in March looking at Trump’s overseas deals. The payment for a Trump speech brings the investigation to Trump personally. And the focus on Trump’s businesses and business colleagues may have violated Trump’s previous assertions that Mueller shouldn’t look into his companies. Trump’s non-answer as to Mueller’s future on Monday might be a sign that Mueller has to work quickly if he wants to finish his investigation before losing his job.

        "articles": "To prevent more violent uprisings and protests, we need to take their causes seriously. When tensions in Charlotte, North Carolina, over the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott quickly boiled over into violence, looting, and riots, many people on social media had the same reaction: Why are people destroying their own communities in such senseless violence? But this misses the point. This sentiment, experts previously told me, underplays the real anger behind riots and urban uprisings. \"People participate in this type of event for a real reason,\" Darnell Hunt, a UCLA professor who's studied the 1992 Rodney King riots in Los Angeles, said. \"It's not just people taking advantage. It's not just anger and frustration at the immediate or proximate cause. It's always some underlying issues.\" Riots are the culmination of these underlying issues. They might be catalyzed by one particular cause — such as a police shooting — but they're also the result of long-held angers — broader police abuse, residential segregation, economic inequality, and racial tensions, generally, in America. What's more, riots can lead to serious attention and change. We see some of this in media coverage today: When Baltimore burst into riots after Freddie Gray died in police custody, its policing problems received a lot more attention by the press — and even led to a US Justice Department investigation that found a local police department plagued by racist practices. But riots don't just lead to more attention — other urban upheavals in the 1960s and 1990s led to real reforms in local police departments and governments, and the Justice Department is now pushing the Baltimore Police Department into reform following its investigation. This doesn't mean that people should go out into the streets and destroy their communities. But as tensions remain high in Charlotte, Baltimore, and other US cities, acknowledging the lingering rage and feelings of neglect that led to the riots as genuine political viewpoints is important not just to understand what would compel someone to burn down or loot local businesses, but also how to prevent such events from happening again in the future. Historians and experts argue that these types of riots aren't solely random acts of violence or people taking advantage of dire circumstances to steal and destroy property. They are, instead, a serious attempt at forcing change after years of neglect by politicians, media, and the general public. \"All of these politicians that get completely overwhelmed and outraged from this level of chaos in their cities during these upheavals seem surprised,\" Heather Ann Thompson, a historian at the University of Michigan who's studied America's 1960s riots, previously told me. \"Yet … the origins of the upheaval are very much in their control.\" In the 1960s, despite the victories of the civil rights movement, economic disparities and police abuse against black communities culminated in violent demonstrations across the country. Throughout the decade, people rose up in cities like Los Angeles, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. These riots were, like the current protests in Charlotte, triggered by specific catalysts. The 1968 riots in Baltimore — and across the country — were galvanized by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. But they were deeply rooted in discontent with police departments that were predominantly white and neglected and abused black neighborhoods. \"There's a long memory of historical injustice\" \"Almost all of the several hundred riots that happened between 1963 and 1970 were sparked by confrontations between African Americans and the police,\" Thomas Sugrue, a historian at New York University who's also studied the 1960s riots, said. But, he added, \"There's a long memory of historical injustice — going back to slave patrols, to police officers enforcing racial segregation and arresting nonviolent protesters, and the commonplace tension, conflict, and harassment directed at African Americans by law enforcement officials.\" Similarly, in 1992, South Central Los Angeles rose up in riots that lasted six days, killed more than 60 people, and injured thousands. The riots were triggered by the acquittal of police officers who were caught on tape beating Rodney King, a black man, after a high-speed chase. But, Hunt of UCLA explained, the riots were really a culmination of anger in black and Hispanic communities over decades of economic inequality and police abuses in Los Angeles. Previous research found, for example, that high unemployment and poverty in South Central Los Angeles made it a hotbed for violent outbursts. Hunt also said the community was simmering with anger at the time over the recent sentence of Soon Da Ju, a Korean-born shop owner who was sentenced to five years' probation for fatally shooting a black teenager she thought was stealing a bottle of orange juice. \"It was the accumulation of slights and insults and disrespect,\" Hunt said. More recent riots have also been fueled by years of issues, even if they were seemingly catalyzed by a single event. The catalyst for the protests and subsequent riots in Baltimore in April 2015 was Freddie Gray's death and questions about why he was arrested and whether the cops who arrested him caused his fatal spinal cord injury. And in Charlotte, the main catalyst was the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. But there were deeper issues, as well. Gray's West Baltimore neighborhood, for example, has languished in poverty: More than half the residents weren't working and one-third of residential buildings were vacant or abandoned, according to a February 2015 report by the Justice Policy Institute and Prison Policy Initiative. At the same time, the city had to pay $5.7 million in settlements to more than 100 people — most of whom were black — since 2011 over allegations that police abused and beat them, according to a September 2014 report by the Baltimore Sun's Mark Puente. Charlotte, similarly, has long been mired by racially skewed policing and residential segregation. Thompson explained in an op-ed for NBC News: In short, Charlotte is one of the wealthiest cities in the country, but this prosperity hasn't touched overwhelmingly black West and Northeast Charlotte and it is one of the most heavily policed. And the police don't spend much energy policing — throwing people up against cars on a regular basis to search them for drugs — in overwhelmingly white South Charlotte. And the excessive and aggressive policing of only Charlotte's poorest and blackest neighborhoods leads there, as it does in every other city in the country, to the killing of citizens by the police. It has led there, as it has elsewhere to outrage. The anger toward these systems, particularly in black communities, extends outside Baltimore and Charlotte. The Black Lives Matter movement took off following the police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri. Since Brown's death, the rallying call of Black Lives Matter has been pushed in protests for several other police killings — of Eric Garner in New York City, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina. These deaths and many others have fed into the idea in black communities that their own members — or their sons — could be the next victims of police brutality. An analysis of the available FBI data by 's Dara Lind found that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: Black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up 13 percent of the US population. Although the data is incomplete, since it's based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force. Higher crime in black communities doesn't fully explain the disparities. A 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found, \"There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.\" That suggests something else — such as, potentially, racial bias — is going on. But Thompson said it also takes years of neglect, despite peaceful calls for change, for discontent to turn into violence. \"Riots never come first,\" she said. \"They only come after a sustained attempt to change whatever is the problem through other means.\" In the 1960s, people engaged in nonviolent protests as part of the Civil Rights Movement, filed complaints through the NAACP, complained to media, and threatened litigation, Thompson said. In Baltimore, locals complained to media, filed lawsuits over police abuse, and, finally, protested peacefully for weeks before the protests turned violent. In Charlotte, black communities have long complained about mistreatment by police — including, previously, the 2013 police shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed 24-year-old black man who was shot 10 times and killed by a white police officer after he crashed his car. It was only when these attempts at drawing attention to systemic problems failed that demonstrators rose up in violence, including in modern-day Baltimore and Charlotte. \"I was one of the ones who started the peaceful protests … the first seven days [after Gray's death], when it was fine and dandy,\" William Stewart, a West Baltimore resident who didn't participate in the riots, told Jenée Desmond-Harris for . \"I walked about 101 miles in peace. But if you protest peacefully, they don't give a shit.\" A California police officer directs traffic around a shopping center engulfed in flames during the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. (Carlos Schiebeck/AFP via Getty Images) Social justice riots are often depicted as people senselessly destroying their own communities to no productive means. President Barack Obama, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, and members of the media all used this type of characterization to describe the riots in Baltimore. It was a widespread sentiment online after the Charlotte protests, too. But riots can and have led to substantial reforms in the past, indicating that they can be part of a coherent political movement. By drawing attention to some of the real despair in destitute communities, riots can push the public and leaders to initiate real reforms to fix whatever led to the violent rage. \"When you have a major event like this, the power structure has to respond,\" Hunt of UCLA said. \"Some very concrete, material things often come out of these events.\" \"When you have a major event like this, the power structure has to respond\" The 1960s unrest, for example, led to the Kerner Commission, which reviewed the cause of the uprisings and pushed reforms in local police departments. The changes to police ended up taking various forms: more active hiring of minority police officers, civilian review boards of cases in which police use force, and residency requirements that force officers to live in the communities they police. \"This is one of the greatest ironies. People would say that this kind of level of upheaval in the streets and this kind of chaos in the streets is counterproductive,\" Thompson said. \"The fact of the matter is that it was after every major city in the urban north exploded in the 1960s that we get the first massive probe into what was going on — known as the Kerner Commission.\" Sugrue agreed. \"It's safe to say some changes would have happened a lot more slowly had there not been disruptive protests,\" he said. Similarly, in Los Angeles, the 1992 riots led the Los Angeles Police Department to implement reforms that put more emphasis on community policing and diversity. The reforms appear to have worked, to some extent: Surveys from the Los Angeles Times found approval of the LAPD rose from 40 percent in 1991 to 77 percent in 2009 — although approval among Hispanic and black residents was lower, at 76 percent and 68 percent respectively. It's hard to say, but these types of changes might have prevented more riots over policing issues in Los Angeles. \"It's not perfect — far from that,\" Hunt said. \"But it's better.\" Rioting can spur change, but it can also lead to destructive backlash. In the immediate aftermath, riots can scare away investment and business from riot-torn communities. This is something that remains an issue in West Baltimore, where some buildings are still scarred by the 1968 riots. In the long term, they can also motivate draconian policy changes that emphasize law and order above all else. The \"tough on crime\" policies enacted in the 1970s through 1990s are mostly attributed to urban decay brought on by suburbanization, a general rise in crime, and increasing drug use, but Thompson and Sugrue argued that the backlash to the 1960s riots was also partly to blame. \"Riots cut both ways,\" Sugrue said. \"They do give a voice to the voiceless, but they can also lead to consequences that those who are challenging the system don't intend.\" The \"tough on crime\" policies pushed a considerably harsher approach in the criminal justice system, with a goal of deterring crime with the threat of punishment. Police were evaluated far more on how many arrests they carried out, even for petty crimes like loitering. Sentences for many crimes dramatically increased. As a result, levels of incarceration skyrocketed in the US, with black men at far greater risk of being jailed or imprisoned than other segments of the population. The irony is that many of these \"tough on crime\" policies led to the current distrust of police in cities like Baltimore, as David Simon, creator of The Wire and former Baltimore crime reporter, explained to the Bill Keller at the Marshall Project: [I]t's time to make new sergeants or lieutenants, and so you look at the computer and say: Who's doing the most work? And they say, man, this guy had 80 arrests last month, and this other guy's only got one. Who do you think gets made sergeant? And then who trains the next generation of cops in how not to do police work? I've just described for you the culture of the Baltimore police department amid the deluge of the drug war, where actual investigation goes unrewarded and where rounding up bodies for street dealing, drug possession, loitering such — the easiest and most self-evident arrests a cop can make — is nonetheless the path to enlightenment and promotion and some additional pay. So by viewing riots as criminal acts instead of legitimate political displays of anger at systemic failures, the politicians of the 1970s, '80s, and '90s pushed some policies that actually fostered further anger toward police — even as other, positive reforms were simultaneously spurred by urban uprisings. By misunderstanding the purpose of the riots, public officials made events like them more likely. \"By having done that, these communities are far worse off,\" Thompson said. \"The crisis of police brutality, poverty, exploitation, and black citizens not feeling like full citizens have all gotten much, much worse in 40 years.\" We have a request In moments like this — as people grapple to understand variants and vaccines, and kids head back to school — many outlets take their paywalls down. ’s content is always free, in part because of financial support from our readers.

        "articles": "Donald Trump will almost certainly be the Republican nominee after he defeated Ted Cruz in the Indiana primary on Tuesday night. The news, a crippling blow to the #NeverTrump campaign, has sent many conservatives into a panic. On social media, several of them conceded the election to Hillary Clinton. One even declared that he's with Clinton, and another said America is dead. Here are some of the reactions from leading conservatives tonight: \"You may be right, I may be crazy, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for\" turns out to have worked well as a campaign slogan. Congratulate the Trump supporters. Tonight will be their high point. In six months, they'll be blaming the rest of us for their choices. Now commences six months of Trump supporters abjectly begging conservatives to take the blame for their bad decisions. I don’t want to congratulate Hillary Clinton on winning the Presidency tonight, but she just did. Madam President. #ImWithHer The Party Decides to Jump Off a Bridge \"It's over. 100 percent.

        "articles": "No president in recent memory has done more to change the judiciary than Donald Trump. In less than four years as president, President Trump has done nearly as much to shape the courts as President Obama did in eight years. Trump hasn’t simply given lots of lifetime appointments to lots of lawyers. He’s filled the bench with some of the smartest, and most ideologically reliable, men and women to be found in the conservative movement. Long after Trump leaves office, these judges will shape American law — pushing it further and further to the right even if the voters soundly reject Trumpism in 2020. Let’s start with some raw numbers. Both Obama and Trump appointed two justices to the Supreme Court, but Trump’s impact on the highest Court far exceeds Obama’s, because Trump replaced the relatively moderate conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy with the hard-line conservative Brett Kavanaugh (after appointing conservative Neil Gorsuch to fill Antonin Scalia’s vacant seat). Obama’s appointees — Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — largely maintained the balance of power on a conservative Court, while Trump has shoved that Court even further to the right. And that’s not counting Trump Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, who is likely to be confirmed soon. On the courts of appeal, the final word in the overwhelming majority of federal cases, more than one-quarter of active judges are Trump appointees. In less than four years, Trump has named a total of 53 judges to these courts, compared to the 55 Obama appointed during his entire presidency. In their first terms, Obama appointed 30 appellate judges; President George W. Bush filled only 35 seats on the federal appellate bench; President Clinton, 30; President George H.W. Bush, 42; and President Reagan, 33. On the district courts, the lowest level of federal courts, Trump’s impact has been less significant, although he’s still appointed judges far faster than Obama. Obama appointed 268 federal trial judges in eight years, while Trump has appointed 210 so far. But district judges deal far more often with routine matters like individual criminal sentences and trial schedules, and far less often with the kind of blockbuster cases that shape thousands of lives. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in a candid moment while she was still a lower court judge, “the court of appeals is where policy is made.” It’s tempting to assume that Trump’s judicial appointees share the goonish incompetence of the man who placed them on the bench, but this assumption could not be more wrong. His picks include leading academics, Supreme Court litigators, and already prominent judges who now enjoy even more power within the judiciary. Before he became president, Trump promised to delegate the judicial selection process to the Federalist Society, a powerful group of conservative lawyers that counts at least four Supreme Court justices among its members. “We’re going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by the Federalist Society,” Trump told a radio show hosted by the right-wing site Breitbart while he was still a candidate. The Federalist Society spent decades preparing for this moment, and they’ve helped Trump identify many of the most talented conservative stalwarts in the entire legal profession to place on the bench. There’s no completely objective way to measure legal ability, but a common metric used by legal employers to identify the most gifted lawyers is whether those lawyers secured a federal clerkship, including the most prestigious clerkships at the Supreme Court. Approximately 40 percent of Trump’s appellate nominees clerked for a Supreme Court justice, and about 80 percent clerked on a federal court of appeals. That compares to less than a quarter of Obama’s nominees who clerked on the Supreme Court, and less than half with a federal appellate clerkship. In other words, based solely on objective legal credentials, the average Trump appointee has a far more impressive résumé than any past president’s nominees. They’re young, too. “The average age of circuit judges appointed by President Trump is less than 50 years old,” the Trump White House bragged in early November, “a full 10 years younger than the average age of President Obama’s circuit nominees.” Trump’s nominees will serve for years or even decades after being appointed. Even if Democrats crush the 2020 elections and win majorities in both houses of Congress, these judges will have broad authority to sabotage the new president’s agenda. There is simply no recent precedent for one president having such a transformative impact on the courts. In an age of legislative dysfunction, whoever controls the courts controls the country. In the past decade or so — or more precisely, since Republicans took over the House in 2011 — Congress has been barely functional. You can count on one hand, and possibly on just a few fingers, the major legislation it has enacted. Judges, by contrast, have become the most consequential policymakers in the nation. They have gutted America’s campaign finance law and dismantled much of the Voting Rights Act. They have allowed states to deny health coverage to millions of Americans. They’ve held that religion can be wielded as a sword to cut away the rights of others. They’ve drastically watered down the federal ban on sexual harassment. And that barely scratches the surface. The judiciary is where policy is made in the United States. And that policy is likely to be made by Republican judges for the foreseeable future. There are likely now five votes on the Supreme Court, for example, to effectively give the judiciary a veto power over all federal regulations. Similarly, the Court’s decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014) signals that religious conservatives may now ask the judiciary for an exemption from any law — and courts are likely to become quite generous in passing out such exemptions in the coming years. Republicans spent most of 2017 trying and failing to repeal Obamacare — but that failure means little to a federal appeals court that is expected to strike down the Affordable Care Act any day now. And that’s not all. In the coming months, the courts are poised to gut abortion rights, eviscerate gun control, and neuter landmark environmental laws. Federal judges have already stripped workers of their ability to assert many of their rights against their employers, and this process is likely to accelerate in the near future. Many of our voting rights lie in tatters, due to conservative judicial appointments, and this process is likely to accelerate as well. When Congress has been unable to function, the executive branch has relied on existing federal laws that delegate some policymaking authority to federal agencies, in order to deal with many of the nation’s pressing needs. But with the Supreme Court poised to give judges a veto power over these agencies’ actions, the courts could in effect strike down any regulation they dislike. In a Republican-controlled judiciary, this likely means that Republican administrations will retain broad discretionary authority, but Democratic administrations will be hobbled. And here’s the thing: We probably will not fully understand just how much power Trump’s judges will wield until after Trump leaves office. Right now, the executive branch is ideologically aligned with Trump’s judges, so those judges are less likely to object to the Trump administration’s actions than more liberal jurists. But it’s a fairly safe bet that Trump’s judges would spend an Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden administration wreaking havoc on the new president’s agenda — and that any future Democratic president will face similar opposition. Broadly speaking, there are two reasons Trump has had such an outsize influence on the federal courts. The first reason is the effective blockade Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell imposed on appellate court confirmations the moment Republicans took over the Senate. McConnell’s effort to block Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland is well-known. Less well-known are the many lower court nominees who received similar treatment. Under Trump, McConnell has turned the Senate into a machine that churns out judicial confirmations and does little else — he’s ignored literally hundreds of bills passed by the House. Under Obama, by contrast, McConnell’s Senate was the place where judicial nominations went to die. The numbers here speak for themselves. In the final two years of the Obama presidency, when Republicans controlled the Senate, Obama successfully appointed only two federal appellate judges — and one of those judges, Kara Farnandez Stoll, was confirmed to a highly specialized court that primarily deals with patent law. By contrast, 10 such judges were confirmed during the same period in the George W. Bush presidency, a period when Democrats controlled the Senate. The second reason for Trump’s outsize impact on the judiciary is that when Democrats last controlled the Senate, one especially important Democrat — Judiciary Chair Patrick Leahy (VT) — took an unusually expansive view of the rights of the minority party. An informal tradition known as the “blue slip” sometimes gives home-state senators an exaggerated influence over who gets confirmed to federal judgeships within their states (the tradition gets its name from blue pieces of paper that home-state senators use to indicate whether they approve of a particular nominee). Traditionally, the Senate Judiciary Committee showed some level of deference to senators who disapprove of their home-state nominees, although the level of deference given to these senators varied wildly depending on who chaired the committee and whether that committee chair was politically aligned with the incumbent president. Leahy, who chaired the Committee for most of the Obama presidency, gave home-state senators a simply extraordinary power to block judicial nominees. Under Leahy, a single senator of either party could veto any nominee to a federal judgeship in their state (although federal appeals courts typically oversee multiple states, each individual seat on these courts is traditionally assigned to a particular state). Before Leahy, just one committee chair imposed such a rigid blue slip rule: Sen. James Eastland (D-MS), an arch-segregationist who took over the committee not long after the Supreme Court’s school integration decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). A strict blue slip rule allowed Southern senators to block judges who might try to desegregate public schools. Leahy, to be clear, is not a segregationist. He’s a reliably liberal Democrat. But he nonetheless reinstated the Eastland Rule during his tenure as chair of the Judiciary Committee. Leahy says that he did so to protect the “rights of the minority.” And protect Republicans he did. Red-state Republicans used the power Leahy gave them to hold many judicial seats open until Obama left office. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) effectively held a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit open for eight years until Trump could fill it. It’s tough to estimate the full impact of Leahy’s adherence to the Eastland Rule. The rule often stopped the Obama White House from nominating anyone to a vacant judgeship. According to Daniel Goldberg of the liberal Alliance for Justice, Obama “did not even make a nomination” to two seats on the Fifth Circuit because the blue slip would have doomed anyone he named; those seats were eventually filled by Trump nominees. In other cases, the blue slip allowed Republicans to drag out negotiations over a particular vacancy until McConnell took over the Senate in 2015 and imposed a blockade on nearly all of Obama’s appellate nominees. The Eastland Rule also weakened Obama’s hand in negotiations with Senate Republicans, and sometimes forced him to name relatively conservative judges in order to placate senators who could veto judicial nominees. Sens. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) and Johnny Isakson (R-GA), for example, effectively held one of Obama’s Eleventh Circuit nominees hostage until Obama agreed to also name Judge Julie Carnes — a George H.W. Bush district court appointee — to a second vacancy on that same court. Republicans did not reciprocate when they came to power. Not long after Trump took office, then-Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA) started confirming appellate court nominees over the objection of their home-state Democratic senators. (Republicans, for what it’s worth, have largely honored the blue slip tradition when a home-state senator objects to a district court nominee.) Leahy continued to defend the Eastland Rule well into the Trump administration. In a 2018 Senate floor speech, he touted the fact that he was “criticized by advocacy groups and even the editorial page of the New York Times” for allowing Republicans to veto Obama’s nominees, and he painted himself as a hero who “resisted such pressure.” Leahy also warned in the 2018 speech that Republicans were “failing to protect the fundamental rights of home-state senators.” By that point, Leahy’s adherence to the Eastland Rule had denied Obama the opportunity to fill many seats forever. In 2013, in a preview of how they would later treat the Garland nomination, Senate Republicans filibustered three Obama nominees to the powerful DC Circuit in an effort to keep Democrats from gaining a majority on that court. In response, Democrats fundamentally altered the filibuster to allow lower court judges to be confirmed by a simple majority. Under the old rules, the minority party could block a vote on any nominee, and it took 60 votes to end that filibuster. Now, only 51 votes are required to move forward to a confirmation vote. One consequence of filibuster reform is that it enabled Democrats to fill seats that Republicans held open with a filibuster. Democrats controlled the Senate for more than a year between the November 2013 reform vote and January 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate. So filibuster reform prevented Republicans from holding many judicial vacancies open until Trump could fill them. It also fundamentally altered who gets to be a federal judge. Democrats controlled the Senate for less than 14 months after filibuster reform. Yet nearly half of the former Supreme Court clerks Obama appointed to federal appellate judgeships were confirmed during this brief period — nearly as many as Obama appointed in the almost five years before filibuster reform. Similarly, nearly three-quarters of Obama’s post-reform appointees to the federal appellate bench clerked for a court of appeals judge — as compared to less than 38 percent of Obama’s pre-reform judges. One immediate impact of filibuster reform, in other words, is that it made it far easier for nominees with elite credentials to become federal judges. Here’s why: In the pre-reform Senate, a sterling résumé was often a liability for a judicial nominee because it flagged the nominee as a potential candidate for a future Supreme Court appointment. Both parties can tell stories of fallen martyrs, like George W. Bush nominee Miguel Estrada or Obama nominee Goodwin Liu, whose immaculate résumés painted a target on their backs. Both Estrada and Liu fell to filibusters. By filibustering plausible Supreme Court nominees before they got on the bench in the first place, the opposition party could diminish the governing party’s pool of potential justices and make it harder for the governing party to find an ideologically reliable Supreme Court nominee when the time came. But filibuster reform did not just improve the quality of nominees’ résumés. It also cleared the path for known ideologues to join the bench. And it appears to be altering how many sitting judges behave. As the 2016 election drew nigh, then-10th Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch looked like he was openly campaigning for a promotion. During this period, the Federalist Society grew increasingly obsessed with limiting the power of federal agencies to create binding regulations — an agenda that could hobble government bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency. Gorsuch signaled his loyalty to this anti-regulatory agenda by writing gratuitous opinions laying out new limits he hoped to impose on federal agencies. In one case, Gorsuch even attached a separate concurring opinion to his own majority opinion. As David Kaplan reports in The Most Dangerous Branch: Inside the Supreme Court’s Assault on the Constitution, one of these anti-regulatory opinions “proved decisive in clinching” the Trump White House’s decision to name Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch’s opinions, according to Kaplan, were “a way for Gorsuch to call attention to himself, and it worked.” When I speak to judges, I often hear them use a derisive term to describe this kind of behavior: “auditioning.” In a world without the filibuster, ambitious judges have less to fear from the opposition party. So they have every incentive to audition for the job that they want. After all, the best way to win the prize that Gorsuch captured for himself is to catch the eye of the Federalist Society and its adherents. While Trump has been very successful at filling the bench with brilliant Republican partisans, a Democratic president is unlikely to enjoy similar success. A badly malapportioned Senate means that to get even a bare majority in the Senate, Democrats have to win commanding popular vote majorities — and if Democrats don’t control the Senate, Democratic nominees could face the Merrick Garland treatment. Just look at the last two years of the Obama presidency if you want to know how a Republican Senate is likely to treat Democratic judicial nominees. Even if Democrats do overcome the odds to capture a majority, moreover, the balance of power is likely to be held by red-state Democrats who could be vulnerable to pressure from conservative interest groups hoping to keep Democratic nominees off the bench. In other words, it’ll be a long, long time before Democrats can undo the work Trump and the Republicans have done to turn the judiciary rightward. In the early months of the Trump presidency, so-called “Never Trump” Republicans often directed a derisive phrase against Trump supporters: “But Gorsuch.” It was a taunt that mocked the idea that it was worth selling your soul to a manifestly unfit TV celebrity who has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by more than a dozen women in order to keep control of the courts. But, as conservative columnist Hugh Hewitt wrote in 2018, “this bit of childish taunting always struck me as an unknowing admission of ignorance about the role assumed by the Supreme Court in modern American governance.” Certainly, McConnell understood this role. It’s why he was willing to use any means necessary to ensure Republican control of the judiciary. The truth is, by worshipping at the altar of Trump, Republicans haven’t simply ensured conservative dominance of one branch of government. They may have entrenched conservative governance for decades.

        "articles": "The Green Party presidential candidate said she’s cooperating with the committee’s requests. The Senate Intelligence Committee is scrutinizing another 2016 campaign for possible collusion with Russia: Green Party candidate Jill Stein. The details of the investigation are still murky, but Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC), who chairs the Intel committee that’s probing possible Trump-Russia collusion, told reporters on Monday that Stein’s campaign — which received about 1 percent of the vote in 2016 — is one of “two other campaigns we’re starting on” for possible collusion with the Kremlin. Bloomberg reports that the committee has asked for documents from the Stein campaign, and her communication director said in a statement that she’s cooperating with the request. “We strongly support legitimate inquiry into any illegal activity in our elections — including quid pro quo deals, money laundering, corruption and violation of campaign finance laws,” the statement read, adding that any investigation should not be a platform to “silence principled opposition to the political Establishment.” Complying with Senate Committee request, Jill Stein urges safeguarding elections from interference - while cautioning against the targeting of political opposition pic.twitter.com/YuHsBWJA0Z Of interest to the committee might be a 2015 dinner hosted by media outlet Russia Today that Stein attended in Moscow — where she was seated at a round table with Russian President Vladimir Putin and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the nature of his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. Stein has previously told the Intercept that she shook Putin’s hand, but didn’t interact with him much beyond that. “Nobody met anybody. I didn’t hear any words exchanged between English speakers and Russians,” she said. She also denied receiving any money for her trip; Flynn was reportedly paid $45,000 to speak at the event hosted by the state-owned media company. Stein reiterated this in her most recent statement about the Senate investigation, saying, “Our communications with Russian individuals regarding an invitation to speak on international relations at the RT 10th anniversary media conference will confirm what we stated publicly at that time and since: that we did not accept any payment or even reimbursement for the trip, and that we made the trip with the goal of reaching an international audience and Russian officials with a message of Middle East peace, diplomacy, and cooperation against the urgent threat of climate change.” We have a request In moments like this — as people grapple to understand variants and vaccines, and kids head back to school — many outlets take their paywalls down. ’s content is always free, in part because of financial support from our readers.

        "articles": "This isn't just about Harvey Weinstein or Donald Trump. “Harvey Weinstein is now a big problem for Democrats,” wrote CNN’s Chris Cillizza. “The Democrats cannot ignore their Harvey Weinstein problem,” wrote the Week’s Ed Morrissey. “Yes, Hillary — and the Democrats — Do Have a Harvey Weinstein Problem,” wrote the Daily Beast’s Keli Goff. Headlines like these were inescapable in the days after the Weinstein scandal broke. They are not wrong so much as they are incomplete. More than a dozen women have accused Donald Trump of sexual assault, telling stories that often mirror the stories told about Weinstein. Trump, of course, received advice and debate prep from the late Roger Ailes after Ailes left Fox News over a series of sexual harassment allegations. Speaking of Fox News, over the weekend, the New York Times reported that Bill O’Reilly was still at the channel, after he settled a sexual harassment accusation for $32 million — in total, he’s now known to have settled about $45 million in sexual harassment accusations. Fox News signed him to a lucrative contract after that payout happened. So perhaps it’s really Republicans who have a Donald Trump problem, or a Fox News problem — after all, Fox News and Donald Trump have had more influence over the GOP than Weinstein ever had over the Democrats. But let’s stop hiding behind these sorts of headlines. It’s America that has the problem. Pick an industry and you’ll hear stories. Journalism is being rocked by an anonymous list of men who are said to abuse and harass women; BuzzFeed is investigating a number of its senior employees; and ’s parent company,  Media, fired its editorial director after an investigation revealed misconduct. In Hollywood, there are now 38 women accusing director James Toback of sexual harassment. Rumors of sexual assault have spilled into the open about comedian Louis CK, actor Ben Affleck, and others. Last week, the hashtag #MeToo took over social media. Virtually every woman I follow, on every social platform, no matter the industry or walk of life they came from, shared stories of harassment, abuse, and worse. I read searing tales from reporters and techies, chefs and yogis, civil servants and mountain climbers. There is a pervasiveness to sexual assault in America that defies the word “problem.” When a system creates an outcome this consistently, this predictably, in this many different spaces, you have to at least consider the possibility that the outcome is intended, that the system is working as designed. Perhaps we need to do more than try to root out the worst abusers. Perhaps we need to rethink our sexual culture too. In theory, existing laws, and existing HR departments, should be capable of handling the worst sexual predators. But our worst sexual predators reflect a sexual culture that is already tilted far against women, where even in the absence of professional power dynamics, the burden of establishing consent is on the person resisting, not the one aggressing. There are efforts to change this culture through both law and regulation. One of the more controversial articles I’ve written is a defense of affirmative consent laws. These laws try to impose a “yes means yes” standard on sexual relations. Did she consent to being kissed? To being touched? To being penetrated? Was she capable of consent — sober enough, conscious enough? If not, then it can be claimed as assault. This is, for many, an absurdity to contemplate. Sex is too powerful, too primal, too uncertain to be chained to legalistic consent rules. What if she’s your wife? What if he’s your longtime boyfriend? What if you’re both so turned on that you can barely think, can barely talk, but everyone’s every movement is a yes unto itself? But take a complex area of human relations that we really do take seriously: property rights. Here, too, we have a yes-means-yes standard, though we rarely call it that. The only way I can legally take something that belongs to you is if you explicitly give me permission. That’s true even if I’m just borrowing it, or even if I’m just testing to see if you’re willing to let me have it, or even if I really want it, or even if you’re too drunk to realize I took it. In practice, of course, goods are exchanged all the time without official consent. I borrow pens from my colleagues without asking, and I act with impunity around my best friend’s fridge. I have borrowed bikes, cars, books, headphones, and even money without asking. But I only do that when I am certain the consent would be there, and if I am wrong, well, the consequences could be severe, and I will be the one to bear them. The argument for yes-means-yes laws in sexual relations is an argument about who should bear the burden of making sure there’s consent — who should have to ask, who should have to make themselves clearly heard, who should shoulder the discomfort of an awkward question. It is based on a belief that the gray area we have now is the wrong gray area, that it asks too much of women and permits too much from men, that we gain less from this spontaneity than we lose from the prevalence of assault. Our current sexual culture rewards men for aggression, for testing boundaries, for making an unexpected and maybe even unwanted move. Assault flourishes in this environment. “I just didn’t realize how to go about something, what even asking consent was,” this man told the woman he assaulted in a powerful interview. “I thought someone just went along with it, and it just happened.” It is not hard to see how the men who prosper in that culture might ultimately become predators within it, particularly when they become powerful, famous, and protected. “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump said. But that’s changing, or at least it seems to be. As women come forward more and more often, as lists of toxic men circulate via anonymous email networks (as is currently happening in journalism), as HR departments begin to enforce the rules they say they have, aggressors will begin to face consequences. That will mean men lose the jobs they have or are quietly blackballed from jobs they want; it will mean they develop a reputation they never wanted or face legal consequences. This status quo — with its particular ambiguities and gray areas — isn’t going to work for men either. Perhaps yes-means-yes is the wrong solution. There may be better standards, smarter approaches, more humane reforms. But something must be done, and it needs to be bigger than a few scapegoats.

        "articles": "In April, amid growing speculation that she would run for president, Sen. Elizabeth Warren gave a pivotal speech titled \"The Unfinished Business of Financial Reform.\" In it, Warren laid out what the next Democratic president could and must do to complete the task of post-crisis financial reform. Specifically, Warren said the next president’s agenda should: Warren didn’t wind up running for president. But her five points are a good rubric for evaluating Hillary Clinton’s newly released plan to tame Wall Street. Clinton’s agenda is a very detailed and comprehensive dive into financial reform. It is broad, covering parts of the financial markets that aren’t often discussed. If anything, it goes into such footnoted specifics that it can be overly wonky. But it fits into the Warren framework well enough to compare and contrast the two approaches. Using the Warren criteria, Clinton gets points on the first four, but approaches the fifth by working through Dodd-Frank rather than against it. Bernie Sanders gets major points on the last two, but hasn’t gotten specific on tackling shadow banking and the broader financial sector. Rather than stronger or weaker, we’re left with two different ways of prioritizing financial reform, with Sanders focusing on eliminating the threat of the largest banks and Clinton looking to the financial markets as a whole. Dodd, Frank. Republicans are united in wanting to weaken or eliminate Dodd-Frank. Major 2016 contenders such as Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Carly Fiorina have called for the outright elimination of the law without specifying any alternative. So rallying against this is the first test. This is a pretty easy test for a Democratic candidate, which Clinton, like Sanders, passes. Clinton has sent three important signals to financial reformers. First, she wrote a letter pushing back on recent attempts to change the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an important short-term priority. Second, her fact sheet emphasizes Dodd-Frank’s Section 956, which is the requirement to limit incentive pay for executives at large financial firms. Section 956 is crucial to changing the nature of CEO pay at major banks so that it rewards long-term thinking and can be revoked if a firm fails. To the chagrin of reformers, it has stalled in rule writing. Clinton would prioritize finalizing it. Third, and most important, in the fact sheet Clinton warns against efforts to roll back Dodd-Frank’s financial reforms in \"the upcoming budget and debt ceiling negotiations\" while vowing to \"veto any legislation that attempts to weaken the law and would fully enforce its protections.\" One of reformers’ biggest worries at the moment is that this December’s budget chaos could allow Republicans to push through major deregulations, and that the president and Democrats would allow it. Clinton is making a direct challenge to President Obama, who may be called on to veto a budget if lobbyists are successful in their sneak attacks on reform. Some bankers — like ex-Goldman Sachs bond seller Fabrice Tourre — faced civil charges after the financial crisis, but they were the exception. Spencer Platt/Getty Images Clinton wants to enforce financial regulations by leveling charges against individuals as well as corporations. Following the criticism of regulators leveled by Warren and others, the Clinton plan would have the Department of Justice curtail the deferral of prosecutions, a tactic used often to the benefit of banks and other firms facing criminal charges. Clinton would have the SEC forgo these agreements in cases of \"egregious or repeated law-breaking and misconduct\" and require that firms admit wrongdoing. Another important change would be the SEC curtailing large penalties and restriction on activities for repeat offenders, a process all too common now. This \"broken window\" style of policing is unpopular for community policing, but is being emphasized in financial policing. Restrictions on repeat offenders in particular are a core demand of Warren’s. Clinton’s plan would also make funding for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and SEC independent so that, like other regulators, they would not be subject to the booms and busts of congressional dysfunction. This would give them the ability to better enforce the rules of the financial sector. Warren’s agenda goes a bit further than this and takes the fight to the Federal Reserve, arguing that the Fed should require votes on all major enforcement and supervisory decisions and that Fed governors should have independent staff. This is a response to the lax supervision and enforcement the central bank displayed during the foreclosure crisis. Clinton focuses on the other banking regulators and the Department of Justice, but doesn’t touch on the Federal Reserve in her plan. Though Bernie Sanders has been vocal about abuses in enforcement, so far he hasn’t laid out specifics. Gary Gensler, a key influence on Hillary Clinton's plan. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Many reformers, including the Roosevelt Institute with its \"Rewriting the Rules\" report, have demanded a comprehensive policy agenda on shadow banking, the network of lending and borrowing that takes place outside the formal banking sector. Warren’s speech calls for it to be a priority, leaving the details to be determined later. That’s a reasonable way to start the conversation, since it is a difficult topic, but eventually people need to start putting the specifics on the table. The Clinton fact sheet does exactly that, with a detailed description on everything from stronger capital requirements for broker-dealers to requiring more disclosures for private equity. This section clearly reflects the influence of Gary Gensler, the former CFTC commissioner (and Goldman Sachs banker) who fought with Obama’s Treasury secretary, Tim Geithner, over making financial reform stronger. The section discusses the international coordination of derivatives, a topic that dominated the end of Gensler’s tenure at the CFTC. According to reports, his efforts to fight for the toughest regulations on this end also led to major conflicts with Obama’s next Treasury secretary, Jack Lew. Consistent with his approach of focusing on the biggest banks, so far Bernie Sanders hasn’t released a plan to deal with shadow banking. The NYSE trading floor. Andrew Burton/Getty Images Hillary Clinton proposes a tax to combat high-frequency trading (HFT) by targeting orders that get canceled. This is a worthwhile thing to combat, but Clinton’s proposal would not raise much money, since it only applies to HFT and would shrink the entire market substantially by design. It’s also not clear if it will make a dent on HFT unless it is broader or paired with efforts to regulate how often trades are made by, say, requiring them to batch up every 100 milliseconds. A transaction tax on the financial sector as a whole could raise as much as $50 billion a year according to the Tax Policy Center. The Sanders campaign proposes such a financial transaction tax as a way of combating HFT as well as a way to pay for free college. So this targeted versus expansive approach is a clear difference, with Sanders taking a more aggressive approach. Paul Volcker, whose namesake rule is at the crux of Hillary Clinton's plan to limit big banks. Monica Schipper/Getty Images Clinton, unlike Warren or Sanders, doesn’t call for breaking up the banks by size and by business line through a new Glass-Steagall Act. Clinton also doesn’t limit the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending further than it has been limited since Dodd-Frank, as Warren wants to do. But she does have a different approach. Clinton would instead build on the reforms in Dodd-Frank. Instead of direct limitations, her plan includes tax surcharges on the largest banks, which are designed to slim them down. President Obama proposed such a tax in 2010, but it was designed to raise revenues. This would instead supplement capital requirements, which have become the most practical way of pressuring the largest banks to downsize, as GE Capital recently did. It is not clear how aggressive this tax would be in practice, but it is a different way of combating size. Dodd-Frank’s Volcker Rule — which separates hedge funds from commercial banking — has been described as the Obama administration’s replacement of Glass-Steagall. And, as Matt Yglesias described yesterday, Clinton’s plan would bolster the rule by removing loopholes, including the one introduced during last year’s budget fight. Strengthening the Volcker Rule is a different approach to separating financial business lines, one that sees hedge funds as more of a threat than the mingling of commercial and investment banking. Sanders’s plans are more traditional. He has breaking up the banks as the first two main items on his Wall Street agenda webpage. He is a supporter of Glass-Steagall, and was also an early supporter of the SAFE Banking Act, which would have broken up banks to be around $500 billion in size. His newest bill, the \"Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act,\" would ask regulators to break up banks they deem too risky, explicitly including the biggest globally significant banks in the US, like Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. High! We should aim up high! Stepping back, there are two clear stories about what's wrong in the financial sector. Bernie Sanders’s agenda is based on the idea that Dodd-Frank did little to combat the threat of the largest financial institutions, and we need to focus directly on them as both a political and an economic threat. Clinton’s approach looks to the financial markets as a whole. Their focus on the largest banks is driven by turning up the regulations introduced in Dodd-Frank, rather than going completely outside the framework. The core of what they introduce that is new is meant to frame the problem of finance as broader than any group of large institutions. There are pros and cons to each approach. There’s a real sense that slightly higher capital requirements could force the largest banks to reduce their size, a process politically easier than breaking up the banks directly. Depending on specifics, the Clinton tax could do this. There’s little reason to do only half a financial transaction tax as Clinton does, especially if it isn’t clear the moderate approach would be enough to put a dent in HFT. The continued focus on Glass-Steagall hangs oddly over the debate, since the primary housing and financial crisis occurred outside the traditional commercial banking sector, and future worries are as likely to be in opaque corners of the financial markets.

        "articles": "Senate Republicans are holding a hearing on the issue. But the evidence suggests it’s not a real problem. Senate Republicans have found a new enemy in America’s opioid epidemic: Medicaid. On Wednesday, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, led by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), will hold a hearing focused on the impact of Medicaid on the opioid epidemic. Along with the hearing, Johnson also released a report and an op-ed that attempt to blame Medicaid — and the Medicaid expansion funded by the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) — for at least part of the growth in drug overdose deaths over the past several years. The basic argument: Medicaid, particularly through the Obamacare-funded expansion, gave patients greater access to opioid painkillers — by linking them to doctors who could prescribe the drugs and by paying for many of the pills. Patients then misused the opioids, shared the drugs with others, or sold them on the black market. That, the claim goes, fueled the current drug overdose crisis, which led to nearly 64,000 overdose deaths in 2016. This is not a new argument. During the debate over Obamacare repeal, some Republicans raised this claim as part of their rationale for pulling back the health care law’s insurance expansion. Online, this argument has gained more traction due to wider discussion in the blogosphere and social media. But this claim runs into a basic problem: the concept of time. Medicaid didn’t expand under Obamacare until 2014 — well after opioid overdose deaths started rising (in the late 1990s), after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011 declared the crisis an epidemic, and as the crisis became more about illicit opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl, rather than conventional opioid painkillers. “It’s pretty ridiculous,” Andrew Kolodny, an opioid policy expert at Brandeis University who’s scheduled to testify at the Senate hearing, told me. Yet the claim has persisted, wrapped in the broader context of Republicans trying to cut Medicaid. During 2017’s Obamacare repeal efforts, Republicans proposed cutting the program and undoing the Medicaid expansion. Recently, President Donald Trump’s administration and Republican state leaders have moved to tie work requirements to Medicaid. And congressional Republicans have publicly discussed passing entitlement reforms — which would cut Medicaid, among other federal programs — at some point in 2018. This has long been a goal of Republicans, who claim Medicaid is too expensive and removes an incentive to work (by letting people get insurance without a job). Other evidence, meanwhile, suggests that Medicaid could actually act as a solution to the opioid crisis — because Medicaid, by expanding access to addiction treatment, could help stem the tide of addiction and overdose deaths. So by using this new hearing and report to potentially attack Medicaid, Republicans may be in fact undermining a potential solution to the overdose crisis. The origins of the theorized link between Medicaid and the opioid epidemic appear to be a passage from Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic, a 2015 book by Sam Quinones: “For a three-dollar Medicaid co-pay, therefore, addicts got pills priced at thousands of dollars, with the difference paid for by U.S. and state taxpayers. A user could turn around and sell those pills, obtained for that three-dollar co-pay, for as much as ten thousand dollars on the street.” Conservative pundits and policymakers, including Senate Republicans’ report, have latched onto this kind of anecdote. They also claim there’s a correlation between states that expanded Medicaid and higher drug overdose death rates, and point out that people who receive Medicaid appear to fill out more opioid prescriptions than people who are privately insured. “In 2015, the seven states with the highest drug-overdose death rates were West Virginia, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts,” Sam Adolphsen, who is scheduled to testify at the Senate hearing, wrote in National Review. “These states all have something else in common: All were among the 31 states (not including D.C.) that expanded Medicaid through Obamacare.” Researchers, however, have put this supposed link through a more rigorous scientific analysis than the pundits and policymakers have — and they’ve concluded that there’s no good evidence to suggest that the Medicaid expansion led to higher drug overdose death rates. The best review of the evidence is a 2017 Health Affairs report by Andrew Goodman-Bacon and Emma Sandoe. They concluded: First, trends in opioid deaths nationally and by Medicaid expansion status predate the [Affordable Care Act]. Second, counties with the largest coverage gains actually experienced smaller increases in drug-related mortality than counties with smaller coverage gains. Third, the fact that Medicaid recipients fill more opioid prescriptions than non-recipients largely reflects greater levels of disability and chronic illness in the populations that Medicaid serves. Take a look at the following chart by Goodman-Bacon and Sandoe. It shows that the states that would go on to expand Medicaid saw a divergence in drug overdose deaths compared to non-expansion states before the Obamacare expansion began in 2014. If the expansion caused the divergence, this chronology would simply not be possible. This chart, instead, supports the opposite conclusion that Republicans are drawing from the correlation. As Kolodny told me, “The only explanation I can come up with if there really is this association is that states hit hardest by the opioid crisis were more likely to expand Medicaid perhaps because they were dealing with a very expensive [opioid] problem.” There’s another basic time problem with the Republican theory: The nature of the opioid crisis has, if anything, shifted away from opioid painkillers since the Medicaid expansion began. Starting around 2011, opioid painkiller overdose deaths began to level off. That same year, heroin overdose death began to rise. Then in 2014, overdose deaths linked to synthetic opioids like illicit fentanyl began to rapidly increase as well — and now these synthetic opioids are the biggest cause of overdose death in the US. Research tells a similar story: A 2017 study in Addictive Behaviors found that 51.9 percent of people entering treatment for opioid use disorder in 2015 started with prescription drugs, down from 84.7 percent in 2005. And 33.3 percent initiated with heroin in 2015, up from 8.7 percent in 2005. This simply doesn’t gel with the theory that the Medicaid expansion fueled the opioid crisis. If the theory held up, we would expect to see a dramatic rise in opioid painkiller addiction and overdose deaths since 2014, because those were the drugs that new Medicaid patients would now have access to. Instead, the painkiller problem seems to have by and large leveled off while other opioids have become much bigger concerns. (That’s not to say opioid painkiller addiction is no longer a problem, but it’s not the rapidly growing calamity it once was.) The Senate Republican report also goes beyond pointing to the above correlations, touting evidence of people defrauding Medicaid to obtain opioid painkillers: “At least 1,072 people have been convicted or charged nationwide since 2010 for improperly using Medicaid to obtain prescription opioids, some of which were then resold on the nation’s streets. The number of criminal defendants increased 18 percent in the four years after Medicaid expanded, 2014-2017, compared to the four years prior to Medicaid expansion.” This correlation, though, doesn’t necessarily give evidence for more crimes; it could also be evidence that law enforcement is now taking these types of crimes more seriously. For example, Obamacare allocated $350 million for health care fraud prevention and enforcement. As the opioid epidemic has received more attention, it’s not surprising that law enforcement would use these and other resources to go after crimes linked to the crisis. Now, it is true that Medicaid has generally paid for more opioid prescriptions since the 1990s. And some of those opioids were diverted to misuse and trafficking, as Quinones reported. But this was true for all health insurers. In the 1990s, private insurers also got swept up in paying for more painkillers as doctors prescribed way more of the drugs (in large part due to a misleading marketing push from major drug companies suggesting, incorrectly, that opioids were safe and effective). Private insurers, like Medicaid, also often paid for these painkillers with little to no cost to the patient. And the patients, like those on Medicaid, sometimes shared or sold their extra pills. It’s through this embrace of opioids by the whole health care system — from insurers to doctors to drug companies — that the US became by far the world’s biggest consumer of opioids, causing the pills to proliferate to people with pain, teens rummaging through parents’ medicine cabinets, and the black market. (More on the causes in ’s opioid epidemic explainer.) Some previous data does suggest that Medicaid recipients receive opioid prescriptions twice as often as non-recipients. But to the extent this is still true, Goodman-Bacon and Sandoe’s analysis concluded that it’s likely due to differences in health care needs: “Medicaid patients, especially those who qualify through a disability and many who do not, are more likely to have chronic conditions and comorbidities that require pain relief. Between 2010 and 2016, 30 percent of Medicaid recipients ages 25-54 reported having pain most days or every day, compared to 14 percent of non-recipients.” (Remember: One cause for Medicaid eligibility is a severe disability.) So blaming Medicaid for this problem unfairly singles out one program for what was really a broader systemic issue in the health care system. The reality, according to drug policy and public health experts, is that Medicaid could actually play a role in ending the opioid crisis. That’s because Medicaid can help pay for addiction treatment, including highly effective medications, such as buprenorphine and methadone, that are considered the gold standard treatment for opioid addiction. This is already true to some extent: According to a 2014 study by Truven Health Analytics researchers, Medicaid paid for about 25 percent — $7.9 billion of $31.3 billion — of projected public and private spending for drug addiction treatment in 2014. That made it the second-biggest payer for drug addiction treatment spending after all local and state government programs. Some places have also leveraged Medicaid dollars in innovative ways. Vermont, for example, has built a “hub and spoke” system that treats addiction as a public health issue and integrates treatment into the rest of health care. Obamacare and Medicaid were crucial to this: The state obtained a special Medicaid waiver through the federal health care law to help fund the program, and it continues paying for treatment services largely through insurance payments from patients who are often insured thanks to Obamacare’s insurance expansion. Now, Medicaid and expanding access to insurance won’t solve every problem. Even when people have insurance, they can face other hurdles to treatment, such as high out-of-pocket costs, long waiting periods, or even a total dearth of treatment facilities in their area. That’s why experts like Kolodny argue that the US needs to spend tens of billions of dollars to rapidly scale up treatment across the country; otherwise, people may have insurance, but they won’t have access to treatment that they can actually use that insurance for. But even if it’s not a perfect fix, Medicaid could at least help give some people greater access to addiction treatment. Given the evidence, Kolodny argued that the new hearing and report are really about a broader Republican agenda to cut Medicaid. After all, this is something that Republicans have been trying to do for years; as House Speaker Paul Ryan once said, he’s been “dreaming” of cutting Medicaid since he and his buddies were “drinking out of kegs.” “People are using the opioid addiction epidemic to further their own political agenda,” Kolodny said. “That bothers me.

        "articles": "Last Thursday, the nation watched with a mix of amusement and horror as the House Benghazi committee spent 11 hours grilling Hillary Clinton on a bizarre farrago of issues, many of which bore only tangential connection to the Benghazi attack. Over the past few weeks, the political narrative seems to have shifted from \"Clinton in trouble\" to \"congressional witch hunt seeks to take down Clinton.\" Between McCarthy's accidental truth telling, an ex-staffer confirming the worst reports about the committee, and another House Republican conceding the obvious, it has become clear that the Benghazi committee is a thoroughly partisan political endeavor. Opinion has turned, but Republicans are trapped. The thing is: The Benghazi committee is not even the worst committee in the House. I'd argue that the House science committee, under the chairmanship of Lamar Smith (R-TX), deserves that superlative for its open-ended, Orwellian attempts to intimidate some of the nation's leading scientists and scientific institutions. The science committee's modus operandi is similar to the Benghazi committee's — sweeping, catchall investigations, with no specific allegations of wrongdoing or clear rationale, searching through private documents for out-of-context bits and pieces to leak to the press, hoping to gain short-term political advantage — but it stands to do more lasting long-term damage. In both cases, the investigations have continued long after all questions have been answered. (There were half a dozen probes into Benghazi before this one.) In both cases, the chair has drifted from inquiry to inquisition. But with Benghazi, the only threat is to the reputation of Hillary Clinton, who has the resources to defend herself. With the science committee, it is working scientists being intimidated, who often do not have the resources to defend themselves, and the threat is to the integrity of the scientific process in the US. It won't take much for scientists to get the message that research into politically contested topics is more hassle than it's worth. This year, Smith was one of the committee chairs granted sweeping new subpoena powers by his fellow House Republicans, what one staffer called \"exporting the Issa model.\" No longer is the chair required to consult with the ranking member before launching investigations or issuing subpoenas. A spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said, \"This change will inevitably [lead] to widespread abuses of power as Republicans infect the other committees with the poisonous process that Issa has so abused during his chairmanship.\" That turned out to be pretty prescient, at least in the case of the science committee. No chair has taken to his new role with as much enthusiasm as Smith. Here are just three of his recent exploits. In June, a scientist named Thomas Karl, along with colleagues, published a peer-reviewed paper in the journal Science called \"Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus.\" It cast doubt on the global warming \"pause\" that has become the latest cause célèbre for climate change, er, doubters. That did not sit well with Smith, who is a doubter himself, like many of the Republicans on his committee and more than half of all House Republicans. And it was the subject of much heated attack in the denial-o-sphere. So Smith has gone after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where Karl works as the director of the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). For a play-by-play, I recommend this scorching letter to Smith from committee ranking member Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX). In it, she notes that Smith made three written requests for information about Karl's study, all of which NOAA responded to in writing and in personal briefings. \"Moreover,\" she writes, \"NOAA attempted to explain certain aspects of the methodology about which the Majority was apparently confused.\" (Imagine how that meeting went.) Among Smith's repeated demands: access to the data and methods behind NOAA's work on climate. Except, as NOAA and Democratic members of the committee kept trying to explain, those data and methods are posted on the internet. Anyone can access them. Yet Republicans kept demanding them. Unsatisfied with the total cooperation and untrammeled access his committee received, Smith issued a subpoena: On October 13, the committee subpoenaed nearly seven years of internal deliberations and communications among scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including \"all documents and communications\" related to NOAA’s measurement of our climate. \"All documents and communications\" would presumably include emails, preliminary drafts, peer review comments, notes, audio recordings, and a treasure trove of other material. This would mean thousands upon thousands of records for employees to identify and go through and analyze for no clearly stated purpose. NOAA was given two weeks to comply. (Coincidentally, the very following day, longtime climate skeptic blogger Bob Tisdale published a long post calling into question the very adjustments to temperature data that were mentioned in Smith's subpoena.) To be clear, Smith has not alleged any corruption, wrongdoing, or even bad science. He hasn't alleged anything. Nor has he offered any justification for why he needs access to NOAA internal communications. The new rules mean that he no longer has to explain or justify himself to anyone. He's just hoping to find something he can use. Here's the most pointed part of Johnson's letter: The baseless conflict you have created by issuing the October 13 subpoena is representative of a disturbing pattern in your use of Congressional power since your Chairmanship began. In the past two years and ten months that you have presided as Chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology you have issued more subpoenas (six) than were issued in the prior 54 year history of the Committee. That prior Committee history is filled with extensive legitimate oversight concerning consequential events — oftentimes quite literally matters of life and death. Yet none of the prior eleven Chairs of our Committee exercised their authority with the degree of partisan brashness as is now the case in our Committee. Recently, political pressure on Exxon and the oil industry has been growing. In May, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) gave a speech and penned an op-ed on the possibility of a RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) case against the energy industry, arguing that the \"parallels between what the tobacco industry did and what the fossil fuel industry is doing now are striking.\" On September 1, a group of about 20 climate scientists sent a letter to President Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and OSTP Director John Holdren recommending that they look into a RICO case. Holdren replied, deferring any legal decisions to the Department of Justice but writing that \"the Administration shares the concern expressed in the letter about the seriousness of the threat posed by climate change.\" On September 21, InsideClimate News published the first in what would become a blockbuster series of stories that made clear just how much Exxon knew about the dangers of climate change, and how soon, well before it spent millions of dollars deliberately obscuring the issue. In early October, the LA Times followed up with its own investigation. On October 15, Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA) wrote Lynch asking the Department of Justice to investigate whether the company violated the law. On October 20, Bernie Sanders joined the call for a federal investigation. None of this sat well with Smith, either. So he's going after one of the scientists who signed the letter to Obama. Apparently the letter was (inadvertently, the organization says) posted on the website of George Mason University's Institute of Global Environment and Society (IGES), a nonprofit research institution led by one of the scientists who signed the letter, Jagadish Shukla. Science journalist Warren Cornwall tells what happened next: The letter eventually came to the attention of outsiders, including science policy specialist Roger Pielke, Jr., of the University of Colorado, Boulder. Pielke, an active voice in debates over climate science and policy, called attention to the letter on Twitter, and also raised questions about IGES’s finances. Soon, journalists, including several associated with conservative news outlets, were writing about the letter and IGES. The Daily Caller, for example, noted that \"climate scientists asking Obama to prosecute skeptics got millions from U.S. taxpayers,\" in a 21 September story. Smith got wind of this and sent Shukla a letter (citing the Daily Caller story) noting that \"IGES appears to be almost fully funded by taxpayer money while simultaneously participating in partisan political activity by requesting a RICO investigation of companies and organizations that disagree with the Obama administration on climate change.\" Here's what Smith demanded from IGES: 1. Preserve all e-mail, electronic documents, and data (\"electronic records\") created since January 1, 2009, that can be reasonably anticipated to be subject to a request for production by the Committee. ... 2. Exercise reasonable efforts to identify and notify current employees, former employees, contractors, and third party groups who may have access to such electronic records that they are to be preserved ... Like the other scientists, Shukla signed the letter as a private citizen, not a representative of his organization. Yet \"current employees, former employees, contractors, and third party groups\" will now be hounded for electronic records back to 2009. Now the whole mess has come to the attention of bottom feeder Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who spends his time hassling scientists with public records requests. He has now filed them with several universities that employ scientists who signed the letter. For more than 60 years, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has supported basic research in science and engineering. With a $7 billion budget, it is responsible for about 20 percent of the federal government's basic research spending. The NSF \"merit review\" process is something of a legend, a multilayered process that sends each grant past a panel of independent scientists, researchers, and educators in the field, with scrupulous rules to avoid conflicts of interest. About 80 percent of applications fail to pass review; receiving an NSF grant is widely seen as a mark of prestige in the science world. Crucially, the peer review is blind. The names of reviewers are never disclosed. Republicans on the science committee believe they have discovered an important flaw in the process: Sometimes it awards grants to studies that sound funny. Smith is convinced that NSF is wasting public money by funding these funny-sounding studies, which has led to a long and acrimonious fight between Republicans on the committee and committee Democrats, NSF's leadership, and much of the academic and research community. (Said parties have engaged in a long and spirited exchange of correspondence, which you can read in full here.) Smith is demanding that NSF turn over all the details — including internal communications and the names of reviewers — related to a growing list of grants that he thinks don't sound quite right. It's up to about 50 now, and as journalist Jeffrey Mervis explains, \"the scientific community is scratching its head over how Smith compiled his list of questionable grants\": [T]he list is hard to characterize. One grant goes back to 2005, and 13 appear to have expired. The total amount of money awarded is about $26 million. The smallest grant, awarded in 2005, is $19,684 for a doctoral dissertation on \"culture, change & chronic stress in lowland Bolivia.\" The largest, for $5.65 million, is for a project that aims to use innovative education methods to educate Arctic communities about climate change and related issues. If you do the math, $26 million represents about 0.37 percent of NSF's budget. Smith demanded that all files related to these grants be sent to his House offices. NSF leadership pushed back, which led to this absurd scene: Four times this past summer, in a spare room on the top floor of the headquarters of the National Science Foundation (NSF) outside of Washington, D.C., two congressional staffers spent hours poring over material relating to 20 research projects that NSF has funded over the past decade. Each folder contained confidential information that included the initial application, reviewer comments on its merit, correspondence between program officers and principal investigators, and any other information that had helped NSF decide to fund the project. No one knows what Smith and his staffers are looking for, because they won't say. It's difficult to imagine what staffers think they will learn from rifling through these documents, or why they think the judgments they come to in a few hours will improve upon NSF's peer review process. All they can hope to find is fodder for more press releases. What's clear is that Smith's unilateral use of subpoena power has forced the NSF to compromise the longstanding confidentiality of its review process. It has sent letters to several universities that employ grantees, explaining that it had no choice but to turn over documents. But the damage is already being done. The trust the foundation has built among the scientific community over the past 60 years is in jeopardy. In another damning letter to her counterpart, Rep. Johnson says: The plain truth is that there are no credible allegations of waste, fraud, or abuse associated with these 20 awards. The only issue with them appears to be that you, personally, think that the grants sound wasteful based on your understanding of their titles and purpose. Seeking to substitute your judgment for the determinations of NSF's merit review process is the antithesis of the successful principles our nation has relied on to make our research investment decisions. The path you are going down risks becoming a textbook example of political judgment trumping expert judgment. She goes on to note that on September 16, Fox News carried a story about one of the grants that contained a quote from Smith disparaging it, along with two pieces of information that could only have been gleaned from the confidential materials involved in the grant. To summarize: The chair of a House committee is using his newly expanded subpoena power to go fishing through the work of the NSF, forcing it to breach its storied confidentiality, searching for bits and pieces of decontextualized information that can be leaked to right-wing media to make the executive branch look bad, on behalf of an ideological quest to cut research funding. The science committee, Fox News, the Daily Caller, climate deniers, CEI — at this point, it's all one partisan operation, sharing information and strategies. Republican radicalization has already laid waste to many of the written and unwritten rules that once governed American politics. The use of congressional committees as tools of partisan intimidation is only a chapter in that grim story. But the science committee is going after individual scientists, who rarely have the resources on hand to defend themselves from unexpected political attack. It is doing so without any rationale related to the constitutional exercise of its oversight powers — not with a false rationale, but without any stated rationale, no allegations of waste, fraud, or abuse — in service of an effort to suppress inconvenient scientific results and score partisan political points against the executive branch. The federal government is an enormous supporter of scientific research, to the country's great and enduring benefit, though that support is now under sustained attack. If such funding comes with strings, with the threat that the wrong inquiry or results could bring down a congressional inquisition, researchers are likely to shy away from controversial subjects. The effects on the US scientific community, and on America's reputation as a leader in science, could be dire, lingering on well past the 2016 election.

        "articles": " what the average American sees is that for many decades now, what corporate America has said is, \"Hey, I'm not going to pay you 20 or 25 bucks at a factory, I don't need you anymore. We're going to shut your factory down. I'm going to move to China, pay people there a buck or two an hour. I don't have to worry about environmental regulations, I don't have to worry about trade unions, and I'm going to produce products there and I'm going to bring them back to the United States of America.\" Now, is that the fault of China? No. That issue has to do with the greed of corporate America who sold out American workers and essentially moved manufacturing to China and other low-wage countries. Are Americans concerned about that ... when they walk in a department store and product after product after product that is not made in the United States but is made in China, are they concerned about it? Yeah, they are. So am I, as a matter of fact. Does that mean that we have to make China into an enemy? Absolutely not. What we need is a trade policy in this country, among other things, that works for the American worker rather than the CEOs of large corporations. I voted against [permanent normal trade relations] with China, that was the right vote, and if elected president I will radically transform trade policies. If I were Chinese, though, that would sound very zero sum to me, because those factories have been part of the tremendous rise in living standards there. That's great, but you know what? At the same time, the living standards of the American people have gone down. As I indicated to you earlier, I am an internationalist. I want to see poor people around the world see their standard of living increase, but you talk about zero sum. A lot of people tell me the American worker's going to have to become poorer so we can help poor people in China. I don't believe that for a second. I want to see the people in China live in a democratic society with a higher standard of living. I want to see that, but I don't think that has to take place at the expense of the American worker. I don't think decent-paying jobs in this country have got to be lost as companies shut down here and move to China. I want to see the Chinese people do as well, but I do not want to see the collapse of the American middle class take place, and I will fight against that as hard as I can. To go to another continent, do you think the euro was a mistake? That's a very good question. I can't give you a definitive answer right now. I will tell you this of what's happening in Greece. I am very concerned that the Germans have led an effort to squeeze blood from the stone. The Greek economy has contracted by about 25 percent over the last 5 years, unemployment is 26 percent, youth unemployment somewhere around 60 percent, and the idea that Germany and European banks are pushing more austerity on the Greek people I think is not only a terrible economic mistake, it's a political mistake, and I'll tell you why. The third-largest party in Greece is the party called \"Golden Dawn,\" you know who they are? They're a Nazi party. Not even neos. These are real Nazis. If you remember what happened in 1932 in Germany when you had hyperinflation, when you had an economy that was in a terrible depression — that's the kind of climate that a Hitler could come to power in. I think that the European community has got to work with Greece to create economic growth, deal with unemployment, create an economy so that they can, over a period of years, pay back their debt, but you cannot keep squeezing that country, so I have concerns about that. Let me end on a question about a policy that is getting, seems to be, some momentum but it's not often talked about in Washington, which is a universal basic income. You've begun to have people go back to both Milton Friedman and Martin Luther King Jr., saying we should really have a fundamentally guaranteed standard of living in this country. I am absolutely sympathetic to that approach. That's why I'm fighting for a $15 minimum wage, why I'm fighting to make sure that everybody in this country gets the nutrition they need, why I'm fighting to expand Social Security benefits and not cut them, making sure that every kid in this country regardless of income can go to college. That's what a civilized nation does. Here’s the point. This is the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but nobody in America knows it because their standard of living is going down and almost all of the new wealth is going to the top 1 percent. That is an issue that we have to deal with. In the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, the top one-tenth of 1 percent should not own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Everybody in this country should in fact have at least a minimum and dignified standard of living. All right?

Will you help us reach our goal by making a contribution to  with as little as $3? The  conversation When Sen. Bernie Sanders launched his presidential campaign, few treated it as a serious challenge to Hillary Clinton. Sanders, after all, isn’t even a Democrat: He’s a \"democratic socialist.\" But his campaign struck a chord. He’s raised more than $15 million, primarily from small donors, and he’s turning out the largest crowds of the presidential race. But amidst all the media attention given to Sanders’s rapid political rise, there’s not been that much exploration of what he actually believes. So on July 16,  sat down with Sanders for a wide-ranging interview about his policy ideas and political theories. The discussion touched on everything from single payer to open borders to Zionism, but it began with perhaps the best-known but least-understood facet of Sanders’s political philosophy: his self-identification as a socialist. A transcript of the conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows. Here's the point. This is the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, but nobody in America knows it because their standard of living is going down and almost all of the new wealth is going to the top 1 percent. That is an issue that we have to deal with. In the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, the top one-tenth of 1 percent should not own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Everybody in this country should in fact have at least a minimum and dignified standard of living. All right? Tell me what it means to be a socialist. A democratic socialist. What it means is that one takes a hard look at countries around the world who have successful records in fighting and implementing programs for the middle class and working families. When you do that, you automatically go to countries like Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and other countries that have had labor governments or social democratic governments, and what you find is that in virtually all of those countries, health care is a right of all people and their systems are far more cost-effective than ours, college education is virtually free in all of those countries, people retire with better benefits, wages that people receive are often higher, distribution of wealth and income is much fairer, their public education systems are generally stronger than ours. And by and large their governments tend to represent the needs of their middle class and working families rather than billionaires and campaign contributors. When I talk about being a democratic socialist, those are the countries that I am looking at, and those are the ideas that I think we can learn a lot from. What is the underlying principle there? What are the situations where you look at a given area of the economy and say, \"That's something we should turn over to the market,\" or, \"That's something we should possibly federalize\"? Good questions. Health care, to my mind, is a right of all people. That's what I believe. I think every man, woman, and child is entitled to health care, and that right exists in virtually every other major industrialized country on Earth. We are the odd guys out there. Despite the modest gains of the Affordable Care Act we have 35 million people who still have no health insurance, and, more importantly, millions more are underinsured with high copayments and high deductibles. I believe in Medicare for all people, and I think that is not an area where private insurance companies should be functioning, because once you have private insurance companies their goal is to make as much money as possible, not to provide quality care. In terms of health care, yeah, we should have a public health-care system guaranteeing health care to all people in a cost-effective way. I think a Medicare-for-all, full-single-payer approach is the way to do it. In terms of education, I don't know how you have the United States being competitive in a global economy if we do not have the best-educated workforce in the world. What does that mean? It means that everybody should be able to get all of the education they need, regardless of the income of their families. What does that mean? It means we should go back to where we were 50 years ago and what Germany and many other countries are doing, and say, \"You want to go to college? You have the ability to go to college? You have the desire to go to college? Public colleges and universities will be tuition-free,\" because education must be a right of all people. It seems to me that when you look at basic necessities of life — education, health care, nutrition — there must be a guarantee that people receive what they need in order to live a dignified life. The argument people make about single-payer is that a tremendous amount of health-care innovation around the world is other countries freeloading on the amount of money Americans pay to induce innovation in the pharmaceutical sector, in the medical device sector. Do you worry that if we were successful in pushing down those prices, we would actually see a slowdown in health-care innovation? I don't. A lot of the money in health-care research goes into me-too drugs, copycat drugs where they will come up with another drug that really doesn't substantially increase the kinds of benefits that it has on the patient. In my view, the high cost of prescription drugs is a huge issue — it's an economic issue, it is a moral issue — and I very much reject what goes on in this country right now. Right now in America, uniquely among major countries, drug companies can double the prices for a drug tomorrow for no particular reason, just because they can make more money. We have seen that with name-brand drugs; now we're seeing it increasingly with generic drugs. I think absolutely that the cost of prescription drugs should be regulated. I will never forget taking a group of Vermont women across the border to Canada, where they purchased medicine they needed for breast cancer at one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States of America. I also find it very interesting that many of my friends who are great free traders, who want to see lettuce and tomatoes brought in from small farms in Mexico, have no problem with the fact that we cannot import name-brand prescription drugs from other countries around the world. That speaks to the power of the pharmaceutical industry. I talk to physicians who work in working-class communities, and they tell me one-quarter of the prescriptions they write are not filled. That is insane. I think we need to deal with the cost of prescription drugs very, very differently than is currently the case. You said being a democratic socialist means a more international view. I think if you take global poverty that seriously, it leads you to conclusions that in the US are considered out of political bounds. Things like sharply raising the level of immigration we permit, even up to a level of open borders. About sharply increasing ... Open borders? No, that's a Koch brothers proposal. Really? Of course. That's a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States. ... But it would make ... Excuse me ... It would make a lot of global poor richer, wouldn't it? It would make everybody in America poorer —you're doing away with the concept of a nation state, and I don't think there's any country in the world that believes in that. If you believe in a nation state or in a country called the United States or UK or Denmark or any other country, you have an obligation in my view to do everything we can to help poor people. What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don't believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we have to do everything we can to create millions of jobs. You know what youth unemployment is in the United States of America today? If you're a white high school graduate, it's 33 percent, Hispanic 36 percent, African American 51 percent. You think we should open the borders and bring in a lot of low-wage workers, or do you think maybe we should try to get jobs for those kids? I think from a moral responsibility we've got to work with the rest of the industrialized world to address the problems of international poverty, but you don't do that by making people in this country even poorer. Then what are the responsibilities that we have? Someone who is poor by US standards is quite well off by, say, Malaysian standards, so if the calculation goes so easily to the benefit of the person in the US, how do we think about that responsibility? We have a nation-state structure. I agree on that. But philosophically, the question is how do you weight it? How do you think about what the foreign aid budget should be? How do you think about poverty abroad? I do weigh it. As a United States senator in Vermont, my first obligation is to make certain kids in my state and kids all over this country have the ability to go to college, which is why I am supporting tuition-free public colleges and universities. I believe we should create millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and ask the wealthiest people in this country to start paying their fair share of taxes. I believe we should raise the minimum wage to at least 15 bucks an hour so people in this county are not living in poverty. I think we end the disgrace of some 20 percent of our kids living in poverty in America. Now, how do you do that? What you do is understand there's been a huge redistribution of wealth in the last 30 years from the middle class to the top tenth of 1 percent. The other thing that you understand globally is a horrendous imbalance in terms of wealth in the world. As I mentioned earlier, the top 1 percent will own more than the bottom 99 percent in a year or so. That's absurd. That takes you to programs like the IMF and so forth and so on. But I think what we need to be doing as a global economy is making sure that people in poor countries have decent-paying jobs, have education, have health care, have nutrition for their people. That is a moral responsibility, but you don't do that, as some would suggest, by lowering the standard of American workers, which has already gone down very significantly. Do you think service sector jobs can be made into high-wage jobs? Not only do I think they can, I know they can. If you look at what the culinary workers have done in Las Vegas, you have people who are cleaning toilets, who are making beds, who are making $35,000 or $40,000 a year and have good health-care benefits. So the answer is there's nothing magical [about working in a factory]. I mean, what we have historically seen in this country, until recently, by the way, is that if you worked at a union factory in Detroit —and this is changing, sadly, as part of the race to the bottom — generally speaking, you can make a middle-class wage, $20 to $25 an hour, you have good benefits, you have a retirement program. And that's being attacked every single day. There's nothing holy about working in a factory as opposed to making a bed or cleaning a toilet. In the case of workers in the hotel industry, we have seen with good unions they can in fact earn a living wage and good benefits. So is it fair to say, then, that your strategy for bringing back that middle class, for improving those jobs, is increasing union density? Oh, absolutely. No question about it. How do you do that? You do that by passing legislation which makes it easier for workers to join unions. Right now it is pretty hard. I'm not telling you every worker wants to join a union, that's not true, but you've got millions of people who do. Right now employers are able to take workers, put them in a private room, threaten them that if this company becomes union we're moving to China, or say that if you try and organize the union, well, you've been late lately, I'm afraid we'll have to fire you. I think we have to make it easier. There's legislation — which I support — the Employee Free Choice Act that says if 50 [percent of] workers in an agency plus one sign a union card, they have a union. And I believe in that. That legislation had, as I remember, virtually every Democrat sign on to it in 2008, and Democrats had huge majorities in Congress in 2009, and it just didn't go anywhere. What makes you optimistic it can be passed? I think what we need in this country is to understand that given the power of corporate America, the billionaire class, the big campaign contributors, what takes place in the United States Congress today has nothing to do with the reality of middle-class working families in this country. It has to do with the power of big money. The only way that real change is going to take place is when millions of people get involved in the political process and tell the United States Congress and any president of the United States that \"You have to start working for us and not just for the wealthiest people in this country.\" When that happens, huge things occur. Let me give you an example. Three or four years ago, the minimum wage was $7 and a quarter, and no one was talking about it. You know what's happened because of grassroots organizing? Not only have [cities] and states all over this country raised the minimum wage because of grassroots activism, what you saw recently a few weeks ago in a Wall Street Journal poll, by a 10 percent margin the American people think we should raise the minimum wage, not to $10.10, which Republicans oppose, but to 15 bucks an hour. Give you another example. Social Security. You have heard here in Washington virtually every Republican wants to cut Social Security, right? That's their mantra. You know what the American people want, according to that same poll, by a 3-to-1 margin? They don't want to cut Social Security, they want to expand Social Security benefits by lifting the cap on taxable income. When you organize at the grassroots level, whether it's gay rights, raising the minimum wage, expanding Social Security, that's when change takes place. I think a lot of people would have thought that the amount of grassroots support Democrats had in 2008 would've led to that kind of effect. Why don't you think it did? Because the Democrats, to a much too great degree, are separated from working families. Are the Democrats 10 times, 100 times, better on all of the issues than the Republicans? They surely are, but I think it would be hard to imagine if you walked out of here or walked down the street or went a few miles away from here and you stopped somebody on the street and you said, \"Do you think that the Democratic Party is the party of the American working class?\" People would look at you and say, \"What are you talking about?\" There was a time — I think under Roosevelt, maybe even under Truman — where it was perceived that working people were part of the Democratic Party. I think for a variety of reasons, a lot having to do with money and politics, that is no longer the case. In my view that is exactly what shouldn't be happening. Instead of spending all of our time raising money, I think we should go out organizing people and getting them to unite around a progressive agenda which expands the middle class, which tells the billionaire class that they cannot have it all, which says to corporate America, \"You're going to have to start paying your fair share of taxes,\" which says we're going to raise the minimum wage, we're going to make college available to all regardless of their income, that we are going to have pay equity for women workers, that we are going to create millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. You need a progressive agenda, then you need the ability to go out and organize people. When that happens, things change here; it's not the other way around. What does it mean to organize people? That's a great question. In terms of my campaign, on July 29 we will be holding, as I understand it, at least 1,000 organizing meetings simultaneously all over this country involving 20,000 or 30,000 people. What we will be urging our supporters to do is to go out, knock on doors, register the people to vote, talk about the important issues facing our country in a way that the media very often does not. Talk to our Republican friends and neighbors and ask them why they are voting for candidates who are prepared to send their jobs to China, deny their kids the ability to have health care or get a higher education, engage people in that discussion. I often make the joke, although it's not such a joke, that if we can spend half of the time in this country talking about why the middle class is collapsing, as opposed to football or baseball, we would revolutionize what's going on in America. I want that discussion. I want to know why the rich get richer and everybody else gets poorer. I want to know why the United States is the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide health care to all of its people, the only major country that doesn't have family and medical leave so that women can stay home with their kids when they have a baby. Those are the questions we should be discussing. You talk a lot about the class outcomes in the American economy. Another way of cutting a lot of these issues, and it came up when you talked about youth employment, is by race. Do you think we need specific issues to address the racial wealth gap, the racial jobs gap? Sure. Everybody knows that racism has existed from day one. Think about what people who came from Europe did to the Native Americans, the atrocities committed. Think about the horrors of slavery. Think about what we did to the Asian folks that came to build the railroads and the Asian Exclusion Act. Think about discrimination against Italians, Irish, Jews, virtually everybody else who was not like the people who were here. What we're seeing today is of course some people developing a wage issue between native-born Americans and those people who have come into our country. We have 51 percent of African-American kids who are unemployed, the poverty rates in the African-American community are far higher than whites, the wealth ownership much lower than whites, so of course we have that gap. What we have got to do is create economic policies that improve the lives of all of our people. The white working class is disappearing, the middle class is disappearing, and it's worse in Hispanic and African-American communities. We have got to come together and develop economic policies which improve the lives of all of our people. In terms of prejudice, yeah, of course that's an extra issue. Is there racism in America? Of course there is. We've seen an explosion of that recently. When you talk about the power that the billionaire class has over outcomes in American Congress, in American politics, a lot of the reason is that politicians end up traveling in the CEO/Wall Street class. How do you think the actual class of politicians' social networks ends up affecting political outcomes? The answer is you're right, but I would approach it from another way. If I am a regular politician and I need to raise $20 million to run for the United States Senate, or $50 million, where am I going to go to? You think I'm going to go to the American Legion hall? A trade union hall, talk to working-class people? Especially with the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, where we saw the candidates are increasingly dependent on the very, very wealthy. I'm a regular politician, and I'm proud, by the way, the vast majority of our money comes from working people, not from the rich, but if I'm a normal politician who needs to raise $20 million, $50 million, where am I going to go? I'm going to sit down with the wealthy, I'm going to go to the country club, I'm going to do my fundraisers at fancy resorts, and I get to know those people. But that's the whole point of this corrupt campaign finance system. If you're going to contribute a million dollars to my Super PAC, well, maybe it's you're a hell of a nice guy and you like to participate, or maybe you want something. I think you want something, and you and I are going to become really good buddies so I can do your bidding. In other words, the millionaire class and the billionaire class increasingly own the political process, and they own the politicians that go to them for money. I worry very much, and I say this from the bottom of my heart, that we are moving very, very quickly from a democratic society, one person, one vote, to an oligarchic form of society, where billionaires would be determining who the elected officials of this country are. I'm going to do everything I can to stop that. When you say you want to see elections be publicly funded, do you want to cut the ability to privately fund them? The first thing that I want to do is overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, which is a total disaster. Free speech does not equal the ability of people to buy elections, and what I've said is if elected president of the United States, any Supreme Court nomination I make will make it very clear that he or she is going to vote to overturn Citizens United. Second of all, I think what you want to do is at least make sure that candidates who are running will have as much money as their opponents, who may have unlimited sums of money. Thirdly, I think there are various ways — and we're going to come out with a position on it — various ways that you can approach the issue. One way which I find intriguing is that you basically provide $100 for every citizen in the United States of America, and you say to that person, \"Here's your hundred bucks, you can make a contribution, you can get a $100 tax credit if you spend $100 on any candidate you want.\" I think that would democratize very significantly the political process in America and take us a long way away from these Super PACS controlled by billionaires who are now buying elections. I want to make a turn to foreign policy. Is there a particular foreign policy school of thought you ascribe to? Do you describe yourself as a realist or a democratic socialist? I don't know what that means. I trust we're all realists. I'm not sure we are. I don't know what that word means. Look, here's what I will tell you. When you talk about foreign policy you're talking about many, many things, but maybe the most important thing that you're talking about is war. Voting to go to war is the most difficult decision that any member of Congress has to make. I'll tell you a little bit about my foreign policy history if you like. I was elected in 1990 to the House. You remember the first Gulf War once Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait? The first Bush was telling us the only alternative was war. The only way we can get them out — you have your whole world united against Saddam Hussein, and President Bush was saying the only way we can get him out is an invasion of that region. I voted no. That was a tough vote, because most people believed that we should go to war. In 2003 the second Bush told us that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, that it was absolutely imperative that we invade Iraq, that our soldiers would come home in six months, that we would establish democracy in Iraq and perhaps the whole region, everything would be wonderful. I didn't believe it, and if you check the speeches I gave on the floor of the House, sadly much of what I said about the destabilizing impact of that invasion turned out to be true. I'm not a pacifist, and I understand that sometimes you do have to go to war. I think war is the very, very, very last option. In terms of Iran, which is what we're dealing with right now, I applaud the President and I applaud Secretary Kerry for their enormously difficult work of trying to reach out an agreement with the P5+1 in Iran, to try to figure out how we can prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, which to me is an absolute imperative, but you do it in a way that doesn't go to war. I get very nervous listening to many of my Republican colleagues who apparently have learned nothing from the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, and they're ready to go to war again, that's the simple truth. I am the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee. Most people don't know that. People know that we lost 6,700 brave women in Iraq and Afghanistan. They don't know that 500,000 came home with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, and they don't know what that has done to those individuals and to their families. Before you go to war, you explore every other option. That would be the basic tenet of my foreign policy. If it came down to it, do you think it is worth it for America to go to war to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon? That's a hypothesis. You're asking me a hypothetical, and I surely applaud what the president has done to prevent us from looking at that option. You won't say if that was the choice whether ... That is not the choice right now. I've got to examine this proposal. It just came out the other day, and I can't tell you I've read every word of it; I have not. What the president has tried to do is to make it certain that we have a verifiable agreement that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I applaud him very, very much. That's where we are right now, and I hope after examining this treaty, I hope and expect that I can be strongly supportive of it. Let me ask you, then, not a hypothetical but a retrospective. Should America have intervened to stop the Rwandan genocide? Yes, but it's not just America. This is the damn problem that we face. We are spending more money on the military than the next nine countries behind us. Where is the UK? Where is France? Germany is the economic powerhouse in Europe. They provide health care to all of their people, they provide free college education to their kids. You know what? Germany and France and the UK and Scandinavia and the rest of Europe, all of us have got to work together to prevent those types of genocide and atrocities, and we have to strengthen the United Nations in order to do that. Do you view yourself as a Zionist? A Zionist? What does that mean? Want to define what the word is? Do I think Israel has the right to exist, yeah, I do. Do I believe that the United States should be playing an even-handed role in terms of its dealings with the Palestinian community in Israel? Absolutely I do. Again, I think that you have volatile regions in the world, the Middle East is one of them, and the United States has got to work with other countries around the world to fight for Israel's security and existence at the same time as we fight for a Palestinian state where the people in that country can enjoy a decent standard of living, which is certainly not the case right now. My long-term hope is that instead of pouring so much military aid into Israel, into Egypt, we can provide more economic aid to help improve the standard of living of the people in that area. Let me ask you about the economic side of foreign policy. I think one of the overwhelming background issues, and sometimes the foreground issue, is whether the economic rise of, particularly, China, but to some degree India and others, necessarily means a diminishment in American power and sway. Do you see it as zero sum in that way? No. I should also tell you when you talk about foreign policy, what you didn't ask me, which may be as important an issue as any, is the issue of climate change. If you talk to the CIA, if you talk to the Department of Defense, and I have, what they will tell you is that one of the great security issues facing this planet is the fact that as we see more and more drought, as poor people around the world are unable to grow the food they need to survive, you're going to see migrations of people in international climate. I happen to believe that when you talk about foreign policy, a the very top of the list is the need for the United States to lead the world, to work with China, work with Russia, work with India in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. This is not just an \"environmental issue,\" this is also a global national security issue as well. Do you think the international capacity and relationships exist to price carbon in a verifiable way? Yeah, I do, and we've introduced legislation to do that. Look, I happen to agree with Pope Francis and with virtually all of the scientific community. I'm a member of both the Energy Committee and the Environmental Committee. I listen to what the scientists say not only in America but around the world, and that is climate change is real, it's caused by human activity, and it is already causing devastating problems. It is an international crisis, and I have to tell you, without being overtly political here, it is an embarrassment to me that we have a major political party called the Republican Party, which with few exceptions refuses to even recognize the reality of climate change, let alone [be] prepared to do anything about it. That is an embarrassment, that you have a major party refusing to listen to science. Do you believe we need to price carbon? Yes. Would you do it through a carbon tax or cap and trade? Carbon tax. Why? It's the simple and direct way to do it, and I've introduced legislation with Senator [Barbara] Boxer to do just that. Once you're into cap and trade you're into all kinds of complicated stuff. Folks on Wall Street are going to make a whole lot of money. Look, we have got to come up and answer a simple question. Are the scientists right or are they wrong? If they are right they're telling us that the planet Earth will be 5 to 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century Fahrenheit. That will cause cataclysmic changes in terms of drought, weather disturbances, rising sea levels, acidification of the ocean, international conflict. If they are right — I believe they are right — we have got to move in a very, very bold way. We have to do it yesterday. Then that goes a little bit to the question of China and India. What do you say to countries that look at us and say, \"Well, you got rich off of cheap energy, now you're telling us we can't?\" That's a fair point and a good question. Let's understand that the United States could do everything right. We could transform our energy system tomorrow to significantly cut back on carbon. And yet if other countries are producing enormous amounts of carbon, the game is lost. It has to be a global commitment. It's not an accident that people in China are wearing surgical masks when they walk the streets, and their water systems are being destroyed. They have major, major, major environmental problems. I think the role that we can play with our scientific community is to work with these countries and talk about a win-win proposition. Can, in a few years, solar actually be cheaper than the more mature forms of energy, coal, oil? I believe it can. Wind, as well. But we have got to start investing in the kinds of technologies which are useful not only in America but work with China, work with Russia, work with India. These countries need energy. There's no question about it. No one should go to them and say, \"You've got to cut your energy in half.\" What we should be able to say to them is, \"We're going to work with you to transform your energy system to make sure you have the energy you need to maintain a strong economy,\" but it is not in India's advantage, China's advantage, Russia's advantage, to destroy this planet. Nobody gains from that, and I think many of them understand that. Do you think that the way Americans view China's rise in economic development is accurate or misguided? I mean particularly there, to go back to the question of whether it is a zero-sum competition between us for influence? I think",

        "articles": "Now that Donald Trump will be the GOP presidential nominee, Democrats are daring to hope that an anti-Trump landslide could lead to an anti-Republican landslide down ballot as well. And in Senate races across the country, the party appears really well-positioned to take advantage of this prospect. In addition to competing in a set of Senate contests that have long been expected to be in play, Democrats have managed to recruit well-credentialed and potentially formidable challengers in many \"reach\" Senate races where the party wouldn't ordinarily expect a win. These contenders are running mostly in red states, and most of them would likely lose in a \"normal\" presidential election year. But a backlash against Trump could potentially put these seats into play, so long as credible challengers were ready and waiting to take advantage of the situation. \"We wanted to have as many surfers on the water as we could, because we didn’t know how big the wave would be,\" a Democratic strategist involved in Senate races recently told me. Indeed, the surprise dynamics of the presidential race and the apparent strength of these contenders make the upper bound for Democratic gains very high indeed — north of 10 seats. With a strong performance across the board, Democrats could end up with 56 seats or even more overall, which is a very solid majority. After Republicans won control of the chamber in the 2014 midterms, it's always been clear that it would be quite difficult for them to keep it in 2016 — mainly because the GOP simply has many more seats on the ballot this year, with 24 at stake compared with Democrats' 10. This discrepancy is largely because this batch of senators was last up during the 2010 Republican wave, in which many Democratic-held seats changed hands, while the GOP managed to hold on to all of its own seats. The upshot, of course, is that Democrats get to pick and choose which Republican-held seats to gun for, while playing defense in very few races. Overall, even with a narrow Clinton victory, Democrats are very well-positioned to net the four seats it needs to take the Senate. And if there's a more widespread wave, and Democrats run the table in competitive races like they did in 2008, even bigger gains could make it much easier for a Democratic president to confirm more liberal nominees to the Supreme Court and other major federal offices, while bolstering the prospects for new liberal legislation. So here's a rundown of how Democrats could pull it off, starting with those lower-profile \"reach\" contests. These six races are mostly in red states, and none of these seats will be easy for Democrats to pry away from Republican hands. Still, Democrats are optimistic that they've recruited candidates who have the chance to pull off some surprises here — particularly if they're helped out by a national anti-Trump wave. 1) North Carolina: Sen. Richard Burr (R) vs. former state Rep. Deborah Ross (D): Burr, who joined the Senate in 2005, has long had tepid approval ratings. His challenger Ross isn't particularly well-known in the state, but she put in a strong fundraising performance in the first quarter, and Democrats are hoping to capitalize on the controversy over the state's new transgender bathroom law, which has been criticized as both discriminatory and bad for business. 2) Missouri: Sen. Roy Blunt (R) vs. Secretary of State Jason Kander (D): Democrats were thrilled that Kander — who's young, a veteran, and a formidable fundraiser — entered the race against Blunt, a longtime mainstay in Congress whom they hope to portray as a \"Washington insider.\" 3) Arizona: Sen. John McCain (R) vs. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D): McCain has been in the Senate for nearly 30 years, but Politico recently obtained a recording of him saying that with Trump at the top of the ticket, \"this may be the race of my life,\" because \"the Hispanic community is roused and angry in a way that I've never seen in 30 years.\" McCain still has to get through his primary, but Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick will be waiting and well-funded to face him in the general. 4) Indiana: Rep. Todd Young (R) vs. former Rep. Baron Hill (D): This is an open seat vacated by the retiring Sen. Dan Coats, and Republicans did manage to hold off a Tea Party challenge in the primary to get their preferred nominee. Still, Obama managed to win Indiana back in 2008, so Democrats are hoping they can return Hill — who lost his congressional seat in the 2010 wave — to DC. 5) Iowa: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R) vs. former Lieutenant Gov. Patty Judge (D): Grassley, who's practically a Senate institution, hasn't faced a serious challenge for reelection since he won his seat in 1980. But as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley has been closely tied to the GOP's strategy to block Garland's Supreme Court confirmation — which may have helped convince Judge, a potentially strong challenger, to enter the race against him. 6) Kentucky: Sen. Rand Paul (R) vs. Lexington Mayor Jim Gray (D): Democrats haven't had too much to be happy about in Kentucky lately, but they're hoping that Paul has been wounded by his disappointing presidential bid, and that Gray — who was the CEO of a construction company and is running on a message about creating jobs — is the perfect candidate to take him on. The top contests Democrats are targeting are six GOP-held seats in states Obama won twice, which party strategists refer to as the \"battlegrounds.\" These feature Republicans who swept into office during the 2010 GOP midterm wave but who haven't yet had to face a presidential year electorate (except for Florida, which is an open seat). In addition, all of these except for deep blue Illinois are presidential swing states. So Donald Trump is sure to frequently campaign there and dominate headlines, as Democrats attempt to tie their Republican opponents to the unpopular billionaire as closely as possible. (Conversely, GOP strategists are hoping to focus every race on local issues as much as they can.) Now, some of these GOP incumbents are formidable, so Democrats can't take too many of these races for granted. But even if the list of competitive contests were limited to these seats alone, Democrats would have a solid shot of retaking the Senate. Here are the presumed candidates (though in some states, the primaries haven't yet taken place): 1) Illinois: Sen. Mark Kirk (R) vs. Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D): Kirk has always been at the top of Democrats' target list, for one simple reason — he's the only Republican up this year in an overwhelmingly blue state. So he starts as a deep underdog, and Democrats landed their preferred candidate in Duckworth, a congresswoman and veteran who lost both her legs in Iraq. 2) Wisconsin: Sen. Ron Johnson (R) vs. former Sen. Russ Feingold (D): The liberal Feingold lost his seat to Johnson, an outsider businessman, in the 2010 GOP landslide. But Johnson has amassed a staunchly conservative record since entering the Senate, and his approval ratings have generally been underwater. So Feingold is gunning for a rematch, and has led every single poll tracked by RealClearPolitics so far. And to Democrats' glee, Johnson has embraced Trump, even coining the phrase \"the Ronald and the Donald.\" 3) Florida: Marco Rubio's open seat: Rubio's decision not to run for reelection has triggered a crowded five-way primary for Republicans, with no particular candidate looking particularly formidable yet. Meanwhile, Democratic Party strategists are desperately trying to ensure Rep. Patrick Murphy — and not the outspokenly liberal and controversial Rep. Alan Grayson — wins their own primary. (Harry Reid recently accused Grayson of corruption to his face and told him, \"I want you to lose.\") 4) New Hampshire: Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) vs. Gov. Maggie Hassan (D): Democrats landed their top-tier recruit when Hassan, the state's well-liked governor, decided to run last year. Yet Ayotte is popular too, having cultivated a pragmatic reputation on issues like drug treatment and immigration. Still, Democrats have hammered her for her opposition to gun control legislation and confirming Merrick Garland. And Ayotte had a Trump-related stumble recently, when she bizarrely said she would support Trump but not endorse him. 5) Pennsylvania: Sen. Pat Toomey (R) vs. Katie McGinty (D): Toomey was once known for his far-right conservatism (his GOP primary challenge to the late Arlen Specter motivated Specter to switch parties), but since joining the Senate he's crossed party lines on certain issues, like gun control. And McGinty, a Democratic staffer who has never held elected office, wasn't exactly the candidate of the party's dreams. Still, the party's strong backing powered her to victory in her primary against the mercurial Joe Sestak. 6) Ohio: Sen. Rob Portman (R) vs. former Gov. Ted Strickland (D): Like Ayotte and Toomey, Portman is viewed as a pragmatist who'd be strongly positioned in an ordinary year. But Strickland, who narrowly lost his governorship to John Kasich in 2010, is well-known in the state and neck and neck with Portman in polls. In a normal Senate year, each party would have to defend a fair amount of its own seats while trying to take some from its rivals. But Democrats' performance in the 2010 midterms — when this batch of Senate seats was last on the ballot — was so disastrously bad that they have practically nothing to defend this year. Out of 34 Senate seats on the ballot this year, just 10 are held by Democrats. Furthermore, only two of those are seriously being contested by the GOP, since the other eight are in very liberal states. And developments in these two races suggest both Democratic candidates begin as strong favorites. 1) Nevada: Former Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto (D) vs. Rep. Joe Heck (R): Trump will loom heavily over this contest to replace the retiring Harry Reid. Cortez Masto — Democrats' top recruit — is seeking to become the first Latina ever to serve in the US Senate. And Heck will face a tough time separating himself from Trump in this increasingly Hispanic state — if he survives his primary against the party's far-right 2010 nominee, Sharron Angle. 2) Colorado: Sen. Michael Bennet (D) vs. ???: By most accounts, Bennet only escaped losing in 2010 because a far-right Tea Partier won the primary. He'll be better positioned with a likely more Democratic presidential year electorate, in another state with a growing Hispanic population likely to turn out big against Trump. Meanwhile, the Republican side is in chaos. The party had tremendous difficulty recruiting a strong candidate, and while the GOP had high hopes for state representative and Iraq veteran Jon Keyser, he's currently embroiled in controversy over whether his campaign used forged signatures to qualify for the primary ballot.

        "articles": "A stunningly successful experiment has the potential to upend the mainstream US approach to deviance. Finding the best ways to do good. In 2007, the crime-riddled nation of Ecuador did something surprising: It legalized the gangs that had been the source of much of the violence. Then something even more surprising happened over the next decade: Murder rates plummeted. Ecuador’s approach to violence reduction is about as far away as you can get from America’s, which tends to criminalize gangs. To be clear, just being a member of a gang is not illegal. But because many gang members are known to engage in illegal activity, US law enforcement targets people it suspects of being members. It uses large gang databases (especially common in cities like New York and Chicago) to round up young people, often from poor communities of color. They may be deported or imprisoned for years. When we talk about criminalizing gangs, we’re talking about this punitive approach. In Ecuador, the unprecedented decision to legalize gangs across the country was basically a decision to adopt the opposite attitude. The country allowed the gangs to remake themselves as cultural associations that could register with the government, which in turn allowed them to qualify for grants and benefit from social programming, just like everybody else. This approach appealed to David Brotherton, a sociologist at the City University of New York who’s been arguing since the 1990s that US policy wrongly pathologizes gang members. So in 2017, a decade after Ecuador legalized gangs, he headed over there to conduct ethnographic research on major groups like the Latin Kings and Queens. It turned out they’d undergone a stunning transformation. The members were still very active in their gangs, but these were functioning more like social movements or cultural groups. Previously violent Latin Kings were working in everything from catering to crime analysis. And they were collaborating with other gangs they’d warred with in the past. Brotherton is preparing to head back to Ecuador for the next phase of his multi-year research, which will focus on a gang called Masters of the Street. He just won a Guggenheim Foundation grant in support of that work, which is how I learned about it. What he’s discovered has the potential to upend the mainstream US approach to deviance. I spoke to Brotherton about what he saw on the ground in Ecuador and whether he thinks that model can work in other Latin American countries and even in the US. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows. How did you get interested in studying street gangs in Ecuador? In the late 1990s, I was working with a bunch of groups in New York City, especially the Latin Kings. This was during the period of [Mayor Rudy] Giuliani and his policy of “zero tolerance.” I wrote a book on it in 2004. I thought that was the end of the story. Then I got an email from a social worker in Barcelona who said, “We have a group here called the Latin Kings, and we haven’t had gangs like this in Spain. Where are they coming from? Can you help us?” So I went to give a talk there. I said: “I don’t think you should do what they do in America, this ‘zero tolerance,’ because you won’t get to the root of the problem. You need to engage them.” They took that seriously and talked to the City Council of Barcelona. In 2004 or 2005, the council proclaimed that these groups would be known not as gangs, but as cultural groups. They found that the more they engaged the groups, the fewer problems they had. Then the city of Genoa in Italy adopted the same approach. They semi-legalized them, and the same thing happened. Then I got a call from Ecuador. In 2007, there was optimism there because [Rafael] Correa had won [presidential] elections on the platform of the Citizens’ Revolution: He said instead of just focusing on law and order, security will be based on social security. Someone close to Correa said, “What will we do about these street gangs? Their membership is in the thousands.” They came up with the radical policy of legalization. That took the Spanish thing a step further, because this was national, not just one city. The gangs responded very positively to that engagement. And that’s when Ecuador’s murder rates started going down, right? In your 2017 study, you note that Ecuador’s murder rates fell drastically after it legalized gangs — from 15.35 per 100,000 people in 2011 to 5 per 100,000 people in 2017. To what extent can you show that that was actually caused by gang legalization, as opposed to other factors? Statistically, you can only show correlation. And, actually, at first I thought maybe the crime rate was going down because the country had reformed the police. But we spent a year traveling around Ecuador and interviewing all the [gang] leaders. And when you hang out for a while, you see how differently they respond to conflicts now. For example, they [the Latin Kings] put on one of the biggest hip hop concerts ever, and they worked with other previously antagonistic gangs on the project. We found there was this fascinating phenomenon going on of peaceful coexistence. A number of the senior guys were working with the government or in the police force. Some were doing crime analysis. Some were in college studying constitutional law and social work. Some were getting into entrepreneurship, becoming caterers or graphic designers. How did legalization change the relationships within individual gangs, for example between men and women? The Latin Queens say they feel positively about the possibilities they have in the gangs since legalization. The more power the women get — and the women are very powerful, they’re in leadership positions — it helps in the positive transition of the group. Women soften the gangs to a certain degree, especially if there are kids involved. The family instinct kicks in. If you go to a large gang meeting, you might find about 700 or 800 people there. They bring their children — there’s maybe 150 kids. This sounds really positive, but there must have been challenges too. What did not go as hoped? Well, not everybody is on board. A lot of members of the public still believe in a more pathological model that says these are deviants and they’re not as prosocial as they represent themselves to be. The group members understand that stigma. They say they have to prove themselves. It also depends on the city. Guayaquil is a much more conservative city than Quito, so that’s not been easy. The politicos there don’t like the policy [of legalizing gangs]. They have to respect it because it’s federal, but they don’t put much money into it. How important is money here? In 2007, Ecuador was doing well economically. There was a lot of oil money coming in. Does a government need to have a lot of cash on hand when kicking off an initiative like this, so it can fund social programs that will support the gangs’ transition? These programs don’t cost a lot of money. They can do amazing things with just a little bit of money and political will. The government ministries spent a bit of money on social and cultural events. The minister of culture set up a train that went to the poorest communities in Ecuador to do street graffiti and art. There was a job training grant, and a grant to set up a community center. The Catholic University of Quito paid for 15 Latin Queens to study to become nurses. They never would’ve been able to do that before legalization. And it sounds like over time, those relatively small changes have had ripple effects. Yes, and a big part of that is because the policy was in place for 10 years [by the time we did our study], so trust and long-term relationships had a chance to build up. Some of these guys joined the groups when they were 18, and now they’re 28. They become the old hens and they teach the younger members, “Hey, this is how we do things now.” We call that “maturing in.” Is there a risk that gangs will be criminalized again when new political parties come into power? Yes, big time. When Lenín Moreno took power [after the 2017 presidential elections] everyone was wondering what would happen. All the people we used to work with got purged. They put new people in power. They didn’t abolish the policy, though. Right now there’s a decent relationship. The groups are working with universities, and they’re trying to convince the government that this should be a long-term policy, regardless of who’s in power, because it’s working. How universalizable do you think Ecuador’s approach is? Can it work in other Latin American countries? The mayor of Barranquilla, in Colombia, is planning to try to replicate the model. I totally think it could succeed in Colombia. About five years ago, the [Ecuadorian] gang members went to Bogotá to relay their experiences. They also went to Nicaragua and met with the police and community leaders there. Now they want to go to El Salvador. Do you think it could work in the US? Of course it could! Our approach, which we export to the rest of the world, is very moralistic and it’s very binary — either you’re in or you’re out. But it wasn’t always that way. Historically, we used to have street social workers [who worked with gang members]. Gang repression came about in the mid-1970s and got a massive boost in the War on Drugs. And right now things are getting much more complicated because of the deportation laws. So now you can only work with people in gangs if they’ve decided to leave the gangs. But if we had a rational policy … Well, we’re already doing part of it through the Credible Messenger Initiative that’s been tried in New York City, and right now I’m working on it in Washington, DC, too. It involves working with ex-cons, some of them were gang members, and they become transformative mentors to kids in the system or just coming out of it. An evaluation in New York showed that recidivism fell among kids [involved in the mentorship program], and the same happened in DC. Do you see your research as part of a bigger movement pushing for other kinds of legalization or decriminalization — of drugs, or sex work, for example? Absolutely. It’s all about a progressive, rational policy for social control. There’s this idea known as “deviance amplification” — basically, when you want to stop a behavior, the worst thing you can do is prohibit it. Social inclusion is the most productive means of social control. You have to have a system where most of people’s engagement with the authorities is as positive as possible.

        "articles": "Imagine someone had told you, a few years ago, that the FBI would soon be investigating a possible plot by a Republican presidential campaign to help Russia interfere in the US election — and that this interference had ultimately helped Donald J. Trump become president of the United States. You would have laughed in their face, or maybe accused them of confusing reality with a particularly lurid Tom Clancy novel. But we learned on Monday morning that this is absolutely, 100 percent, without a doubt our reality. FBI Director James Comey confirmed it in testimony before the House Permanent Subcommittee on Intelligence, telling the assembled representatives that his counterintelligence investigators were looking into the Trump team’s links to Russia. “[The FBI is] investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts,” Comey said. We’re so used to reports on Trump’s Russia ties that it’s easy to lose sight of the enormity here: There is an official FBI investigation into a presidential campaign’s possible collusion with a hostile foreign power for the first time in US history. Seasoned national security reporters, like the New York Times’s Matt Rosenberg, can scarcely believe it: Folks, let’s take a step back and absorb the fact that the FBI has confirmed there is an espionage investigation involving the White House Amid all the sturm und drang surrounding Trump’s fight with the press and intelligence community over leaks, all of the tweets, and hours of congressional hearings, this is what matters. We’re in the midst of what’s already a significant scandal — and one that could, depending on what the FBI uncovers, end up being the biggest political scandal ever in our history. And it’s not clear, judging by the behavior of the Republicans at the House Intelligence hearing, if our hyperpolarized political system is capable of handling it. The mere fact of an FBI investigation isn’t proof that the Trump administration has actually done anything illegal. But the fact that there is an investigation at all shows the suspicions are at least serious enough to warrant a full investigation. And in this case, the FBI’s suspicions are supported by a lot of information that’s already in the public record. We already know, for example, that members of Trump’s campaign, including former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, were in touch with Russian intelligence officers. We know that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who also served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump during the campaign, met repeatedly with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the election. We know that Russian intelligence hacked the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton ally John Podesta. And we know that Trump confidant Roger Stone admits that he spoke to the Russian intelligence cutout who claimed responsibility for the DNC hack (who goes by the name Guccifer 2.0). When you put this all together, there’s a clear and demonstrated pattern of contact between Trump’s closest associates and Russian officials. That is, in and of itself, disturbing: Political campaigns are not typically in the habit of communicating with countries that are currently bombing US military partners. What’s more, there’s also a consistent pattern of Trump administration officials being less than forthcoming about their Russia ties. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied about his contacts with Kislyak, as did current Attorney General Sessions. The lies cost Flynn his job and forced Sessions to recuse himself from the FBI’s Russia investigation. Yet Trump himself continues to deny, in the face of all this evidence, that there’s any story here: The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost! This is why, even if nothing else is uncovered, the FBI investigation is so important. The president’s team has links to Russia that are objectively worrying — and has a routine pattern of lying and blaming the media when confronted with them. There’s a question of fundamental credibility, of why they feel the need to dissemble, at stake here. The thought that the president may be lying, or at least not being fully forthcoming, about his administration’s ties to a hostile power is disturbing enough in its own right. The very fact that the FBI is investigating the administration two months into its tenure shows that things are not going well in the most powerful office in the world. But if the worst-case scenario comes to pass, and the FBI finds hard evidence that the Trump campaign was in league with the Russians, then the already serious scandal becomes a national crisis. “If [there’s] coordination, then this scandal becomes Watergate-like,” Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, tweeted. McFaul, if anything, understated the case. In Watergate, a presidential campaign authorized a break-in aimed at stealing sensitive information from the Democratic National Committee. This would be the exact same thing, only done digitally and with the help of a hostile foreign power. It would represent collusion with Russian President Vladimir Putin to undermine American — and Western — democracy. The notion that a US president could be involved in something like that should seem preposterous. The fact that the FBI is taking it seriously says volumes. If you want to understand how ill-prepared we are for a national debate over these allegations, look at Rep. Trey Gowdy’s performance during the hearing. Gowdy was, in the past Congress, the chair of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, the ninth investigation into the 2012 attack on a US diplomatic mission in Libya. His committee spent two years and millions of dollars investigating allegations that the Obama administration or Hillary Clinton had personally covered up the truth about what happened in Benghazi — and, like all eight prior investigations, found no evidence to substantiate these claims. So you’d expect Gowdy, advocate for truth and transparency that he is, to vigorously question Comey about Trump’s leaks to Russia. Instead, Gowdy spent a substantial amount of time naming former Obama administration officials — National Security Adviser Susan Rice, top aide Ben Rhodes, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch — and asking if they would have access to the identity of Trump associates whom the US intelligence community had identified as having spoken to Russians. Essentially, he’s suggesting the Obama team illegally leaked classified information in an effort to gin up controversy about Trump. “[By making] thinly veiled allegations against these former Obama administration officials by name … a member of Congress is intimating that particular Americans may have committed serious crimes,” a group of experts at the national security blog Lawfare write. This is an allegation that you’ve seen, without any real substantiation, in some of the more unserious corners of the conservative press. Gowdy, by forcing Comey to admit that these people could have had access to relevant information, was seemingly intentionally fueling a conspiracy theory. The Trump administration immediately jumped on this theory. Press secretary Sean Spicer highlighted it in his afternoon briefing to reporters. “Director Comey told the House Intelligence Committee that certain political appointees in the Obama administration had access to the names of unmasked US citizens, such as senior White House officials, senior Department of Justice officials, and senior intelligence officials,” Spicer said. “Before President Obama left office, Michael Flynn was unmasked and then illegally his identity was leaked out to media.” Gowdy’s line of questioning illustrates the way that most Republicans are handling this Russia probe: treating it not as an issue of major importance for the American public, but rather as an issue of loyalty to their president. The other Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee spent most of their time casting doubt on the idea that Russia would have wanted Trump to be president and lambasting leakers. In a normal hearing, it would not be particularly troubling to hear Republicans playing defense for a Republican president. But this isn’t a normal hearing. This was convened to discuss what are, best case, demonstrated lies from the president’s team about its contact with a hostile power. Worst case, it’s an investigation into a political crisis without precedent in US history. Yet in a political environment so defined by polarization, it’s hard for Republican legislators to think outside of partisan boxes. That’s how they approached the Benghazi investigation, when they were in the opposition and thus had an incentive to look for scandal; it’s how the party is approaching the Trump-Russia investigation now, when they’re in government and thus have an interest in turning a blind eye. This is a very serious problem. The New York Times reports that FBI counterintelligence investigations can take years and don’t often lead to criminal charges. A congressional investigation in which Republican lawmakers subpoena Trump officials and force them to testify under oath would be a vital way of providing the public with information about these extremely serious allegations. But Republicans, judging by Monday’s performance, seem to have no interest in providing this kind of oversight. Since they’re in the majority, they control whether or not there’s an official congressional investigation — and thus whether or not Trump officials will be forced to testify under oath. Partisanship may well be destroying our ability to get to the bottom of an issue of vital national concern. Monday’s hearing was stunning in more ways than one.

        "articles": "Elizabeth Warren didn’t run in the 2016 primaries and isn’t on the ballot in November, but she’s emerged as one of the most influential figures in Democratic Party politics. And an intriguing email sent by Hillary Clinton’s chief speechwriter to other senior campaign officials (then given, likely by Russian hackers seeking to help elect Donald Trump, to WikiLeaks) sheds light on what it is she wants from the likely next president of the United States: Not specific policy commitments, but a drastic change in personnel serving in key agencies. The meeting, between Dan Schwerin from Team Clinton and Dan Geldon from Team Warren took place way back in January 2015, long before Bernie Sanders’s insurgency had become a major subject of concern inside Clintonland (emphasis added): As follow up to HRC's meeting with Warren, I spent about an hour and twenty minutes this afternoon with Dan Geldon, a longtime advisor to the Senator. He was intently focused on personnel issues, laid out a detailed case against the Bob Rubin school of Democratic policy makers, was very critical of the Obama administration's choices, and explained at length the opposition to Antonio Weiss. We then carefully went through a list of people they do like, which EW sent over to HRC earlier. We have already been in touch with a number of them and I asked if he would be comfortable introducing me to the others, to which he seemed reasonably amenable. We spent less time on specific policies, because he seemed less interested in that. (Although he did express some flexibility on Glass-Steagall, said too big too fail is the bigger issue, and was open to our ideas on addressing through the tax code assuming it actually works.) He spoke repeatedly about the need to have in place people with ambition and urgency who recognize how much the middle class is hurting and are willing to challenge the financial industry. Starting with her speech at the AFL this week, EW will be pushing back against the President's message that the economy is getting better and urging us not to get distracted by metrics like GDP and unemployment when so much else remains wrong. Over all, it was a polite and engaged but not exactly warm conversation. They seem wary — and pretty convinced that the Rubin folks have the inside track with us whether we realize it yet or not — but open to engagement and to be proven wrong. He mentioned that everyone will be watching carefully any leaks about who HRC is meeting and talking to. We agreed to stay in touch and I'll follow up, including to ask for introductions to specific people he mentioned. Other emails from later in the campaign show Clinton’s team was paying quite a bit of attention to Warren, feeling (reasonably) that keeping her neutral in the primary campaign against Bernie Sanders was critical to winning. Sadly for those of us interested in economic policy gossip, there are no follow-ups to Schwerin’s note in the WikiLeaks archive. We never learn which people Warren recommended or what the Clinton team’s reaction to this information was. Reporting I’ve been doing on likely Clinton transition issues confirms something this email teases. Right now, there’s a fair amount of public messaging from progressive groups about a desire to keep people from the Wall Street world out of government, but the real agenda is more ambitious than that. Warren and her allies broadly object to the entire Robert Rubin/Larry Summers coaching tree of Democratic Party economic policymaking and are “very critical of the Obama administration's choices” in this regard. In other words, the mere fact that Sheryl Sandberg (who used to work for Summers in the Clinton administration) works at Facebook rather than Wall Street or that Lael Brainard (who worked under Rubin in the Clinton administration) has been in government and think tanks her whole career doesn’t mean they’d be regarded as good choices. The revolving door between Wall Street and government is a concern, but the real target is the whole network of people who’ve dominated Democratic Party economic policymaking for a generation. Warren has been repeating the slogan “personnel is policy” at every opportunity for a while now, but Schwerin’s email shows how serious she is about this.

        "articles": "A House committee could be less vulnerable to GOP obstruction. After hopes for a bipartisan January 6 commission went down in flames on Friday, Democrats may have a new plan to investigate the attack on the Capitol: A select House committee, which would not require Republican support to establish. Such a committee would differ from the proposed bipartisan commission in several key ways, but it could still take steps to ensure accountability for those involved in the insurrection. Notably, a select committee would be composed of members of Congress rather than outside experts, and the subpoena power would function differently — but, crucially, it could also be created with only a simple majority vote in the House. At the same time, a select committee could cast an inescapable partisan shadow over the investigation — and the failure of the independent commission bill underscores the alarming depths of Republican fealty to the Big Lie. Several Democratic members of the House have publicly voiced their support for the backup plan, which follows the defeat on Friday of the bipartisan commission bill in a 54-35 vote. The bill would have needed 60 votes to bypass the controversial Senate filibuster. ’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. For her part, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) hasn’t publicly declared her next move. But in a statement released after Senate Republicans successfully filibustered the bipartisan commission bill on Friday, Pelosi pledged that “Democrats will proceed to find the truth.” “Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans’ denial of the truth of the January 6th insurrection brings shame to the Senate,” she said. “Republicans’ cowardice in rejecting the truth of that dark day makes our Capitol and our country less safe.” Other Democrats have been more vocal in support of a select committee: Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), who served as an impeachment manager in former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial earlier this year, told CNN’s Manu Raju Friday that, with the failure of the commission bill, “Congress should create a select committee to fully investigate the causes and consequences of the insurrection on January 6.” And Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) tweeted his support of a select committee Friday: “Mitch McConnell thinks he can stop the full truth from coming out. He cannot,” Lieu wrote. “The House can empower a bipartisan select congressional committee to investigate the insurrection.” Mitch McConnell thinks he can stop the full truth from coming out. He cannot. The House can empower a bipartisan select congressional committee to investigate the insurrection. The select committee would also have stronger subpoena power because GOP Members can’t block subpoenas.  Previously, a bill to establish an independent January 6 commission passed the House by a bipartisan margin, with every Democrat and 35 Republicans voting for the measure. That bill was the product of bipartisan negotiations between House Homeland Security Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) and ranking member Rep. John Katko (R-NY), but was opposed by House GOP leadership. Gladys Sicknick, the mother of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died the day after the Capitol attack, also made an emotional plea for lawmakers to support the bill, along with her son’s partner, Sandra Garza. “Not having a January 6 Commission to look into exactly what occurred is a slap in the faces of all the officers who did their jobs that day,” Gladys Sicknick told Politico in a statement this week. “I suggest that all Congressmen and Senators who are against this Bill visit my son’s grave in Arlington National Cemetery and, while there, think about what their hurtful decisions will do to those officers who will be there for them going forward.” But though six Republican senators joined every Democrat present to support the bill on Friday, it didn’t clear the 60-vote threshold needed to override the filibuster. Eleven senators, including two Democrats, did not cast a vote — which essentially amounted to a “no” vote, given the filibuster rules. All told, the measure actually garnered less GOP support than did the February effort to convict former President Trump of inciting insurrection (he was ultimately acquitted). Technically, filibuster reform — an oft-discussed option that President Joe Biden has flirted with — would allow Democrats, who hold the slimmest possible majority in the Senate, to advance this bill and other contentious priorities. But at least one Democratic senator — West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, the usual suspect — has already said that eliminating the filibuster to pass the January 6 commission bill is off-limits, so Friday’s failed vote is almost certainly the end of the line for the bipartisan commission plan. In the absence of procedural changes, then, it’s most likely select committee time in the House — and there are some key differences between the two plans, including several which could work in Democrats’ favor. First and foremost, the makeup of a potential select committee would differ substantially from the original commission proposal. Under the commission plan produced by Thompson and Katko earlier this month, which resembled the bipartisan commission created following the 9/11 attacks, commissioners would have been required to have “significant expertise in the areas of law enforcement, civil rights, civil liberties, privacy, intelligence, and cybersecurity” — and no sitting members of Congress would have been allowed to serve on the commission. Additionally, Democratic and Republican leadership would have been allowed to choose an equal number of commissioners — five apiece, 10 total — with the commission chair appointed by Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the vice chair appointed by Republican leadership. When it comes to a select committee, none of that is true. As a House committee, the group’s entire roster would by definition be composed of House members, and there’s no requirement for an equal number of members from each party; its partisan balance could be determined by Democratic leadership in the establishing resolution. Significantly, that also means there could be fewer prospects for GOP obstruction in a select committee. In contrast to the defeated plan for an independent investigative commission, where use of the subpoena power would have required either majority support or agreement between the chair and vice chair — in other words, bipartisan agreement — Democrats on a select committee would be perfectly able to wield unilateral subpoena power. That’s a big deal because, as ’s Andrew Prokop wrote earlier this week, it’s more than likely that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) would have staffed their side of a potential commission with commissioners “prone to obstruct and object.” With a select committee, though, Democrats can look forward to the prospect of unobstructed action. Indeed, some Republicans voted for the bipartisan commission on Friday with the logic that blocking an independent commission would ultimately be worse for the GOP. “Without this commission, there will still be an investigation,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) said in a statement Friday explaining his vote in favor of the commission. “But it will be a House select-committee set up by Speaker Pelosi — the nature of which will be entirely dictated by Democrats and would stretch on for years.” “We can be more confident that the independent commission would thoroughly investigate this issue [of the lack of adequate security at the Capitol],” he added. There are also drawbacks to a select committee, however — some very real, and some still hypothetical. In the “real” column, there’s plenty of reason for Democrats to be worried about McCarthy’s potential choices for Republican membership on a select committee. Though GOP members won’t have as much power to obstruct as they might in an evenly-split independent commission, they could still do their best to turn the committee into a circus — and/or spend their time ranting about antifa and unrelated protest movements. And with GOP House members like Reps. Andrew Clyde (R-GA), Louie Gohmert (R-TX), and Paul Gosar (R-AZ), to name just a few, already engaged in full-blown insurrection apologia, it’s hard to see how the GOP conference would participate in a select committee in good faith. Rep. Paul Gosar offers unequivocal defense of the January 6 insurrectionists, describing them as \"peaceful patriots\" who are being \"harassed\" by the DOJ pic.twitter.com/b4Ijgvfz3V Another concern when it comes to a select committee versus an independent commission is the potential appearance of partisan intent, which could make the findings of a select committee easier to discredit. CNN’s Manu Raju writes, “Senate Republicans who opposed the commission said that if Pelosi goes that [select committee] route, it would be easier to contend that such a probe would be geared at helping Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections.” That’s possible, of course — and it’s certainly what Republicans will claim at the top of their lungs. But it’s less clear how much of a difference it will really make. For one, there’s a good chance Republicans would have taken the same line on the independent investigative commission. Though that plan was the product of bipartisan negotiation and had bipartisan, bicameral support, GOP opponents were already attacking it as partisan before blocking it for good on Friday. “[The January 6 commission] isn’t designed to produce a serious inquiry,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) tweeted last week. “It’s designed to be used as [a] partisan political weapon.” Additionally, as Washington Post political reporter Dave Weigel pointed out on Twitter Thursday, the findings of an independent investigative committee may well not carry any more weight with voters than those of a select committee. “The idea that a commission or investigation must be bipartisan or voters won’t take it seriously exists in DC and vanishes once you step outside of it,” he tweeted. The idea that a commission or investigation must be bipartisan or voters won't take it seriously exists in DC and vanishes once you step outside of it. Beyond the specific pros and cons of a select committee versus an independent commission, the Friday defeat of the commission bill proves more than ever why it’s important to proceed with an investigation of the January 6 attack. Specifically, the GOP’s grab bag of excuses for opposing the commission — that it was too partisan, or too narrow in scope, or simply redundant, to name just a few — all ring rather hollow. They obscure the real reason for Republican opposition to an investigation: the need to continue promoting the Big Lie — the utterly false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. As ’s Zack Beauchamp wrote earlier this month, the Big Lie is increasingly the GOP’s one and only animating idea. To revisit the horror of the January 6 attack, not to mention its precipitating causes, would fly in the face of party doctrine — and potentially implicate Trump’s allies in Congress for supporting and spreading inflammatory misinformation. As Beauchamp points out, Polling has consistently found Republican voters take Trump’s view of the election. An April poll from Reuters/Ipsos is a representative example: It found that 60 percent of Republicans agreed that “the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump,” with 55 percent saying the result came from “illegal voting or election rigging.” From top to bottom, the GOP has been conquered by the Big Lie. Much as North Korean state press proclaims that Kim Jong Il invented the hamburger, Republicans must now proclaim there was something fishy about Joe Biden’s victory. The result of that conquest has been a full-fledged effort by the GOP conference to whitewash the Capitol attack, which left five people dead and at least 140 police officers wounded. Increasingly, Republicans have pushed the envelope further and further in denying what happened on January 6, with party members like Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Georgia Republican, comparing the insurrection to “a normal tourist visit.” “Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol and walked through Statuary Hall showed people in an orderly fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes, taking videos and pictures,” Clyde said earlier this month in a committee hearing. “You know, if you didn’t know the TV footage was a video from January the 6th, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit.” i want to reiterate how crazy it is for Andrew Clyde to say this. bonkers. one of the craziest things i’ve heard uttered in a dozen years covering Congress.  As Punchbowl News founder Jake Sherman points out, Clyde’s claim is “bonkers.” But Clyde is by no means alone, and even those Republicans who haven’t gone quite so far over the cliff have made a cynical calculation that getting to the bottom of the January 6 attack is less important than winning back power in the 2022 midterms. “I want our midterm message to be on the kinds of things that the American people are dealing with: That’s jobs and wages and the economy and national security, safe streets and strong borders — not relitigating the 2020 elections,” Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD) told CNN earlier this month. “A lot of our members, and I think this is true of a lot of House Republicans, want to be moving forward and not looking backward.” Thune’s argument, however, misses the point: An independent commission — or a select committee, now that Thune and his colleagues have defeated the commission plan — wouldn’t be dedicated to relitigating the election (though Republicans in Arizona and elsewhere seem bent on doing so endlessly). Rather, moving forward without dealing more thoroughly with the events of January 6 would give free rein to the not-insignificant portion of the GOP that is now pretending the insurrection wasn’t all that bad, and to the even larger cohort of Republicans dedicated to perpetuating the Big Lie that fueled the attack. “To be making a decision for the short-term political gain at the expense of understanding and acknowledging what was in front of us on January 6, I think we need to look at that critically,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), one of the six Republican senators who ultimately voted for the commission, said on Thursday. “Is that really what this is about, one election cycle after another?” We have a request In moments like this — as people grapple to understand variants and vaccines, and kids head back to school — many outlets take their paywalls down. ’s content is always free, in part because of financial support from our readers.

        "articles": "For years now, a defining assumption of the 2016 race has been that the House Republican majority is fundamentally not on the ballot. But thanks to Donald Trump, one of the leading House election analysts in America says it may be time to reconsider that assumption. Folks, it may be time to rethink whether the House could be in play in 2016.  @CookPolitical Dave Wasserman is the US House editor of the Cook Political Report, the gold standard for granular analysis of congressional races. The story he's teasing with this tweet doesn't say Democrats are likely to win a majority in November. It really just says that he's downgrading Republicans' chances in 10 races. But it says that a scenario that was previously thought to be simply impossible is now in the realm of possibility. To see why a Democratic majority suddenly seems possible, just read Andrew Prokop's pre-Trump explanation of why it seemed so unlikely: Democrats currently need to pick up 30 seats to retake the House. The last time an incumbent president's party did that was 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won a 23-point victory over Barry Goldwater and Democrats romped nationwide to a 37-seat pickup. An incumbent president's party has not come even close to that since. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan each won 49 states in their landslide reelections of 1972 and 1984, but they only picked up 13 and 16 seats in the House, respectively. And landslides like those are all but inconceivable today in our increasingly polarized politics. When presidential elections are closer, the makeup of the House tends not to change very much. Democrats couldn't win a House majority because the only way to generate a wave election under normal circumstances is as a backlash against an unpopular incumbent president. The exception that proved the rule was 1964, when Republicans nominated an extremely unpopular candidate who deeply divided their party. That's a crazy thing to do, so most analysts simply assumed it wouldn't happen. And yet it's happening! The high odds of a Trump nomination and the fact that any alternative to a Trump nomination would almost certainly entail some kind of party-crushing convention hijinks mean that a Democratic wave is definitely on the table in a way it wasn't previously. But there is a big distance between possibly and likely. Recall that in 2012, not only did Barack Obama win a majority of the popular vote but more people voted for Democratic House candidates than for Republican ones. Nonetheless, Republicans won a majority of House seats due to gerrymandering and favorable geography. These advantages exist, along with the standard incumbent advantage and the reality that Trump would still be running in the context of a much more polarized country. That polarization could put a floor beneath Trump's vote share, or it could mean that center-right voters who won't back Trump will nonetheless vote to reelect a Republican House to check Hillary Clinton. Paul Ryan will probably be speaker in 2017 just as much as he is today. But while four months ago the idea that he might not be seemed totally crazy, as of mid-March it doesn't seem crazy at all.

        "articles": "Elliot Rodger is the most dangerous possible shooter for an age of media saturation. His chilling clips were on YouTube — and can be replayed across a thousand nightly news broadcasts. His posts litter forums, and more are sure to be discovered. His family is connected to celebrities. He was handsome in a way, and a student at a sexy, sun-drenched school on the California coast. His madness was a weaponized mixture of rich-kid entitlement, aching lonesomeness, and digital cries for help. He seems less like a person than like a character from an artsy slasher flick meant to comment on inequality, misogyny, gun violence, and online alienation. He will be irresistible to the media. And that makes him a threat even in death. The media will make Elliot Rodger a threat even in death There's a reason the media rarely reports on suicides. Sociologists long ago discovered that suicide is contagious — and media coverage helps its spread. There are guidelines endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, the National Institutes of Mental Health, the Office of the Surgeon General, and others warning against \"inadvertently romanticizing suicide or idealizing those who take their own lives by portraying suicide as a heroic or romantic act.\" They also caution media outlets against credulously relaying the testimony of the deceased. \"The cause of an individual suicide is invariably more complicated than a recent painful event such as the break-up of a relationship or the loss of a job,\" they write. But the national media reports ceaselessly on mass murders. Cameras are often there to cover the actual shooting, and they don't leave until weeks or months after the final press conference. Magazines profile the killers, lingering on their fashion affectations or their love of death metal or their disturbed art or the maddening realization that they didn't seem like killers at all. These are all natural attempts to understand a tragedy. But the end up glorifying the murderer — and possibly creating copycats. Sociologists believe that mass murder is contagious, too. \"The tornado of media coverage that swirls around each such mass killing,\" wrote Zeynep Tufekci at The Atlantic, \"and the acute interest in the identity and characteristics of the shooter -- as well as the detailed and sensationalist reporting of the killer's steps just before and during the shootings — may be creating a vicious cycle of copycat effects similar to those found in teen and other suicides.\" They also may be fulfilling the shooter's hopes and dreams. Unable to be the hero of his own story he decided to become the villain of everyone else’s \"Isn't it fun to get the respect that we're going to deserve?\" said Columbine shooter Eric Harris. He and his partner, Dylan Klebold, had hoped that Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino would fight to tell their story. Instead, it was Gus Van Sant who fictionalized their lives on the silver screen. In the New York Times, Adam Lankford, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of Alabama, summarized three motivations for suicidal mass murderers. The first is they are \"struggling with mental health problems that have produced their desire to die.\" The second is \"a deep sense of victimization and belief that the killer's life has been ruined by someone else, who has bullied, oppressed or persecuted him.\" The third \"is the desire to acquire fame and glory through killing.\" Every time a mass murderer wins fame and glory through killing it helps convince the next mass murderer that a shooting spree will give them the respect in death that they were never able to acquire in life. Rodger's writings are a sick mixture of megalomania and self-pity. \"I was desperate to have the life I know I deserve; a life of being wanted by attractive girls, a life of sex and love. Other men are able to have such a life,\" he wrote in his 141-page autobiography. \"So why not me? I deserve it! I am magnificent, no matter how much the world treated me otherwise. I am destined for great things.\" Unable to be the hero of his own story he decided to become the villain of everyone else’s. And, with the unwitting cooperation of 24/7 media, he will become a national villain. And other sick young men will see him get the renown in death that they have have never been able to receive in life. A vigil for the victims in Santa Barbara, California. (ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images) This is an easy dilemma to point out. It is much harder to solve. Even the act of writing this article contributes to the problem. I've described Rodger's life, his grievances, his writings. I've quoted from his manifesto and compared him to past notorious mass murderers. I've made him that much more famous. Tufekci offers some recommendations. \"There should be no reporting of the killer's words, or actions before or during the shooting,\" she writes. The name of the killer should not be officially confirmed until the trial. And she warns against \"stories about which guns exactly were used or how much robo-cop gear was utilized.\" This amounts, of course, to a kind of call for censorship around a national event. There are some precedents. She points to the kidnapping of NBC's Richard Engel in Syria as an example. \"The information about his capture, though obviously newsworthy, was held back in order to aid the negotiations and rescue efforts,\" she writes. But routinizing that kind of censorship is probably impossible, even if it was wise. Another possibility, though, would be to say less about the killer and more about the victims. The women and men Rodger shot had lives, too. They had social media accounts, and friends, and they made art and wrote essays. Perhaps there's a way to honor the victims rather than glorifying their murderer. Perhaps it would give future mass murders pause to know that they would be making their enemies into national heroes rather than making themselves into national villains.

        "articles": "Susan Collins is the first Republican senator to officially support the legislation. Maine Sen. Susan Collins is the first — and so far only — Republican senator to sign on to a bill guaranteeing back pay for federal contractors in the wake of the 35-day government shutdown. The bill would ensure that contractors, who typically haven’t received back pay in the past, also get paychecks for the time they missed as a result of the stalemate. Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN), who is leading the legislation, has now gained support for the bill from more than 35 Democrats, but no Republicans had officially backed up the bill until this point, according to a spokesperson for Smith. Smith and her colleagues say they are going to keep reaching across the aisle, with the hopes that Collins’s support could very well open the door for others to join her. “I don’t know of any Republican opposition to this,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), a bill co-sponsor, told . Van Hollen and Smith are aiming for the legislation to be included in any final spending package that funds the government before the February 15 deadline. In the House, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) has also introduced a companion bill. Many federal contractors, unlike other government employees, are not expected to get back pay for the paychecks they missed out on during the multi-week shutdown. Because they work for third-party companies that the government pays for their services, contractors don’t get paid when these services aren’t used. During past shutdowns, contractors have been forced to simply chalk up this gap in pay as a loss. As many as 580,000 contractors, including cafeteria workers, security guards, and IT consultants, could be affected by the shutdown in this way, according to NYU public service professor Paul Light. (Depending on the company they work for, some contractors may have received their pay uninterrupted during the shutdown.) For those who did see breaks in their wages, it’s a gaping hole they’re being asked to recover from with little recourse. “Thirty-five days is a historically long shutdown,” says Van Hollen. “The economic pain and damage was more severe [than past ones.] There are a lot of people who were left out in the cold for no fault of their own.” Contractors have told  that they struggled with bills for everything from medication to baby formula to child care during the shutdown. As the Washington Post reported, some contractors even saw their health insurance coverage put on pause because their employers weren’t able to cover worker premiums. While the shutdown is now over, its effects are expected to have an outsize impact on many workers for months to come. The Senate bill, which has been dubbed the Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act, would require federal agencies to work directly with companies that contract to them in order to provide back pay for the employees caught up in the shutdown. As Smith has explained, federal agencies have already allocated money in their budgets to cover contractor costs that have not been doled out because of the shutdown. Her bill would simply ask these agencies to pay out what they would have spent anyway. “If you think about it, they’re paying people for work they would have done but for the shutdown,” Smith said. “In many cases, that money was already budgeted; it just hasn’t been spent.” The bill is especially focused on providing full back pay for low-wage individuals, but would also offer some compensation for higher-income earners, according to Smith’s spokesperson. Agencies could provide workers up to $965 per week in back pay if the bill passes. The legislation would also create a special account to pay out these funds, the senator said, noting that it expands a mechanism that already exists for reimbursing contractors for shutdown costs. While legislation could help codify the practice of repaying federal contractors after a shutdown, agencies could actually directly pay out these contracts without any legislation at all, according to a union representative. “The public should be aware that agencies do in fact have the ability to immediately and single-handedly provide workers back pay, without forcing members of Congress into the long and uphill battle of passing legislation,” said Jaime Contreras, a vice president of 32BJ SEIU, a union representing building services workers. “In this way, federal agencies are holding a lifeline to rescue workers who are drowning in bills through no fault of their own. Agencies must fulfill their moral and financial obligation to repay workers for a shutdown these men and women had nothing to do with.” The Office of Management and Budget could direct agencies to examine their budgets and determine how much it would cost to cover contractor wages that were not paid out during the shutdown, the union representative added. Prior to the end of the shutdown, House and Senate Democrats had urged OMB to do just that. “Government contracts typically have provisions to modify the terms of the contract,” they wrote. “Federal contracting officers should use these provisions to work with contractors to provide back pay for employees who lost wages as a result of the government shutdown.” OMB did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Van Hollen said lawmakers haven’t heard back from the agency. As things stand right now, both the administration and Congress are leaving contractors in the lurch.

        "articles": "The national unemployment rate in October fell to 5 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday — the lowest mark of the Obama presidency. Politicians might battle over the \"real\" unemployment rate, but don't be fooled: The BLS data is trusted by economists, and Friday's new number is a key milestone for economic policy. Namely, 5 percent unemployment means we're on the edge of the 4.9 percent level that the Federal Reserve considers as necessary for \"full employment,\" Sho Chandra writes for Bloomberg. The timing couldn't be more important; Fed economists are meeting next month, and Friday's strong jobs report and low unemployment rate could encourage them to hike US interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. And 5 percent unemployment is an incredible symbol, too. Six years ago this week, BLS reported that unemployment had passed 10 percent, the first time in decades that the US unemployment rate had hit double digits, and a visible sign of how bad the Great Recession really had become. Obama can now argue that under his watch, unemployment has been cut in half. It's a striking improvement — especially when measured against Obama's predecessor. President George W. Bush inherited 4.2 percent unemployment in January 2001. That rate had grown to 7.8 percent when he left office eight years later and hit 8.3 percent in the first full month of Obama's presidency. The quick rise and dramatic fall of the unemployment rate during the Obama years is unusual. In the past 50 years, there's only been one other president — Ronald Reagan — who saw a bigger swing between high and low unemployment during his terms in office. (Under Reagan, unemployment peaked at 10.8 percent in December 1982. By his final full month as president, it had fallen to 5.3 percent.) Americans tend to praise presidents for job creation or blame them for economic collapse, but that's not entirely fair. For example, the early 2000s US economy was floating on the tech bubble, which happened to pop while Bush was in office. And near the end of Bush's second term, deep structural problems in the economy and global fears fueled the recession. But it's also wrong to say that presidents have nothing to do with job creation or the broader economy. Bush made the decision to enact major tax cuts, launch two wars overseas, and spend about $1 trillion on homeland security — and each one of those moves significantly increased the US deficit and contributed to a weaker economy. Meanwhile, Obama's January 2009 stimulus package and the March 2010 Affordable Care Act clearly affected the economy, too, and seemingly in more positive ways. For instance, the stimulus created about 2.5 million jobs, according to Michael Grunwald, who wrote a history of the stimulus called The New New Deal. \"Job losses peaked the month before [the stimulus] passed,\" Grunwald wrote in August 2012. \"The jobs numbers that spring, while grim, marked the biggest quarterly improvement in almost 30 years.

        "articles": "There’s one key shorthand to watch if you’re trying to figure out the state of the House race. Hillary Clinton has a healthy lead over Donald Trump in the polls. Republicans look likely to lose control of the Senate. Could Democrats hit the trifecta — and also take back the House of Representatives this fall? It’s not impossible. Even though most analysts think it’s unlikely — Democrats would need to pick up 30 seats, including in reliably Republican territory — there is one political analyst who has a theory of how it could happen. Geoffrey Skelley, who closely tracks congressional races at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, suggests there’s a crude shorthand for evaluating the battle for the House: Look to see if Clinton can beat Trump by 6 points or more in the presidential race. If that happens, Skelley projects 50 seats would be in play. If Clinton wins by 6 points — and current polling suggests she might — it would mean Democrats could have a real, genuine, honest-to-goodness shot at pulling off what looked impossible just a few months ago. By most projections, Democrats look more likely to get closer to 15 or 20 seats, not the 30 they’d need. Many states have gerrymandered safe Republican seats that would require an extraordinary landslide to do the trick. In 2012, for instance, Democratic House candidates won 1.7 million more votes than their Republican foes — and still ended up with 33 fewer members of the House. This is why even many Democrats believe taking the House is unlikely. But unlikely doesn’t mean impossible. Here’s the math behind how Democrats’ long-shot dream might just become a reality. Get a district to vote for your party’s presidential nominee and your party will also probably win its House seat. That’s not an ironclad rule, but it’s a pretty good indicator — in 2012, only 6 percent of districts that voted for Barack Obama voted a Republican into the House. This is the key to understanding why Skelley thinks a 6-point Clinton win could put the House in play. That kind of national victory would likely mean 50 House districts currently controlled by Republicans would vote for Clinton — therefore suggesting they have a good shot of also going blue at the House level. Of course, a Clinton win in these 50 districts wouldn’t guarantee House Democrats will pick up all of those seats. (Many are held by powerful or longstanding Republican incumbents who are well-funded and enjoy good reputations at home.) But it does mean that Democrats could lose 40 percent of the House races in districts won by Clinton and still take back control of the House. And here’s the interesting thing: The polling suggests this is not only a possibility but exactly what’s projected to happen. Averages of all the major polling firms compiled by both RealClearPolitics and the Huffington Post currently put Clinton’s lead right around the 6-point mark. \"A 6-point lead would help create the conditions for Clinton to pull the Democrats over the finish line to take the House,\" Skelley says. \"It doesn’t mean they would, of course, but it begins looking really possible.\" How does Skelley figure that a 6-point Clinton win would have her winning 50 GOP-controlled House districts? His model begins by assuming that the distribution of the national popular vote margin to the congressional districts will be exactly the same in 2016 as it was in 2012. This may be best illustrated by an example: In 2012, Obama won the popular vote total by 4 percentage points. In Skelley’s model, a 4-point Clinton win would mean she’d also win and lose every congressional district by the exact same amount Obama did. (Of course, this is bound to be wrong in some places — the distribution of Clinton’s vote share certainly won’t be an exact replica of Obama’s. But since there’s no way of knowing exactly how the popular vote will vary by House district from 2012, it’s a useful gauge of what might happen.) This is why a 4-point Clinton win probably wouldn’t flip the House. Obama’s 4-point win over Romney gave him victories in just 28 congressional seats currently controlled by Republicans. That wouldn’t be enough — remember, Democrats need a full 30 to take back the House. But what happens if Clinton expands on Obama’s national vote margin? Since Skelley’s model assumes the national vote share will be evenly distributed, every additional point in the national vote total translates into an additional point for each congressional district. House seats where Democrats tied or lost in 2012 become places where they win at the presidential level in 2016. If Clinton wins by 5 points, according to Skelley, she’d be projected to win in 39 House seats now run by Republicans. That would theoretically put the House in play but would give Democrats very little margin for error. But if she wins by a full 6 points, then 50 seats slide over to the Democratic column — at least at the presidential level, and maybe for the House as well. Now, Skelley isn’t the only close election watcher who is suggesting the House really might be in play. Princeton professor and election guru Sam Wang tried to take another stab at this question by looking at how much the Democrats would need to win the popular vote by to win the House, and then trying to figure out where the popular vote currently appears to be headed. What he found should encourage Democrats. With the exception of just two elections, Wang found that Democrats have always won back the House when they’ve won the \"two-party vote\" (voting that excludes third parties): Moreover, the current data suggests that they’re on track to do just that. Wang looked at results from something called the \"generic ballot\" — it asks voters to pick between the two parties, regardless of candidates — as well as the national presidential polling. \"If the election were held today, House Democratic candidates would win the popular vote by 5 to 8 percent,\" Wang said. \"Judging from the last few cycles, that level of public opinion appears to be right on the edge of being enough to give Democrats control of the House.\" The party’s leadership is taking notice. Top Democrats recently told the New York Times that they believe Trump is putting a slew of suburban seats in play that until recently looked like sure bets for Republicans. \"We’d need to win toss-ups or even safer Republican seats, but that’s what happens in a wave: People get sucked in the undertow,\" California Rep. Adam Schiff told the Times. \"And there’s a real chance of that happening thanks to The Donald.\" Still, many of the current projections don’t have the Democrats riding a massive blue wave. The widely respected Cook Political Report, for instance, thinks the party is only on track to nab an additional 16 seats. The Cook Political Report thinks only 33 seats are vulnerable at all, meaning Democrats would have to win 90 percent of all of the competitive races to pull this off. Last week, Emory professor Alan Abramowitz released a model for predicting House races based on the \"fundamentals\" of the race, including the popularity of the two parties and the number of seats at stake. He found that Democrats only have a 15 percent chance of taking back the House. Similarly, the New York Times’s Nate Cohn argues that there just don’t seem to be enough gettable seats for Democrats. He notes that Democrats’ ability to win back the House in 2006 was made possible by the fact that 21 Republican seats were held in Democratic-leaning districts during that election. There are just nine such seats this year. \"If Democrats are going to retake the House anytime soon, November would probably be their best shot,\" Cohn said in a story last week, \"and as of now it’s not happening.\" There’s an elephant-size question hanging over all the analyses of whether a Trump implosion could give Democrats the House: What happens to \"ticket splitting?\" Ticket splitting refers to the voters who back different parties for Congress and the presidency in the same trip to the polls. In 2012, only a record-low 8 percent of voters did so. If that number goes up in 2016 amid a Clinton landslide, it could give congressional Republicans a buffer from a Trump catastrophe. (Current polling suggests Republican congressional candidates are much more popular than Trump, but it’s unclear how many of the party’s typical voters will actually show up on Election Day.) This is why the X-factor of Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson makes these kinds of projections much more difficult. Clinton’s lead over Trump in most polls puts her about 6 points ahead, but that’s in part because of how weak Trump is — she’s normally polling around the 47 or 48 percent mark, and he’s closer to 41 or 42 percent. If Johnson gets in the neighborhood of 5 percent of the national vote, do his supporters vote for congressional Democrats? Or will they vote Republican down ballot — and make Clinton's big national lead less crucial? This is why Skelley thinks Clinton herself probably needs to win more than 50 percent of the vote to pull Democrats over the finish line. If, for instance, she’s just beating Trump by 48 to 42, then congressional Democrats might need Gary Johnson voters to go blue down ballot, which seems unlikely. \"If she’s only winning barely over 50 percent of the vote, I think it’s difficult to say with confidence that she’ll pull a lot of Democrats with her,\" Skelley said. \"I think she needs to really win the popular vote by more than that.\" It’s a colossal understatement to say that the stakes are pretty darn high when it comes to control of the House. If Democrats also go on to win the Senate, winning the House would open the doors for a raft of legislative priorities over climate change, immigration, and a range of other long-held blue sky policy goals for the party. So far, most chatter around a Clinton presidency involves big plans like infrastructure reform and new Supreme Court appointments. Sweeping Congress and the presidency would transform those ambitions into a wholly different kind. But there’s another, and perhaps equally important, reason this fight is so crucial: It may be Democrats’ last shot at the House for a very, very long time. New York magazine’s Ed Kilgore explains: If Democrats do fall short of what they need to regain control of the House even as Hillary Clinton becomes president, prospects for further gains in the near term will probably not be good. The party controlling the White House almost always loses House seats in midterms (1998 and 2002 were the rare exceptions), and 2018 would be a third-term midterm for Democrats, making the odds of an anti–White House trend even stronger. Beyond that, Democrats have a well-known midterm turnout problem associated with their heavy reliance on parts of the electorate — notably young people and minorities — that rarely turn out proportionately in nonpresidential elections. As for 2020, it’s worth noting that Democrats gained only eight House seats when President Obama was reelected in 2012. Many Democrats have certainly come to despise Trump over the course of a bitter and long campaign. But if he can blunder his way into giving them control of the House of Representatives far earlier than anyone thought possible, maybe they can come to forgive him.

        "articles": "The Laffer Curve — the idea that tax cuts can sometimes increase tax revenue — is one of the most influential and widely debated ideas in the past two generations of American politics. Beloved by the right and despised by the left, one thing that both sides have tended to agree on is that knowing what side of the curve we're on should be a key driver of tax policy. But in an era of surging inequality, it's time to revisit that assumption. Maybe at least some taxes should be really high. Maybe even really really high. So high as to useless for revenue-raising purposes — but powerful for achieving other ends. We already accept this principle for tobacco taxes. If all we wanted to do was raise revenue, we might want to slightly cut cigarette taxes. And since cigarettes are about the most-taxed thing in America, we certainly would want to cut out all our other anti-smoking initiatives. But we don't do that because we care about public health. We tax tobacco not to make money but to discourage smoking. The same is true of widely discussed proposals to tax carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. The goal here wouldn't be to maximize tax revenue, it would be to reduce pollution. The revenue would be a pleasant side effect. If we take seriously the idea that endlessly growing inequality can have a cancerous effect on our democracy, we should consider it for top incomes as well. With the growing concentration of wealth an increasing subject of public concern, it's time to reconsider whether the application of Laffer-style reasoning to very prosperous individuals is appropriate. Imposing a marginal tax rate of 90 percent on inheritances worth over $10 million, for example, would probably raise very little revenue. Rather than pay $90 to Uncle Sam for the chance to send $10 more to their kids, rich people would give the money to a tax-exempt charitable institution instead. That wouldn't help balance the budget — in fact, it would hurt those efforts — but it would help break the doom loop of oligarachy whereby concentrated wealth breeds political power breeds greater concentration of wealth. Even more intriguing would be to apply the same principle of taxation-as-deterrence to very high levels of income. About twenty years ago, Congress and the Clinton administration took a step that they thought would curb what they thought was excessive CEO pay. They said that salaries of over $1 million wouldn't be deductible from the employer's corporate taxes. Since that time, CEO pay has gone further up. Now the typical S&P 500 CEO earns 311 times more than his median employee. The reason isn't that tax deterrence doesn't work, it's that the authors of the law left a loophole big enough to drive $10 million through — you can deduct whatever payment you want as long as you jigger your compensation scheme to label it \"performance based.\" Imagine a world in which we not only closed that loophole, but imposed a 90 percent marginal tax rate on salaries above $10 million. This seems unlikely to raise substantial amounts of revenue. If you really really really really desperately wanted to give your CEO a raise, you would have that option. But for every extra $1 you give him, you'd have turn over $9 to the government. Why not use that same $10 to give raises to three or four people lower down the food chain who pay lower taxes? Of course, the CEO might threaten to quit if he can't get his raise. But what are his realistic options? Every company in the country would be faced with the same dilemma — why waste the salary budget on paying confiscatory tax rates rather than on hiring and retaining front-line workers? That might turn around the deplorable stagnation in earnings that typical households have faced over the past several decades: It's conceivable that America's executives would respond to their newly reduced wages by retiring en masse. But it seems unlikely that objective need to accumulate more wealth is what's stopping today's captains of industry from choosing early retirement. Of course not every highly paid person in the United States is an executive at a large company. Some of them manage hedge funds. Some are partners at law firms. A few are \"superstars\" in the arts or sports. Maybe in these fields we really would see a reduction of effort, or at least a relaxation of the intensity with which the performers pursue money. But would that be so bad? Imagine the very best hedge fund managers and law firm partners became inclined to quit the field a bit sooner and devote their time to hobbies. What would we lose, as a society? Fancy lawyers overwhelmingly compete against each other in a zero-sum game. Much of finance has the exact same dynamic. If the average \"quality\" of the trader on Wall Street declined slightly, nothing of consequence would happen. As for superstars, would it be so bad if celebrity actors became slightly more inclined to accept low-paying passion projects rather than income-maximizing commercial ones? At the same time, some would presumably just move to Switzerland or the Cayman Islands to avoid taxes. That would be a real hit to local economies, but hardly a disaster. Policy discussions of inequality in the United States are too often plagued by a somewhat artificial imperative to distinguish between efforts to \"redistribute\" income through taxes and transfers and efforts at \"predistribution\" that would alter the market structure of compensation. This distinction is crucially important when considering the fate of the poor — many of whom lack full-time jobs — since there is a large and obvious difference between cutting someone a larger welfare check and arranging for her to get a well-paid job. But when the question is the rich, the distinction largely breaks down. That's because the tax code structures even the \"pre tax\" incomes of very high earning people. Very high taxation of inheritances would mean fewer big inheritances, not more tax revenue. Very high taxation of labor income would mean fewer huge compensation packages, not more revenue. Precisely as Laffer pointed out decades ago, imposing a 90 percent tax rate on something is not really a way to tax it at all — it's a way to make sure it doesn't happen. If you believe systematically lower CEO compensation packages would mean a mass withdrawal of talent from the business world and a collapse of American industry, then those smaller pay packages could be an economic disaster. But the more plausible theory is that systematically lower CEO compensation packages would mean systematically higher compensation spending elsewhere in the corporate structure. Either more frontline workers or better-paid ones. The new tax code would redistribute value inside the corporate structure without anyone actually paying the new sky-high taxes.

        "articles": "It seems like there's one thing everyone agrees on after a mass shooting: The shooter must have been mentally ill. President Barack Obama said as much in his reaction to the Umpqua Community College shooting on Thursday: \"We don't yet know why this individual did what he did, and it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations may be.\" But what if the assumption is wrong, or at least misses the nuance of the issue? Jonathan Metzl, a professor of psychiatry, sociology, and medicine, health, and society at Vanderbilt University, argues that mental illness is often a scapegoat that lets policymakers and the public ignore bigger, more complicated contributors to gun violence. Metzl, who reviewed the research on mass shootings and mental illness in a paper for the American Journal of Public Health, points to studies that show people with mental illness are more likely to be victims — not perpetrators — of violence, and that very few violent acts — about 3 to 5 percent — are carried out by the mentally ill. And while mental illness can be a contributor to some violent behaviors, other factors — such as substance abuse, poverty, history of violence, and access to guns — are much stronger predictors of violence and shootings. For example, some studies have found that people with schizophrenia are more likely to commit violent acts. But other research has found that this propensity toward violence is almost entirely due to substance abuse, a common problem among people with schizophrenia who are self-medicating. And substance abuse — particularly when it involves alcohol — can make someone much more likely to commit violent crime. But the focus on mental illness after mass shootings lives on. In a 2013 Gallup poll, 48 percent of Americans said failure of the mental health system was \"a great deal to blame\" for mass shootings, compared with 40 percent who cited easy access to guns, 37 percent who cited drug use, and 29 percent who cited the spread of extremist viewpoints on the internet. This may reflect, Metzl suggested, the inability of many Americans to understand why somebody sane would attack and kill strangers. To dive deeper into the issue, I spoke with Metzl about the research and his thoughts on mass shootings. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images German Lopez: What do we know about a connection between mass shootings and mental health? Jonathan Metzl: In the work that I do, I construct arguments that call on the growing body of gun research in fields such as medicine and public health. One is that there's no real way of predicting a mass shooting. Mass shootings are very often statistical anomalies. The trouble people get into a lot of times is that they think, \"Oh, he must have been crazy or something, and a psychiatrist should have been able to see him before and predict it.\" That's a complete miss, unfortunately. As an aggregate group, people with mental illness are less likely than the general population to shoot other people, and they are far more likely [to be] victims of violence rather than perpetrators of violence. So I think this intense psychological profile of mass shooters as a way of preventing other mass shootings is really the wrong path to go down, even though it's understandable. \"People with mental illness ... are far more likely [to be] victims of violence rather than perpetrators of violence\" Point number two is that there is research that shows a certain proportion [up to 60 percent] of mass shooters do have some kind of psychiatric or psychological symptoms. As an aggregate group, mass shooters are very often young, white, paranoid men who've had histories of depression and possibly sometimes psychosis. So at least there are profiles that can allow you to aggregate some of these mass shooters into particular groups. But there are a lot of other factors that aren't linked to mental illness that are equally predictive if not more predictive: access to firearms, substance use or abuse, and past history of violence or arrests. These are all far more predictive than a diagnosis of mental illness — and they're more preventive in the long run. So while I do think there's a particular profile that many mass shooters fit into, the problem we get into when we diagnose the individual mass shooter and say mental illness is the cause is twofold. One, mental illness is really not causal for shootings; there's no mental illness that causes people to shoot other people. Two, focusing on mental health takes the shooting out of context. If you look at recent mass shooters, whiteness, for example, is a theme that runs through many, many mass shooters, but we would never say whiteness is a cause of this. It shows we collapse and oversimplify the roles of mental illness in shootings, and mass shootings in particular. German Lopez: The way I look at it is that there are some serious mental illnesses like psychosis or schizophrenia that might contribute to mass shootings, but the vast majority of people with these conditions are not going to participate in an event like this. Is that correct? Jonathan Metzl: Yeah. One of the major symptoms of schizophrenia is what are called negative symptoms: people with schizophrenia, they tend to stay home because they lack energy. So even though people tend to jump on schizophrenia as the cause of the cause of many mass shootings, if you look at people diagnosed with schizophrenia as an aggregate group, people with schizophrenia aren't more likely to shoot other people than are sane people. In other words, we might do better by looking at predictive factors from people we deem sane. I can't say that more clearly. I understand why people jump to this narrative. It's because mental illness is some sort of contributor. And killing strangers seems so far outside the bounds of civilized society and sanity that looking to insanity is understandable. But at the same time, there's no causal link between the diagnosis of something like schizophrenia and shooting somebody else. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images German Lopez: Are there any particular mental health diagnoses that you think can predict violence? Jonathan Metzl: I don't think there's any one psychiatric diagnosis — except for substance abuse. A lot of studies have shown that the presence of alcohol in the context of an argument when guns are present increases the chance that there's going to be a shooting by five to seven times. That's probably the most important psychiatric diagnosis to look at. Antisocial personality disorder has also in the past been associated with other kinds of killings. But again, we're talking about 32,000 gun deaths in a year — so it's really hard to pin down a specific diagnosis. German Lopez: What do you think of mental illness background checks for guns? Jonathan Metzl: I think background checks are important tools to help stem gun crimes, and they're often very effective. That's not just because of the diagnosis of the mental illness, but because there are predictive factors in gun violence, like history of gun violence and history of substance abuse, that these checks can pick up. Michelle Shephard/Pool via Getty Images Michelle Shephard/Pool via Getty Images German Lopez: It seems like you want to focus on a comprehensive set of factors. What kind of other factors are you thinking of? Jonathan Metzl: Well, we know that most gun deaths occur within social networks [such as family, relatives, friends, enemies, and neighborhoods], so we can look at particularly vulnerable social networks. Do people live in an area where there's a lot of tension or a lot of violence? If that's the case, we can intervene on a sociological level — not try to diagnose everybody with some mental illness. Access to firearms is huge, particularly in terms of gun suicides. [The research shows places with more guns have more homicides, and many experts believe the correlation is at least partially causal.] Has somebody attempted suicide in the past? That's another factor to consider. Another is whether somebody has a history of violence. It's much more predictive of someone's future propensity to commit violence than is a diagnosis of mental illness. So I'd ask someone if they have a history of assault or a history of arrest. Of course, there's substance abuse. That's another very important factor to consider. We need to acknowledge that it's complex. I think the question is whether we want to prevent the next mass shooting, which is very hard to do, or do we want to do things to prevent gun deaths across the country, in which case everyday violence is what we want to target. German Lopez: Is your hope that targeting gun violence broadly, including homicides and suicides, could help prevent mass shootings from occurring? Jonathan Metzl: Yes. I think that's absolutely right. German Lopez: What would you say to people and lawmakers talking about mental illness as the big contributor to mass shootings? Jonathan Metzl: Let me be clear. I think mental illness is a factor, clearly, in many mass shootings. But I think there is no one diagnosis that's linked to mass shootings, so there's no psychiatric test that can prevent a mass shooting. Mass shootings, as traumatic and horrible as they are, are statistically very rare, so they're very hard to predict. So I think we're far better off as a society trying to prevent everyday shootings — and when you look at everyday shootings, there really is no strong correlation between mental illness and shootings. So mental illness is important, but it becomes a scapegoat. It becomes the one thing we can all agree on — \"Oh, yeah, it must be crazy people!\" — but I feel compelled to resist that narrative because it gets us off the hook from looking at society, culture, laws, and other things that hit closer to home for people.

        "articles": "The Republican candidate who won in November likely won’t be seated before an official hearing in January. The new Congress will be seated in a matter of days — but it is almost certain that the seat from the North Carolina Ninth Congressional District will be left empty, as more evidence of a brazen vote-tampering scheme piles up. The bipartisan state elections board has refused to certify the results of Republican Mark Harris’s win and instead set a hearing on the election fraud scandal for January 11, a week after new members are sworn in. Harris beat Democrat Dan McCready by roughly 900 votes on Election Day. But those results have been marred by explosive allegations that an operative working for the Harris campaign collected, tampered with or even destroyed absentee ballots. The alleged plot is now the subject of a state inquiry; the findings of the state investigation will be presented at the hearing next month. Depending on the outcome, a new election could be called. The state board has broad discretion under state law to call a new election if the basic fairness of the November vote is in doubt. The number of ballots in question notably does not need to exceed the margin between Harris and McCready. The evidence continues to pile up. On Christmas Eve, Joe Bruno, a reporter for the local news outlet WSOC, added another piece to the puzzle. Three voters testified in sworn affidavits that they had filled out their absentee ballots and then given them to a person who came to their house and promised to deliver the ballots to state officials to be counted. Bruno checked public voting records and found that none of those voters had actually had their ballots counted. NEW: Three say they gave their absentee ballots to strangers who promised to turn them in to officials. They all said they don't know if they were turned in. I checked the voter database. There's no record of these three voting in the 2018 election. Story at 6 @wsoctv #NC09 pic.twitter.com/S0BFyyrrSm The picture isn’t yet complete, but the evidence we do have suggests that this could very well be one of the most duplicitous election fraud schemes in recent memory. Let’s tick through the evidence. It’s important to remember two things about absentee ballots in North Carolina: Anybody can request one, and, at the end of every day before the election, state officials publish a file of which voters requested an absentee ballot by mail and whether they have returned it to be counted. A campaign could wake up every morning and check that file to know how many registered Republican, Democratic, and unaffiliated voters had requested and returned a mail-in ballot. “From a mechanics point of view, this is a goldmine of information for candidates and their campaign,” Michael Bitzer, a politics professor at Catawba College, told me previously. With that in mind, here is some of what we know so far about the alleged ballot tampering scheme in the North Carolina Ninth Congressional District: That is a lot of smoke, and you can see the contours of the scheme: People working to support the Republican campaign were collecting absentee ballots en masse and serving as witnesses for them. But we don’t know a few critical pieces of information: Without the answers to those questions, it’s hard to say definitively what the precise scheme was — though the new evidence uncovered by WSOC suggests ballots may have been destroyed or discarded. There were already legitimate concerns those ballots were mishandled, given the testimony of ballots that were collected unfinished or unsealed. We can say that much for sure. But the list of outstanding questions is long. Another one: Were specific voters targeted? Jessica Dowless indicated to BuzzFeed News that ballots for Democratic or black (or both) voters were a focus, but later seemed to walk that claim back. Bitzer ran the numbers and found something odd about the absentee ballots in Bladen County: Harris would have needed to win every single unaffiliated voter and a good number of Democrats in order to rack up the margins he saw on absentee ballots there. But again, that data gestures at impropriety but doesn’t provide a smoking gun. That’s what we’re waiting on. Most of the attention has focused on two counties in the Ninth: Bladen and Robeson, in the southeast corner of the state near the South Carolina border. Notably, each of the affidavits provided by Democratic attorneys involved voters in Bladen County, and one man said that Dowless himself had stated he was working on absentee ballots for Harris in the county. Bitzer documented the unusual trend in those counties: They had a much higher rate of mail-in absentee ballots that were requested but not returned, compared to other counties in the Ninth District. And at the district level, according to Bitzer’s calculations, the Ninth had a much higher rate of unreturned absentee ballots than any other district in North Carolina. Bitzer also found that the share of votes Harris received from mail-in absentee ballots in Bladen was remarkably high. It was the only county where the Republican won the mail-in absentee vote, earning 61 percent to McCready’s 38 percent. Strangely, though, based on the partisan breakdown of absentee ballots accepted in the county, Harris would have needed to win not only all of the Republican ballots but also almost every single ballot from voters not registered with either party and a substantial number of Democratic ballots as well. Much like the sworn affidavits, there isn’t an outright allegation of wrongdoing to be found here. But the suggestion is pretty clear: Harris seems to have benefitted from an oddly high share of votes in these two counties, where an operative of his was allegedly working, and where a number of voters said that their absentee ballots had been collected from them in a highly unusual manner.

        "articles": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is up for reelection in his deep-red home state of Kentucky, but he probably isn't going to lose his seat to Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes. She's trying to regain some ground by attacking McConnell from the right — in the hopes that Kentucky voters will pay more attention to her ads than they do to the D next to her name on the ballot. In August, she ran an ad hitting McConnell for not supporting the coal industry. And now, she's running ads in Kentucky attacking McConnell for voting for...amnesty. If you read the small print, you'll see that the \"amnesty\" Grimes is attacking McConnell for supporting is the \"Reagan amnesty\" of 1986 — which leaves the odd impression that, for an ad attacking McConnell of hypocrisy, he's actually been remarkably consistent for the last twenty-eight years. But what's even weirder is that Grimes is running this ad while continuing to support a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. In fact, McConnell's been attacking Grimes for her support for the \"Obama amnesty\" — and she's put up a web ad of her own defending herself from those attacks, by maintaining that the immigration bill the Senate passed last year wasn't \"Obama's,\" and that comprehensive immigration reform isn't \"amnesty.\" Both of those claims are technically correct. But any Kentucky voters who would be interested in an \"amnesty\" attack aren't going to care about the distinction. Grimes' campaign is clearly trying to have it both ways on McConnell's \"amnesty\" attacks. For online and out-of-state progressives and donors, they're using the \"web ad\" to defend themselves in line with the Democratic party's agenda. But on television in Kentucky, they're running an ad trying to run to McConnell's right on \"amnesty.\" Notably, the new anti-amnesty ad is unlisted on YouTube —  found it thanks to a link on a Louisville Courant blog. That means it doesn't show up on Grimes' main YouTube page and isn't searchable — minimizing the likelihood that out-of-state supporters will see it.

        "articles": "One problem with the ongoing spate of speculation around Elizabeth Warren's presidential aspirations is that she's clearly not running for president. As Warren put it in an interview with ABC News, \"I'm not running for President.\" But you can forgive the political media for indulging in a little wishful thinking on this point. An uncontested Hillary Clinton march to victory would be boring, and the only viable candidate who clearly is in the race — Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley — clearly couldn't beat Hillary head-to-head and is best thought of as running a kind of Plan B campaign designed to put him in a good position if Hillary is unexpectedly struck by lightning or something. The real problem is the liberal enthusiasm for the concept — running from intellectuals like Noam Scheiber to union leaders like Richard Trumka — represents an airy, immature, dream-like approach to American politics that shows just how little liberals have learned over the past eight years. This is not a knock on Warren, who's clearly a very effective articulator of the liberal viewpoint on the main issues of the day. But have we already forgotten the last time a first-term senator from a solidly blue state beat Hillary Clinton in the primary by running to her left and then ended up disappointing his mostly highly engaged left-wing supporters by staffing his administration with veterans of the previous Democratic administration and governing in line with mainstream Democratic Party policy ideas? In fact, the main thing that ails liberal politics today is precisely the excessive focus on the presidency embodied in these Warren daydreams. Consider an April 28 Washington Post / ABC News poll universally viewed as full of terrible news for Democrats. For a bad news poll, it contained a piece of surprisingly good news. Slightly more registered voters said they were planning to vote Democratic than Republican for congress. The problem is that Democrats are scheduled to get creamed among voters who rate themselves \"certain\" to actually show up and vote in November. Just 55 percent of non-whites and 53 percent of under-40 registered voters say they're certain to vote, compared to over 70 percent of whites and oldsters. This more-conservative midterm electorate doesn't just lead to Republican electoral victories, it systematically shapes the conduct of Democratic officeholders. Every House and Senate Democrat holding a contested seat — and every party leader and operative in Washington — knows that they have to face a disproportionately Republican-friendly electorate in the off-years. Meanwhile, since Ronald Reagan's time conservatives haven't actually been very good at securing presidential nominations for right-wing heroes. It simply doesn't matter because, as Grover Norquist as explained, in an era of sharply polarized political parties all he really wants from a president is a Republican who's able to hold a pen and sign the right laws: Norquist is obviously exaggerating a bit, but on a fundamental level he's right. Hillary Clinton plus a Democratic congress will enact many more liberal policies than any Elizabeth Warren or anyone else plus a Republican Congress. That's just how the American political system works. None of which is to say that given a contested primary, people shouldn't support the candidate they like better. That's what they hold the elections for. But turning real or hypothetical presidential primary campaigns into your main vehicle for achieving political change is a recipe for a downward cycle of disappointment and despair. First liberals place unrealistic expectations on their would-be savior. Then when he (or she!) lets them down they become demoralized, exacerbating the problem, and instead of recognizing it they start looking for a new savior. Real change takes a much broader and deeper form of engagement.

        "articles": "Since Congress established Election Day, slavery was abolished and women gained the right to vote. Scott Olson/Getty Images This Tuesday, November 6, millions of Americans will embark on the same ritual they have followed for years: Every first Tuesday after the first Monday of November, they vote. But why is Election Day on this specific Tuesday in November? As the Federal Election Commission previously explained, this has to do with very specific considerations that Congress had in mind back in 1845 when it set a standardized voting day: For much of our history, America was a predominantly agrarian society. Lawmakers therefore took into account that November was perhaps the most convenient month for farmers and rural workers to be able to travel to the polls. The fall harvest was over, (remember that spring was planting time and summer was taken up with working the fields and tending the crops) but in the majority of the nation the weather was still mild enough to permit travel over unimproved roads. Why Tuesday? Since most residents of rural America had to travel a significant distance to the county seat in order to vote, Monday was not considered reasonable since many people would need to begin travel on Sunday. This would, of course, have conflicted with Church services and Sunday worship. Why the first Tuesday after the first Monday? Lawmakers wanted to prevent election day from falling on the first of November for two reasons. First, November 1st is All Saints Day, a Holy Day of Obligation for Roman Catholics. Second, most merchants were in the habit of doing their books from the preceding month on the 1st. Apparently, Congress was worried that the economic success or failure of the previous month might prove an undue influence on the vote! Essentially, Congress set up a day that would most accommodate a bunch of (white, male) farmers’ working, traveling, and religious practices. But as anyone with a cursory knowledge of history can guess, a lot has happened since this hypothetical white male farmer was the primary American voter — hence why, for many Americans, the timing of Election Day can feel very arbitrary and inconvenient. Consider just a few of the major events that have happened since 1845: the fruition of the Industrial Revolution (arguably the biggest event in human history), women gaining the right to vote, the end of slavery, black people obtaining the right to vote, and, most recently, the invention of the internet. In that time, the labor force went from around 60 percent farmers to below 2 percent. These events have, obviously, impacted how people vote and, critically, when they can vote. In general, people no longer find a Tuesday in early November a convenient time to vote thanks to a lull in their farming schedules. Instead, voting on this day forces people to navigate around the standard Monday to Friday, 9 am to 5 pm schedule that dictates not just when many people work but also when many people go to school or take their kids to daycare. Election Day has gone from convenient to very inconvenient. But state and federal governments have been slow to catch up with the times. Yes, 37 states now allow no-excuse early voting, but 13 either require an excuse (such as a work trip) or don’t allow it at all. And early voting days can be cumbersome — some places don’t allow early voting on many or any weekends, when it would be most convenient for many people with kids and busy work schedules to vote. And states may also limit early voting to weekdays during 9-to-5 office hours when people are working. On some level, the whole setup seems ridiculous: In the 171 years since Congress set the standardized Election Day, has really nothing changed that would necessitate a new official day for voting? Why should a bunch of dead farmers who lived in a country that still allowed slavery and banned women from voting continue to guide the day that most US voters exercise their most basic right? It’s just one of the many ways America’s voting system is outdated. Surely there has to be a better day for voting — particularly a day that’s on the weekend, when people are much more likely to have free time. Beyond changing Election Day, there are many steps that all levels of government can take to make voting easier. Here are a few possibilities, based on what some states and other places are already doing: All of these help address a serious problem: The US has relatively low voter turnout for a wealthy nation — meaning much of the population doesn’t have its voice heard. About 55.7 percent of the US voting-age population turned out to vote in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center. Other countries reported significantly higher shares of their voting-age population turning out to vote in recent elections: 87.2 percent in Belgium, 69.1 percent in Germany, and 63.3 percent in the UK. Some of the difference is explained by differences in policies. Unlike most wealthy countries, the US doesn’t automatically register voters (as Germany and Sweden do), and it doesn’t seek them out aggressively to push them to register (as the UK does). And the US definitely doesn’t go as far as Belgium or Australia, which make voting compulsory — an idea with some merit, as Dylan Matthews explained for . All of that, of course, falls on top of more typical voting issues, such as a lack of access to transportation to get to a polling place on Election Day or being unable to take time away from work or family life to vote. The policy changes listed above could alleviate these issues. Some of them, particularly the expansion of voting days, cost more money. It’s going to be up to lawmakers and their constituents in different jurisdictions to decide what the right balance of costs and access to voting is. But whatever approach one takes, it’s clear that there is a lot that could be done to make voting easier. And we can start by reconsidering when Election Day happens.

        "articles": "The challenge for anti-racists looking for solutions in Trump’s America. In 2016, researchers stumbled on a radical tactic for reducing another person’s bigotry: a frank, brief conversation. The study, authored by David Broockman at Stanford University and Joshua Kalla at the University of California Berkeley, looked at how simple conversations can help combat anti-transgender attitudes. In the research, people canvassed the homes of more than 500 voters in South Florida. The canvassers, who could be trans or not, asked the voters to simply put themselves in the shoes of trans people — to understand their problems — through a 10-minute, nonconfrontational conversation. The hope was that the brief discussion could lead people to reevaluate their biases. It worked. The trial found not only that voters’ anti-trans attitudes declined but that they remained lower three months later, showing an enduring result. And those voters’ support for laws that protect trans people from discrimination increased, even when they were presented with counterarguments for such laws. I’ve been thinking a lot about this research since Election Day. After Donald Trump’s victory in 2016, it is clear that the prejudiced views of a lot of Americans helped elect to the White House a man who’s repeatedly made racist, offensive statements. Not only did Trump build his campaign largely on fears of immigrants and Muslims, but based on a lot of polls and surveys, he also attracted the voters who reported, by far, the highest levels of racial resentment and other prejudiced views. Related One telling study, conducted by researchers at UC Santa Barbara and Stanford shortly before the election, found that if people who strongly identified as white were told that nonwhite groups will outnumber white people in 2042, they became more likely to support Trump. That suggests there’s a significant racial element to support for Trump. But just noting these racial attitudes and biases did not seem to have a huge impact on the election. Despite bigoted policy proposals that at one point even called for banning an entire religious group from the US, and the media’s constant reminders that Trump is racist, Trump won. Clearly, a lot of US voters either shared Trump’s prejudiced views or, at the very least, didn’t find such ideas to be fundamental deal breakers. That suggests there’s a lot of racism — or at least the enabling of it — in America, perhaps even more than one would think in the modern age. So how can we reduce this type of prejudice? The canvassing study provides a model for anti-trans attitudes, but can it be applied to other kinds of bigotry, such as racism, that might be more entrenched in the US? And even if we do embrace the canvassing model or something similar, how can we ensure that the conversations don’t lead to a backlash — the kind of defensive posturing and denial of racism that might lead even more people to support candidates like Trump? In talking with researchers and looking at the studies on this in 2016, I found that it is possible to reduce people’s racial anxiety and prejudices. And the canvassing idea was regarded as very promising. But, researchers cautioned, the process of reducing people’s racism will take time and, crucially, empathy. This speaks to the point Margaret Renkl made on Monday in the New York Times: “If … you’re a white liberal whose goal is to foster a more equitable culture, you need to stop yelling ‘Racist!’ at anyone who doesn’t see the world exactly as you do. Somehow you need to find enough common ground for a real conversation about race. Very few people are stupid or irredeemably mean. They’ll listen to what you have to say if they trust you’ll listen to what they have to say back.” It’s the direct opposite of the kind of culture the internet has fostered — typically focused on calling out racists and shaming them in public. This doesn’t work. And as much as it might seem like a lost cause to understand the perspectives of people who may qualify as racist, understanding where they come from is a needed step to being able to speak to them in a way that will help reduce the racial biases they hold. So how do we have a better conversation around these issues, one that can actually reduce people’s racial prejudices and anxieties? The first thing to understand is how white Americans, especially in rural areas, hear accusations of racism. While terms like “racist,” “white privilege,” and “implicit bias” intend to point out systemic biases in America, for white Americans they’re often seen as coded slurs. These terms don’t signal to them that they’re doing something wrong, but that their supposedly racist attitudes (which they would deny having at all) are a justification for lawmakers and other elites to ignore their problems. Imagine, for example, a white man who lost a factory job due to globalization and saw his sister die from a drug overdose due to the opioid epidemic — situations that aren’t uncommon today. He tries to complain about his circumstances. But his concerns are downplayed by a politician or racial justice activist, who instead points out that at least he’s doing better than black and brown folks if you look at broad socioeconomic measures. Maybe he does have some level of white privilege. But that doesn’t take away from the serious problems he sees in his world today. This is how many white Americans, particularly in working-class and rural areas, view the world today. So when they hear politicians and journalists call them racist or remind them about their privilege, they feel like elites are trying to distract from the serious problems in their lives and grant advantages to other groups of people. When Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called half of Trump voters “deplorable,” she made this message explicit. “Telling people they’re racist, sexist, and xenophobic is going to get you exactly nowhere,” said Alana Conner, executive director of Stanford University’s Social Psychological Answers to Real-World Questions Center. “It’s such a threatening message. One of the things we know from social psychology is when people feel threatened, they can’t change, they can’t listen.” Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist and author of Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right, provided an apt analogy for white rural Americans’ feeling of neglect: As they see it, they are all in this line toward a hill with prosperity at the top. But over the past few years, globalization and income stagnation have caused the line to stop moving. And from their perspective, people — black and brown Americans, women — are now cutting in the line, because they’re getting new (and more equal) opportunities through new anti-discrimination laws and policies like affirmative action. As a result, Hochschild told me that rural white Americans “feel like a minority group. They feel like a disappearing group. Both minority and invisible.” One can pick the facts here — particularly since black and Latino Americans still trail white Americans in terms of wealth, income, and educational attainment. But this is how many white Americans feel, regardless of the facts. So when they hear accusations of racism, they feel like what they see as the “real” issues — those that afflict them — are getting neglected. This, obviously, makes it difficult to raise issues of race at all with big segments of the population, because they’re often suspicious of the motives. What’s more, accusations of racism can cause white Americans to become incredibly defensive — to the point that they might reinforce white supremacy. Robin DiAngelo, who studies race at Westfield State University, described this phenomenon as “white fragility” in a groundbreaking 2011 paper: White people in North America live in a social environment that protects and insulates them from race-based stress. This insulated environment of racial protection builds white expectations for racial comfort while at the same time lowering the ability to tolerate racial stress, leading to what I refer to as White Fragility. White Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium. Most Americans, white people included, want to think that they’re not capable of racism — particularly after the civil rights movement, overt racism is widely viewed as unacceptable in American society. Yet racism, obviously, still exists. And when some white people are confronted with that reality, whether it’s accusations of racism against them personally or more broadly, they immediately become very defensive — even hostile. “Most of us live in racial segregation,” DiAngelo told me. “Our teachers are white. Our role models are white. Our heroes and heroines are white. That insulation is very rarely challenged.” She added, “So when that reality is questioned, we don’t tend to handle it very well.” DiAngelo’s paper explained that white Americans have a range of “triggers” that make them defensive about race, from suggestions that a person’s viewpoint is racialized to the rise of people of color into prominent leadership positions. All the triggers that she listed were present in 2016 — through President Barack Obama’s elections and Black Lives Matter protests against the dominance of white privilege. Consider how often throughout the 2016 election people would respond to even the slightest suggestion of racism, whether in media or everyday life, with immediate vitriol, disdain, or dismissal. This, DiAngelo argued, is a defense mechanism to confronting questions about privilege. And it makes it difficult to have a reasonable conversation about race. DiAngelo offered a telling example, from an anti-racism training session she facilitated: One of the white participants left the session and went back to her desk, upset at receiving (what appeared to the training team as) sensitive and diplomatic feedback on how some of her statements had impacted several people of color in the room. At break, several other white participants approached us (the trainers) and reported that they had talked to the woman at her desk, and she was very upset that her statements had been challenged. They wanted to alert us to the fact that she literally “might be having a heart-attack.” Upon questioning from us, they clarified that they meant this literally. These co-workers were sincere in their fear that the young woman might actually physically die as a result of the feedback. Of course, when news of the woman’s potentially fatal condition reached the rest of the participant group, all attention was immediately focused back onto her and away from the impact she had had on the people of color. This illustrates just how defensive people can get in the face of accusations of racism: Not only did the woman who faced the criticisms genuinely feel like she was having a heart attack, but the white people around her believed it was totally possible she was. This is the reality of trying to have a conversation about race in America. The innate resistance and defensiveness to conversations about bigotry don’t mean that you should never talk about racism, sexism, homophobia, or other kinds of hate. But those conversations may have to be held more tactfully — positioning people into a more receptive position to hear what these problems are all about. One key issue is that people want to feel heard before they can open their minds to other people’s points of view. “Democrats in particular need to go out of their way to reassure these groups that they are being respected, that they are being listened to,” Conner said. That was crucial in Broockman and Kalla’s transgender canvassing study. In a traditional canvassing session, the canvasser does most of the talking — throwing out all sorts of statistics and reasons the person on the other side of the door should take a specific side on a certain issue. But in the transgender canvassing study, the person getting canvassed often did as much or even more of the talking. As one example, consider an actual conversation from the study, as reported by Brian Resnick for : In the beginning of their conversation, Virginia asks Gustavo how likely he'd be to support transgender rights legislation. Gustavo says he wouldn't support it because he's worried about predatory men using the law as an opportunity to enter women's bathrooms. Virginia asks why he feels that way. \"I'm from South America, and in South America we don't like fags,\" he tells her. This next moment is crucial: Virginia doesn't jump on Gustavo for the slur, and instead says, \"I'm gay,\" in a friendly manner. Gustavo doesn't recoil. Actually, he becomes more interested. Gustavo and Virginia go on to discuss how much they love their partners, and how that love helps them overcome adversity. Gustavo tells Virginia that his wife is a disabled person. \"God gave me the ability to love a disabled person,\" he says, and that taking care of one another is why love matters. \"That resonate a lots with me,\" Virginia responds. \"For me, these laws, and including transgender people are about that. They're about how we treat one another.\" Now that Gustavo is in a place where he's more open, Virginia asks him to imagine what the worst thing could happen if he used a bathroom with a transgender person. He admits he wouldn't be scared. Then comes the breakthrough. \"Listen, probably I was mistaken,\" he says of his original position on trans rights. Virginia asks him again if he'd vote in favor of banning transgender discrimination. \"In favor,\" he says. Hochschild shared similar stories in her book. In one example, a woman tells Hochschild about her love for conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh because he stood up to people — feminists, environmentalists, and other liberals — that she felt belittled her and her lifestyle. As the woman explained, “Oh, liberals think that Bible-believing Southerners are ignorant, backward, rednecks, losers. They think we’re racist, sexist, homophobic, and maybe fat.” She felt that these accusations overlooked many of the problems that rural white Americans faced — growing up poor, struggling to get a better education, and so on. Because Hochschild, who’s liberal, didn’t immediately dismiss the woman’s comments and insult her, the two managed to have a frank conversation to reach a better understanding of each other. And the two continued talking as Hochschild wrote her book. From one simple exchange of empathy, it was possible to have more frank conversations. “You can turn your political alarm system off without jeopardizing who you are and what you believe,” Hochschild told me. “And you can learn something about the person at the other end of the conversation that’s going to be of profound importance.” These stories, from the canvassing study and Hochschild’s research, demonstrate a key point: People don’t want to be immediately dismissed because they might have a view that you consider wrong or even vile; they want to feel heard. And once that happens, it’s a lot easier for them to make mental space to understand other people’s problems. Of course, there is a balance to strike here. Insofar as absolutely any mention of racism triggers a backlash among some people, that may just be an unavoidable consequence of a long-neglected but necessary conversation. After all, we can’t just ignore the real racial disparities in policing, the criminal justice system, health, wealth, housing, and nearly every other aspect of American life until everyone is ready to talk about these issues openly. We could be waiting forever if we did that. And the work of reducing racial bias can’t fall solely on people of color. White Americans need to work within their own communities to combat prejudice. Thankfully, researchers have come up with several ideas that strike the right balance. One approach is to pursue certain policies in a race-neutral manner. For example, equipping police with body cameras has become a prominent idea in response to the police shootings of black men over the past few years. But the inherent idea behind body cameras doesn’t have to be racial — it can just be about generally holding police accountable, no matter whom they’re interacting with. And indeed, polls have found that support for body cameras on police officers in general hovers above 90 percent. But this approach has its limits. Some issues have an explicit racial element to them, so the conversation about these problems has to bring in racism at some point. In the face of resistance, then, actually reducing people’s racial anxieties — rather than glossing over them — is necessary. This will require conversations. Maybe it will be through canvassing by activists, much like the transgender study. Maybe churches and schools can take on public education campaigns. Maybe these and other civic institutions can facilitate public forums in which people can openly discuss these problems. But how, exactly, should those conversations and campaigns take form — in a way that can meaningfully reduce or eliminate racial prejudice? “We can’t pretend we’re post-racial, because that’s absurd,” said Rachel Godsil, co-founder and director of research at the Perception Institute. “But we need to work past the idea that our divisions will prevent us from coming together, from solving problems collectively.” In The Science of Equality, Godsil and her co-authors proposed several tactics that seem, based on the research, promising: presenting people with examples that break stereotypes, asking them to think about people of color as individuals rather than as a group, tasking them with taking on first-person perspectives of people of color, and increasing contact between people of different races. All of these interventions appear to reduce subconscious racial biases, while interracial contact appears most promising for reducing racial anxiety more broadly. Of course, interracial contact can be hard to achieve in communities that are racially homogeneous — in other words, a lot of rural white communities. But the researchers note that even indirect contact — for example, knowing that one of your white neighbors is friends with a person of color — can reduce prejudice, suggesting there are ways to reduce racial anxiety without direct contact. Godsil and her team also put forward tactics that can help people limit actions based on racial biases, such as getting people to slow down in their decision-making and teaching them about how subconscious processes can influence their impulses — even on issues unrelated to race — in order to push them to question their own objectivity. The research suggests these ideas have potential, but they generally seem to require that people are genuinely willing to reduce their biased behavior and actions. More broadly, people need to be shown that people of different races can live and thrive in diverse communities. Trump supporters are clearly worried, as the earlier study found, that white Americans are losing status in the country. But there are plenty of examples — in big, diverse cities like New York City, for example — that show they don’t have to look at race relations in a zero-sum manner in which white people lose and everyone else wins. The empirical research, after all, shows that more immigration can ultimately lift up the entire country’s economy, benefiting everyone. “There’s an unfortunate lack of understanding that interactions across groups can be positive and enrich rather than divide,” Godsil said. “That’s what people who do live in pretty homogeneous parts of the country just don’t know. They’ve never experienced it.” So how do you get people to see that diversity isn’t a threat to them? Godsil pointed to the transgender canvassing study as one example. Perhaps nonconfrontational conversations with people of color in which both parties share their lived experiences could go a long way to demonstrating that different racial groups don’t have to be at odds. And white Americans could engage in these types of dialogues with other white people to help open their minds to another perspective. But there’s other ways too, from creating local spaces in which people can talk about race issues and air out their fears to more formal public education campaigns. The key to these conversations, though, is empathy. And it will take a lot of empathy — not just for one conversation but many, many conversations in several settings over possibly many years. It won’t be easy, but if we want to address some people’s deeply entrenched racial attitudes, it may be the only way.

        "articles": "Everybody knows Hillary Clinton, and everybody particularly knows her foreign policy views. After all, she has been a presence in national politics for more than 25 years and has a long record as first lady, senator, and secretary of state. Most believe that Hillary Clinton is a \"hawk\" on foreign policy, and that as president, she would escalate current US military commitments in the Middle East and elsewhere, dragging America into more military misadventures in various far-flung corners of the world. For instance, the New York Times’ Mark Landler writes that \"her affinity for the armed forces is rooted in a lifelong belief that the calculated use of military power is vital to defending national interests, that American intervention does more good than harm.\" Clinton has indeed often favored the use of force. But President Hillary Clinton would not likely be the uber hawk that so many expect. First, her record is in fact more nuanced than is often appreciated — she has just as often pushed for diplomatic solutions as military ones. But more importantly, it is because, as president, she will find that the use of force abroad will offer precious few opportunities for making a difference, and will come at a considerable political cost at home. Portrayals of Hillary Clinton as super-hawkish on foreign policy typically point to a number of decisions she’s made over the years to support the use military force. As first lady in the 1990s, she supported US intervention in the former Yugoslavia. As a senator, she voted for the war in Iraq in 2003. She supported the troop surge in Afghanistan in 2009. As secretary of state, she advocated military intervention in Libya in 2011 and forceful measures in Syria (for example, the early arming of the moderate opposition and more recently the creation of safe or no-fly zones). Where others wavered, she supported the use of force to kill Osama bin Laden. On the campaign trail, she has supported President Barack Obama’s decisions to deploy more special forces and intensify air strikes against the ISIS. Many of her advisers are prominent advocates of increased use of the military, particularly in Syria. So it’s easy to look at her history and her belief in American leadership and exceptionalism and conclude that there will be no rest for war-weary Americans. But while there is no doubt that Clinton has often supported the use of force, she just as frequently supported diplomacy and negotiations as the nation’s first line of defense. As the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Aaron David Miller noted recently in the Wall Street Journal, Clinton frequently complained about the militarization of US foreign policy when she was secretary of state and touted the virtues of \"smart power\" (the idea that all elements of national power are needed to solve foreign policy problems) and diplomacy in tackling the nation’s most serious national security challenges. Consistent with this approach, she started the secret negotiations with Iran in 2012 that ultimately led to the Iran nuclear deal. She has similarly supported President Obama’s opening to Cuba. She supported and implemented the reset with Russia that began in 2009. When China started becoming aggressive in the South China Sea, she did not reach for military tools, but rather looked to a regional diplomatic approach that stood in stark contrast to Beijing’s military aggression. And indeed, there will arguably be less need and less scope for her to show her military mettle as president than might have been the case a couple of years ago. It should be obvious, to paraphrase Woody Allen’s observation about life, that all the options for the use of force to repair a badly broken Middle East can be divided into the miserable and the horrible. In Syria, the idea of risking US boots on the ground or war with the Russians to support an opposition that consists largely of Islamist extremists is not likely to appeal to her any more than it has to President Obama. For fighting ISIS, Clinton seems comfortable with Obama’s template for the use of military force: the limited use of armed drones, special operations forces, air strikes, and efforts to build local capacity for ground operations and stabilization duties. Clinton has often emphasized that terrorism cannot be fully defeated on the battlefield. To deal with the evolving threat of transnational Islamic extremism, Clinton asserts, the real payoff lies in improved intelligence and law enforcement, greater international cooperation, limiting access to weapons, and efforts to stop radicalization and terrorist recruitment. The most important reason that a President Hillary Clinton is unlikely to have a hawkish foreign policy is that she will no longer be a senator, or the secretary of state, or a presidential candidate. She will be president. And that means that her priorities will be very different. There is an old adage in politics that where you stand depends on where you sit. And from where President Clinton would be sitting in the White House, the world — and more importantly, the domestic political context — will look different than it looked from her perch at the State Department. As secretary of state, her views on matters of war and peace were shaped to some extent by the institutional viewpoint of the State Department. The secretary of state does not need to worry about domestic policy or the president’s public approval rating. As president, though, Clinton will be beholden to the American public and will have many other priorities beyond foreign policy that will occupy her attention. As recent presidents have learned, military intervention abroad can carry a heavy political price at home. Despite the headlines of global disorder, there is no clamor from the American public or the Congress for a more active military policy, except from a handful of charter members of the Washington foreign policy establishment (or, as Obama’s aide Ben Rhodes described it, the \"blob\"). This was broadly seen on the campaign trail in both the Democratic and Republican primaries, when hawkishness emerged as a political liability that both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump profited from. A recent Pew survey, for example, found that 57 percent of Americans surveyed want the US to deal with its own problems, while letting other countries get along as best they can. Only 27 percent of respondents felt that the United States is doing too little to solve world problems. Asserting \"lost\" American leadership through the use of military force in Syria or elsewhere might make the foreign policy establishment and the editorial board of the Washington Post happy. But an overwhelming number of Republicans and Democrats in Congress as well as the general public would sour very quickly on prolonged, open-ended interventions that cost billions of dollars and risk American lives. Clinton has the smarts to understand that she can only fight and win so many political battles as president. Clinton was an accidental secretary of state — she had not focused on foreign policy previously, she did not seek the position, and she did not get the job because of her experience in diplomacy. And while she took to the job with enthusiasm and skill, she has always reserved her greatest passion and vision for domestic issues: health care, family issues, and promoting the rights of women and social justice generally. It is not a coincidence, for example, that of the seven \"biggest accomplishments\" listed on her campaign website, the first six are about health care, family issues, and human rights. (The last one refers to brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.) She wants to make her mark in domestic policy and she will likely reserve her political capital to make the deals and compromises that will be necessary to advance her domestic policy agenda. To do otherwise — to let her and her administration’s time and energy get taken up by unpopular military engagements — would not only break faith with the progressive wing of the party, but could also hurt her standing with the public. Her husband’s administration spent much of its early political capital recovering from the October 1993 \"Black Hawk Down\" disaster, in which 18 US Army Rangers were killed in Somalia. For Hillary Clinton, getting bogged down militarily in Syria at the outset of her administration, for example, could so reduce her political standing and so occupy her time that she would have little room left to implement her domestic agenda. In the end, Clinton as president will likely continue to defy the labels of hawk or dove and continue to annoy advocates of both approaches. She may at times be more tempted than her predecessor to reach into the tool kit and pull out a military instrument to push back on enemies and adversaries. But like her predecessor, she will not risk her political standing unless she is convinced that there is a strong case for how such an intervention will both improve the situation on the ground and meet with the approval of the American public. In the next four years, such cases will be few and far between. Jeremy Shapiro (@JyShapiro) is research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

        "articles": "Take it from me, a New Hampshirite: The current system is horrendously unfair. On Tuesday, New Hampshire voters will exercise their quadrennial right to shape both parties’ presidential contests. The Republican race is set to result in a dull victory for Donald Trump, but whoever wins on the Democratic side, be it Sen. Bernie Sanders, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, will gain momentum going into the rest of the primaries, and improve their odds of victory substantially. I should like this system. I grew up in New Hampshire, and the primary is great. For political dorks, it’s a truly wonderful season (be sure to check out the primary-themed kiosk at the Manchester Airport; last time I checked it had a great Lugar ’96 pin). I got to shake hands with candidates, attend rallies, even ask questions at forums. I carried a Bradley 2000 sign outside a debate when I was 9. Dennis Kucinich was a dick to me once in a diner when I was 13. And when I got old enough to volunteer on campaigns, I got a chance to interact with presidential politics in a way I never could have anywhere else (except Iowa, of course). I seriously doubt I’d be writing about politics for a living if I hadn't spent my childhood in the Granite State. But the system needs to end. There is no good reason why Iowa and New Hampshire should go first. That matters regardless of your broader views on the primary system. I’d personally like both parties to have a national mail-in primary using ranked pairs voting, but even if you think it’s important for a couple of small states to go first, or if you want to do rotating regional primaries, or think states’ voting order should be determined randomly, you should want Iowa and New Hampshire to lose their privileged status. There’s just no justification for it. The United States is a diverse place. Iowa and New Hampshire are not. The US has a large immigrant population, including many naturalized citizens who can and should participate in the primary process. It's a country built on cities and developments proximate to cities; the Census Bureau estimates that 80.7 percent of Americans lived in urban areas in 2010. The census’s definition is kind of broad, but even if you limit yourself to America’s 50 biggest metro areas, more than 167 million people lived in them in 2010 — about 54 percent of Americans. The US is also a racially diverse country, and growing more so. White non-Hispanics account for 63.7 percent of the population. Current projections suggest that America will be majority nonwhite by 2044. Iowa and New Hampshire, however, do not have particularly large immigrant populations. Only 6.2 percent of Iowans and 6 percent of New Hampshirites are foreign-born, compared with 13.5 percent nationwide. Only 7.9 percent of Iowans and 8 percent of New Hampshirites speak a language other than English at home; 21.5 percent of American families do. And a whopping 85.3 percent of Iowans and 90 percent of New Hampshirites are non-Hispanic whites. Only 1.7 percent of New Hampshirites are black. Less than 2 percent. New Hampshire and Iowa are also markedly less urban than the rest of the country; they have cities, but none are particularly big. Des Moines, Iowa’s biggest city, has only 216,853 people; Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest, only has 112,525. By putting Iowa and New Hampshire first, the Democratic and Republican parties are effectively saying that disproportionate power and influence should go to a small group of overwhelmingly white people in rural areas and small cities. That influence shouldn’t go to a state or region with a large Hispanic population. It shouldn’t go to a state or region with a large black population. It shouldn’t go to a state with large cities and a strong interest in urban issues. It should go to these people instead. That does a profound disservice to the millions of Americans living in diverse, densely populated areas. Or, to put it more bluntly, it gives white people outsize power in determining nominees, and disenfranchises black, Hispanic, Asian Americans, and Native Americans relatively speaking. The size of the bias is truly staggering. Economists Brian Knight and Nathan Schiff estimated in 2011 that an Iowa or New Hampshire voter carried the same influence in determining her party’s ultimate nominee as five voters from Super Tuesday states put together. As Ben Adler once asked in the Nation, “How, exactly, is spending the most time kibitzing with a small, racially homogeneous group of people a more important qualification for the presidency than the metrics voters in other states would use to judge the candidates?” Iowa and New Hampshire have plenty of defenders. Their arguments are all bad. The most serious attempt to defend caucuses is the 2010 book Why Iowa? by political scientists David Redlawsk, Caroline Tolbert, and Todd Donovan. They argue that the caucus system creates more informed (albeit fewer) voters, and that the sequential primary system lets candidates be heard and informs voters in later primaries. They put together a good argument, but it’s not an argument for Iowa. It’s an argument for sequential voting. Indeed, the authors conclude with a proposal for a “caucus window,” in which any number of states could hold caucuses, followed by a national primary. “We suggest that the national parties could opt for a process in which any number of states could hold caucuses on the first voting day of the sequence,” they write. “Another alternative would have the parties retaining a sequence in which Iowa, or some other relatively small state, is granted first-in-the-nation priority.” At most, the virtues of caucuses and sequential primaries argue for having one small state go first. But they don’t argue for that state being Iowa or New Hampshire. Many proponents also argue that New Hampshire lets smaller campaigns take off, because it’s less costly to campaign there than nationally, and because they have to deal with voters face to face. “New Hampshire serves as a testing ground for presidential candidates, giving long-shot candidates a chance and making sure that candidates face tough questions from New Hampshire voters who know their issues,” New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley said in 2015. But why does New Hampshire have to be that testing ground? Why can’t it be, say, the Bronx? It has about the same number of people as New Hampshire (roughly 1.4 million). And if we’re worried about underdog candidates not having the money to travel nationally, what better place to hold a primary than a densely populated urban area! Travel between events would be a breeze. And the voters would probably ask better questions. The Bronx is far more racially diverse than New Hampshire, bringing in a whole new array of perspectives, and it has neighborhoods suffering from deep, persistent poverty. In a Bronx primary, campaigns wouldn’t be able to ignore that. They would have to propose solutions to urban poverty, to out-of-control police use of force, to failing schools. My point here isn’t to sing the praises of the Bronx; a Bronx primary would be amazing, but I still prefer a national primary. My point is that every argument for New Hampshire or Iowa is an argument for some other small grouping of people to go first. That grouping of people does not have to be blindingly white and disproportionately rural. It can be the Bronx. It can be Chicago. It can be Atlanta. It can be a portion of Los Angeles. Better yet, it could alternate among a number of areas. The American people want the system to change. A poll last month found that 58 percent of Democratic voters want a nationwide primary, and just 11 percent support the current system; 56 percent say Iowa, New Hampshire, and other early states have too much power. Other polls reach similar conclusions. It’s time the nation’s voters got their wish. This article was originally published in 2016 and has been updated for the 2020 primary.

        "articles": "New York has a single-payer plan, and the numbers add up this time. I hope you aren’t sick of single-payer projections yet. RAND has a fascinating new one, looking at a New York plan for universal coverage. First, the specifics of the New York Health Act: The RAND study’s big-picture findings read like a state-level version of George Mason University’s analysis of Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All bill: But RAND gets a little more granular and helps to answer some of the questions about winners and losers that will likely define the single-payer debate, should we ever have one in Washington. A couple of charts explain as well as I can what single-payer in New York might look like in 2031. As you can see, New York would be spending a modest amount less on health care after 10 years under single-payer than it would under the status quo, according to the RAND projections. $15 billion isn’t really that much in the grand scheme of things, as crazy as that sounds. However, that same spending will cover more people and more services, and more of it will be spent on health care. RAND finds that New York would be spending $23 billion less on administration and $9 billion more on health care services under this single-payer plan. Here’s another good chart: One thing sticks out most to me: New Yorkers would be spending half as much money out of their own pockets when they go to the doctor or get a prescription under single-payer than they would under the current system: $23 billion versus $52 billion. The other thing this chart helpfully illustrates: New tax payments would almost perfectly replace the premiums that people and their employers pay right now for private health insurance. It’s not quite an exact match, but it’s very close: $195 billion for premiums versus $210 billion in new taxes. Then there is the question of who is paying for this new system. RAND’s conclusion is pretty simple: “We find that payments for health care would be more progressive under the NYHA [New York Health Act] than under the status quo.” Basically everyone making under 1,000 percent or less of the federal poverty level — about $120,000 for an individual or $250,000 for a family of four in 2018 — would pay the same or less if you look at everything from their out-of-pocket spending to taxes they pay that fund health care. A family making 139 percent of the poverty level (the Medicaid expansion cutoff) would see their spending drop from $2,700 to $1,300 under single-payer. Families who make 500 percent of the poverty level would have their spending cut from $10,000 to $6,400 on average. Wealthier families might spend a lot more, though. The families making more than 2,000 percent of the poverty level would see their spending (a lot of this is taxes) increase from $141,700 on average in 2022 under the status quo to about $218,000 under the New York Health Act. That is a genuine trade-off. Single-payer proponents’ support turns on the idea that health care is a human right, even for the less fortunate. So this might be a trade-off they are willing to make. In fact, in total, if you look at the RAND research, it outlines what you could imagine as the pillars of the argument for single-payer health care: This comes with caveats, as any projection does. It assumes single-payer would be able to substantially cut payments to providers without reducing access to care. It assumes New York Health won’t cover long-term care, which is very important as our population gets older and very expensive. But I think between the RAND and the George Mason studies this week has shown that there is at least a case to be made for single-payer. The question will be whether its supporters can artfully make it — and whether the people find it persuasive.

        "articles": "The transition period is our last best chance to save the republic The country has entered a dangerous period. The president-elect is the least qualified man to ever hold high office. He also operated the least transparent campaign of the modern era. He gave succor and voice to bigoted elements on a scale not seen in two generations. He openly praised dictators — not as allies but as dictators — and threatened to use the powers of his office to discipline the media. He also has a long history of corrupt behavior, and his business holdings pose staggering conflicts of interest that are exacerbated by his lack of financial disclosure. But while most journalists and members of the opposition party think they understand the threat of Trump-era corruption, they are in fact drastically underestimating it. When we talk about corruption in the modern United States, we have in mind what Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny define as “the sale by government officials of government property for personal gain.” This is the classic worry about campaign contributions or revolving doors — the fear that wealthy interests can give money to public officials and in exchange receive favorable treatment from the political system. But in a classic essay on “The Concept of Systemic Corruption in American History,” the economist John Joseph Wallis reminds us that in the Revolutionary Era and during the founding of the republic, Americans worried about something different. Not the venal corruption we are accustomed to thinking about, but what he calls systemic corruption. He writes that 18th-century thinkers “worried much more that the king and his ministers were manipulating grants of economic privileges to secure political support for a corrupt and unconstitutional usurpation of government powers.” We are used to corruption in which the rich buy political favor. What we need to learn to fear is corruption in which political favor becomes the primary driver of economic success. Many American administrations have featured acts of venal corruption, and Trump’s will likely feature more than most. The larger risk, however, is that Trump’s lack of grounding in ideological principles or party networks will create a systemically corrupt government. Such governments, Wallis writes, “are rent creating, not rent seeking, governments” that operate by “limiting access to markets and resources in order to create rents that bind the interests of the ruling coalition together.” This is how Vladimir Putin governs Russia, and how the Mubarak/Sisi regime rules Egypt. To be a successful businessman in a systemically corrupt regime and to be a close supporter of the regime are one and the same thing. Those who support the regime will receive favorable treatment from regulators, and those who oppose it will not. Because businesses do business with each other, the network becomes self-reinforcing. Regime-friendly banks receive a light regulatory touch while their rivals are crushed. In exchange, they offer friendly lending terms to regime-friendly businesses while choking capital to rivals. Such a system, once in place, is extremely difficult to dislodge precisely because, unlike a fascist or communist regime, it is glued together by no ideology beyond basic human greed, insecurity, and love of family. All is not lost, but the situation is genuinely quite grave. As attention focuses on transition gossip and congressional machinations, it’s important not to let our eyes off the ball. It is entirely possible that eight years from now we’ll be looking at an entrenched kleptocracy preparing to install a chosen successor whose only real mission is to preserve the web of parasitical oligarchy that has replaced the federal government as we know it. One can, of course, always hope that the worst does not come to pass. But hope is not a plan. And while the impulse to “wait and see” what really happens is understandable, the cold, hard reality is that the most crucial decisions will be the early ones. Trump’s first 100 days could also be the last 100 days in which America’s system of republican government can be saved. As Tyler Cowen wrote several months ago, “If there were a President who wished to pursue vendettas, the regulatory state would be the most direct and simplest way for him or her to do so. The usual presumption of ‘innocent until proven guilty’ does not hold in many regulatory matters, nor are there always the usual protections of due process.” And Trump is certainly a vengeful man. As he wrote in his 2007 book, Think Big And Kick Ass, “When someone intentionally harms you or your reputation, how do you react? I strike back, doing the same thing to them only ten times worse.” Trump is not going to crush the free media in one fell swoop. But big corporate media does face enough regulatory matters that even a single exemplary case would suffice to induce large-scale self-censorship. AT&T, for example, is currently seeking permission from antitrust authorities to buy Time Warner — permission that Time Warner executives might plausible fear is contingent on Trump believing that CNN has covered him “fairly.” A Federal Trade Commission investigation charging Amazon with predatory pricing would be viewed favorably by many competing retailers, but would also be seen in other quarters as Trump making good on his promise to punish Jeff Bezos for critical coverage in the Washington Post. Independent media is less vulnerable to this tactic but more vulnerable to financial damage via harassing lawsuits — lawsuits that Trump could mount personally or perhaps have subsidized by his friend Peter Thiel or other big business allies. Even more pointedly, racist and anti-Semitic harassment of journalists by white nationalist Twitter users operating under the banner of Trumpism has already become a daily fact of life. So has “doxxing” — the publication of addresses and phone numbers — of Trump critics. The anti-Semitic propaganda that was mailed to  contributor Lee Drutman also made its way to the homes of several other Jewish  writers, including me, as well as to my upstairs neighbor, also Jewish, who is an editor at a different news organization. The vast majority of these harassers are almost certainly numbskull teenagers, bored office drones, or all-around nutters who would never act on their threats. But it would only take the murder of a single opposition activist or journalist to chill dozens of others. The risk is not that Trump becomes a dictator, but that civil society simply withers and dies. We all like to think we would stand up and do the right thing under difficult circumstances. But to be honest with ourselves, we are all susceptible to the push and pull of fear and greed — especially those of us with spouses and families to think of. A suborned regulatory state could easily quiet mass media criticism, defund opposition activity, and enrich politically friendly actors. The Brookings Institution’s Federica Saini Fasanotti and many other Italian experts have drawn the parallels between Trump and Silvio Berlusconi, who, in the end, wrecked the country. Under his rule, “bad fiscal policy and the absence of (promised, and much-needed) reforms paralyzed the country, leaving it worse off than when he started.” The crucial difference is that Berlusconi’s Italy was a full member of the European Union, with many critical economic policy decisions made in Brussels, its citizens protected by the European Court of Human Rights, and Angela Merkel and the European Central Bank eventually able to bully the Italian parliament into booting him from office. If Merkel could somehow induce Congress to dump Trump in favor of Mike Pence, she almost surely would — but this is the United States of America, and nobody can save us from ourselves. Early media reports on the conflicts of interest inherent in Trump’s dual roles as a business titan and a president are showing a lack of imagination about exactly how bad things can get. Eric Lipton and Susanne Craig of the New York Times, for example, note that President Trump “will oversee the National Labor Relations Board while it decides union disputes involving any of his hotels.” Realistically, Trump and any owner of just about any business could expect anti-union rulings from any Republican president’s NLRB. Besides which, this is just an unusually close loop of an ordinary form of venal corruption — rich business people may use their influence to purchase anti-labor policy concessions from the government. The risk under Trump is of a systemically corrupt NLRB that will selectively not crush unions that have leadership willing to abandon principles and offer political support to Trump. Those that resist will be crushed, but those that collaborate could conceivably share in the money stream that will flow from the government to Trump-controlled enterprises. Right now, Facebook is belatedly taking an interest in the problem of fake news on its platform. But it’s easy to imagine a year from now Mark Zuckerberg realizing that it’s in his interest to ensure that Facebook’s opaque algorithm treats pro-Trump propaganda sites “fairly” in order to ensure that US trade negotiators and financial regulators treat Facebook “fairly.” Rob Pegoraro, reporting for USA Today from a conference for technology startups, writes that “first there was shock” at the election result, and then “the inevitable search for an upside.” It will not take very long for venture capitalists to realize that one good way to maximize the “upside” possibilities for the companies they own in the age of Trump would be to sell an equity share at a discount rate to a partnership controlled by the Trump family. Nobody except Eric, Ivanka, and Don Jr. would need to know that the Trumps are now silent partners in Startup X, Y, or Z. But it would be an easy and relatively cheap way to ensure favorable regulatory treatment. Of course, the loot won’t flow exclusively into the pockets of the Trump family. Everyone will come to understand that you also need to hire a brother or cousin or son of the key regulators themselves to make sure that everyone is taken care of. Back in the 1970s and ’80s when the New York construction industry was mobbed up, Trump did deals with the mafia and understands how it works. Commitment to ideological principles normally serves as a form of restraint on a presidential administration — there are some deals a Barack Obama or George W. Bush simply wouldn’t cut. But Trump has no particular ideological fixed points, and has time and again showed his willingness to be creative and make up new policy positions or rationalizations for old ones on the fly. As Anthony Scaramucci, who got rich peddling terrible investment products with sleazy sales pitches before becoming one of Trump’s biggest fans on Wall Street, wrote at the Financial Times, “Trump is a different type of leader not burdened by rigid ideology.” He will be free to operate in a much more opportunistic manner than recent presidents, rewarding friends and supporters and punishing foes without regard to logic or consistency. Kleptocratic government and autocratic government will serve as mutually reinforcing tendencies — businesses that align with Trump will prosper while those that do not will fail, creating a compromised business-political elite that cannot afford to lose power. It would, obviously, take years to fully suborn the bureaucracy; it is full of career professionals who have their own principles and values. But Trump will have years. Most incumbent presidents are reelected, and a president who’s willing to cast professionalism to the wind and install a partisan Federal Reserve can all but guarantee a temporary economic boom calculated to ensure a second term. Past presidents have been restrained from behaving in such a manner by institutional checks and balances that are eroding under the pressure of rising partisan polarization. But most of all, past presidents have simply been restrained by restraint. By a belief that there are certain things one simply cannot try or do. Yet Trump has repeatedly triumphed in circumstances that most predicted were impossible. As Ezra Klein has written, he operates entirely without shame: It's easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they're exposed as liars, when they're seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested. Trump doesn't. He has the reality television star's ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won't, to say what others can't, to do what others wouldn't. Trump lives by the reality television trope that he's not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they're not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. \"I'm not here to make friends\" is another way of saying, \"I'm not bound by the social conventions of normal people.\" The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind. Trump does not care if normally conservative newspapers’ editorial pages denounce him, if media fact-checkers slam him, if GOP operatives furiously tweet against him, or anything else. He cares about hard, objective obstacles. And that’s where hope lies. Eight years ago, absolutely everyone in Washington thought that Tom Daschle was going to be the next secretary of health and human services. He had close ties to the president-elect via their shared senate chief of staff, Pete Rouse. As a former senator, he was well-regarded on both sides of the aisle. He was knowledgeable about health policy as a senator, and deeply immersed himself in the issue in his post-Senate years, writing a book on health reform. Both progressive groups pushing universal coverage and industry groups anxious about the details knew him and trusted him. But when Daschle turned his tax returns over to the vetting team, a number of problems emerged — most notably that a business associate had loaned him the use of a car and driver that had not been reported as taxable income. After a bit of controversy and criticism from both sides of the aisle, Daschle withdrew his name from consideration. It was a bit of a shame. Kathleen Sebelius, who took the job instead, was a fine HHS secretary. But a former governor of Kansas simply couldn’t play the same role on Capitol Hill that a former Senate majority leader could have. And though Democrats eventually steered the Affordable Care Act into passage, it was a very long, messy process that conceivably could have been improved had a Daschle-like figure been at hand. That said, the principle at work was that members of the Cabinet should be people of high integrity. Daschle forgetting (or “forgetting”) to treat a loaner car from a business partner in the influence-peddling game as taxable income was not the biggest deal in the world. But it was sleazy, and running a low-sleaze administration is a worthy goal. And it’s a goal that senators should insist on in the age of Trump. Between the 48 Democrats and the dozen or so Republicans who said they weren’t going to vote for him, a supermajority of senators are aware that Trump is not an especially trustworthy or high-character individual. More remarkably, one of the senators who did vote for Trump publicly called him a “con man.” Another called him a “pathological liar.” One assumes there are a few more out there who swallowed private doubts in the interest of beating Hillary Clinton. Whatever the precise details, the point is that a critical mass of Republican senators has given us reason to believe that they understand Trump appointees need to be held to an unusually high bar for qualification and integrity — not an unusually low one. Thus far, Trump has hired two people. One, Reince Priebus, is well-liked by Republicans but not really qualified to be chief of staff. The other, Steve Bannon, ran a website that trafficked in racism and anti-Semitism and before that was involved with a sleazy nasal spray business. For his Cabinet and his independent regulatory agencies, Trump should be held to a higher standard than that. Obama’s top-tier Cabinet posts included a secretary of state who ran against him in the primary, a secretary of defense who was a lifelong Republican, and a Treasury secretary who was a largely apolitical technocrat. Attempting to hold Trump to that bar of independence and integrity may sound like a fool’s errand. But it’s of course precisely because Trump does not seem like the kind of high-minded individual who would value independence and integrity in public officials that the Senate must insist on it. Even with an absolutely first-rate group of Senate-confirmable executive branch appointees, the practical problems with having elected a president with no knowledge of or interest in public policy will be considerable. But if Trump is allowed to stack the Cabinet with yes men, cronies, and sycophants, then the danger becomes severe. The main thing that people already tapped for key administration jobs — Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn, Jeff Sessions — have in common is that they backed Trump. We cannot allow personal loyalty to Donald Trump to be the decisive factor in staffing the executive branch. Personnel is policy, and if fealty to Trump determines the personnel, then fealty to Trump will also be the policy. I don’t want to live in a world where personal loyalty to Donald Trump is the sine qua non of every policy decision. And my guess is that if they think about it, neither do Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz or Lisa Murkowski or any number of other Republicans from outside the Trumposphere who will be inevitably ground down if he is able to make his will prevail. Above all, senators from both parties who know in their hearts that we are living through a dangerous moment need to avoid falling prey to wishful thinking. Because Trump is a vengeful and irrational man, picking a fight with him over an SEC commissioner or an assistant attorney general feels unpleasant, and many would simply rather duck the issue. But that vengeful and irrational nature is precisely why the fights must be picked and must be picked now.

        "articles": "Recent reports suggest intriguing possibilities for where the investigation is going. What’s the next shoe that will drop in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation? Mueller’s team won’t say publicly, and they don’t seem to be leaking about it either. But the people they’ve been questioning have been leaking quite a lot to reporters in recent months. And the resulting stories, considered together, suggest several intriguing possibilities for where Mueller is going. Mueller’s investigators have recently asked about hacked and leaked emails from 2016, foreign money trails, the Trump campaign’s digital operation, President Donald Trump’s business dealings in Russia and Michael Cohen’s role in them, secret meetings in the Seychelles, and Jared Kushner’s foreign business dealings. The special counsel is even still investigating Paul Manafort, whom he’s already charged on 23 counts in two different venues. Plus, three former Trump aides have already agreed to plea deals and are cooperating with Mueller, though we haven’t seen the fruits of that cooperation yet. We also recently learned that George Nader, an adviser to the United Arab Emirates’ crown prince, has testified to Mueller’s grand jury in return for immunity. And there’s the forthcoming report on whether President Trump obstructed justice while in office. We don’t yet know whether any of these investigatory trails will lead to charges. It’s entirely possible that many or even most of them won’t. But it seems like a safe bet that some will. So here are the leading possibilities for where Mueller’s going next. 1) The email hacking and leaks: The theft of John Podesta’s, the DNC’s, and other political figures’ (mainly Democrats’) emails is a crime that we know happened in 2016. Mueller has reportedly taken charge of the investigation of this crime. And the Daily Beast recently wrote that investigators have identified a specific Russian intelligence officer behind “Guccifer 2.0,” a leading online persona in the hacks. So charges here seem likely — but of whom? Particular Russians involved with the hacks are one possibility. There’s Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, who posted the DNC and Podesta emails. Then there are the questions of how, exactly, those emails got to Assange, and of whether anyone in Trump’s camp coordinated in the effort. For instance, longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone was in contact with both Guccifer and WikiLeaks. Former campaign aide Sam Nunberg, who was recently called before Mueller’s grand jury, has said, “They want me to testify against Roger. They want me to say that Roger was going around telling people he was colluding with Julian Assange.” Stone has vociferously denied wrongdoing. But it’s safe to say we haven’t heard the last of the email matter. 2) Trump’s business dealings in Russia and other countries: In mid-March, the New York Times reported that Mueller had recently subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents “related to Russia and other topics he is investigating,” in the clearest sign yet that Trump’s business has come under Mueller’s scrutiny. Furthermore, McClatchy reported that Mueller’s investigators “showed up unannounced” at a Trump business associate’s home in early April and questioned him or her about the company’s overseas dealings — with a particular focus on Michael Cohen’s role in those dealings. (This questioning came just days before Cohen’s residence and office were raided in a separate investigation.) Among other things, Cohen was trying to move forward a planned Trump Tower in Moscow while Trump was running for president, and even asked Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson for help. He’s also been involved in exploring previous Trump Organization projects potential in both Georgia and Kazakhstan. (The New Yorker’s Adam Davidson, who has covered Trump’s business extensively, has predicted that investigations of its foreign practices will expose such “criminality” that it will mean the “endgame” of his presidency.) 3) Russian oligarchs’ money flowing into politics: An eyebrow-raising pair of reports from CNN and the New York Times earlier in April revealed that Mueller’s team had questioned at least two Russian oligarchs when they visited the United States — and even seized and searched one’s electronic devices. Per CNN, investigators asked “whether wealthy Russians illegally funneled cash donations directly or indirectly into Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and inauguration.” We’re still lacking details on this, but the line of inquiry could well flow from Rick Gates’s cooperation, since he was involved with Trump’s inaugural fundraising. 4) The Seychelles meetings and Emirati money: Mueller’s Russia investigation took a surprising turn this year with a spate of stories suggesting it was increasingly focused on a different foreign country: the United Arab Emirates. Investigators served George Nader, an adviser to the UAE’s crown prince (the de facto ruler of the country), with a grand jury subpoena when he landed at Dulles airport this January. Nader has since reportedly been granted immunity in return for his cooperation and testimony. According to the New York Times, Mueller’s team has “pressed witnesses for information about any possible attempts by the Emiratis to buy political influence by directing money” to support Trump. Yet there’s a connection to Russia here too. Nader and the UAE crown prince arranged a secret meeting in Seychelles in January 2017, between private security company CEO Erik Prince and Russian fund manager Kirill Dmitriev. Reports have long suggested this meeting was a back-channel way for Trump to communicate with Putin. Prince has denied this, but Nader has reportedly testified that it was. That would raise the questions of just what was discussed there, and why Prince seemed so eager to keep it secret. This Mueller line of inquiry seems to have kicked into high gear at the beginning of this year. That suggests it could be related to Michael Flynn’s cooperation, which began in December; Flynn was, after all, a major player in the Trump transition. 5) The Trump campaign’s digital operation: Given the well-documented Russian digital effort to boost Trump’s chances, there have long been broader questions about whether Trump’s digital operation collaborated in this effort in some way. However, when Mueller charged 13 Russian individuals and three Russian companies with crimes related to a propaganda effort designed to interfere with the 2016 campaign, he did not allege any “witting” participation from Trump’s team. This line of inquiry still appears to be active, though. In March, ABC News reported that Mueller had recently called in “several digital experts who worked in support of Trump’s bid” for closed-door questioning. Mueller also reportedly asked the controversial company Cambridge Analytica to turn over the emails of any of its employees who worked on Trump’s campaign. 6) The Steele dossier’s claims: The major specific claims in Christopher Steele’s infamous document — that Trump is vulnerable to sexual blackmail by the Russian government, that the Trump campaign and Russia conspired about the hacked DNC emails, that Carter Page was involved in collusion, and that Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to meet with Russians about paying hackers — still remain largely uncorroborated and heatedly denied by all parties. But Mueller’s team has, at the very least, been asking about them. At the end of February, CNN reported that they’ve asked witnesses about “the possibility of compromising information that Russians may have or claim to have about Trump,” including about the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. Furthermore, McClatchy recently reported that Mueller “has evidence” that Cohen did in fact travel to Prague. However, Cohen continues to vociferously deny this, and no other media outlet has yet confirmed McClatchy’s report. 7) Other potential charges against Paul Manafort: Mueller has already charged Manafort with a combined 23 counts of conspiracy, money laundering, false statements, tax fraud, bank fraud, and other charges — but he may not be done with the former Trump campaign chair yet. In a recent court filing, Mueller’s team revealed that they had obtained a new search warrant covering five phones associated with Manafort on March 9 of this year. This warrant, they said, was related to “ongoing investigations that are not the subject of either of the current prosecutions involving Manafort.” So Manafort is still under investigation. But for what? One obvious possibility is collusion with Russian officials to interfere with the 2016 election, which is not related to any of the charges against Manafort so far — indeed, Mueller’s team has already confirmed they were investigating Manafort for just that topic. Manafort participated in the infamous Trump Tower meeting with a Russian-tied delegation arranged by Donald Trump Jr., and also tried to communicate with a Russian oligarch during the campaign. Another possibility is further charges related to Manafort’s Ukraine work. Plea deals from his longtime business partner Rick Gates and a lawyer who’d worked with them, Alex van der Zwaan, bring up other topics that aren’t mentioned in the charges against Manafort so far, such as a meeting Manafort held with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) and a report he helped orchestrate that alleged corrupt behavior from a leading opposition politician in Ukraine (which also may implicate the now-defunct lobbying firm the Podesta Group). 8) Jared Kushner’s business and foreign policy (and Russia): There have long been questions about whether presidential son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner has inappropriately mixed the concerns of his family real estate business with his high-level foreign policy job. And in recent months, two reports have claimed Mueller was keenly interested in the same question. “Mueller’s investigators have been asking questions, including during interviews in January and February, about Kushner’s conversations during the transition to shore up financing for 666 Fifth Avenue,” which Kushner Companies owns, CNN reported. And per NBC News, Kushner’s talks with Qatar, Turkey, Russia, China, and the UAE have all been the subject of questioning. Several months back, there were also reports that the FBI was keenly interested in whether Kushner sought a back channel to communicate with the Russian government during the transition. It is unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing that angle. 9) The obstruction report/Trump interview: Last but certainly not least, it’s long been known that Mueller has been investigating whether President Trump obstructed justice while in office — by discouraging an FBI investigation into Michael Flynn, by firing FBI Director James Comey, by pressuring Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself, by dictating a highly misleading story about Don Jr.’s Trump Tower meeting, and by floating pardons for witnesses. Mueller’s team has reportedly suggested to Trump’s legal team that the obstruction probe is nearing an end — and that an interview with the president himself would help bring it to a close. And the Washington Post’s Robert Costa reports that Mueller’s team has suggested they aim to finish a report on the obstruction matter this summer. If that’s accurate, it’s not entirely clear what Mueller would do with that report. It seems that it would be submitted to his boss, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. But it’s unclear whether it would then be sent to Congress (as, depending on the findings, a prelude to potential impeachment), released publicly, or just kept secret. Regardless, it certainly seems that something is coming.

        "articles": "Democrats hoped for a watershed moment. But new polls find few Americans have been swayed on impeachment and Russia. Despite high hopes from congressional Democrats that special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony would clarify the conclusions of the Mueller report for the American public, new polls show the hearings changed few minds about the report’s contents and that a partisan split remains on questions of impeachment and presidential wrongdoing. An ABC News/Ipsos poll found that Mueller’s testimony did little to change voters’ minds on the issue of impeaching Trump. In response to the question, “Did Robert Mueller’s testimony make you more or less likely to support the impeachment of Donald Trump?” 47 percent of Americans said hearing from Mueller made no difference. Although 48 percent of Democrats polled said they were more likely to support impeachment following Mueller’s testimony, just 3 percent of Republicans said the same. The testimony seemed to convince Republicans that grounds for impeachment do not exist; 42 percent of Republicans said Mueller’s words caused them to be less likely to support impeachment than they were ahead of the testimony. Only 8 percent of Democrats shared this view. A majority of Republicans — 54 percent — said the hearings didn’t change their views on impeachment at all, however, as did 44 percent of Democrats. A similar partisan split was found on the issue of foreign election interference. Mueller made it clear during his testimony that Russian interference in elections is a given, saying, “They’re doing it as we sit here, and they expect to do it in the next campaign.” Overall, voters appeared to take that warning seriously: 54 percent said they do not have any confidence in the capability of the US to defend itself against another electoral attack. But, Republicans and Democrats seem to see US election security very differently; 25 percent of Democrats expressed confidence in US electoral integrity versus the 77 percent of Republicans who felt the country is prepared to combat interference attempts. Donald Trump has made it clear he sees Mueller’s report as clearing him of any and all wrongdoing; the phrase “no collusion, no obstruction” has become a mantra for the president and his supporters. The report did not absolve Trump, however. On the issue of obstruction Mueller wrote: “If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.” He did not so state. Democrats hoped to make this clear during the testimony, but a new Morning Consult poll suggests they may not have been successful in doing so. That poll found 35 percent of voters believed the special counsel had exonerated the president while 41 percent believed the opposite. Those numbers broke down starkly along partisan lines, as well, with 58 percent of Republicans believing Mueller exonerated Trump in contrast to the 62 percent of Democrats who believed Trump was not exonerated. Little new information emerged from the hearing, and perhaps because of that, Americans’ initial impressions of the report seem to have stuck. The Morning Consult poll found the majority of voters, 49 percent, first learned about the Mueller Report from Attorney General William Barr’s summary of the report in March. In delivering that summary in a live press conference, Barr said the report proved there had been “no collusion” between Trump and Russia while arguing Trump had not committed obstruction. The polls suggest that for some, and certainly for many Republicans, “no collusion, no obstruction” isn’t just a talking point, but a reality. Following Mueller’s testimony, 100 out of 235 House Democrats said they support impeachment, but party leadership, including Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler and House speaker Nancy Pelosi, has been reluctant to formally begin pursuing impeachment. Instead, they have advocated for continuing to investigate the president. Part of this ambivalence, according to ’s Andrew Prokop, is a question of political strategy: This hair-splitting shows the fundamental dilemma House Democrats are facing on the topic. On one side, the party’s base is demanding impeachment, and many Democrats are desperate to show they’re doing something to stand up to Trump. Some members of Congress may fervently believe it’s the right thing to do, while others may fear primary challenges from the left. But party leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi remain firmly opposed to an impeachment push. Calculating that there’s zero chance the Senate will remove Trump from office, they fear a controversial impeachment vote would harm Democrats representing districts that voted for Trump — something that could put the House majority at risk. Given the general public ambivalence about impeachment suggested by the polls, it’s not clear that, politically at least, Democrats would benefit from beginning that process on the whole. To bridge the gap between members of the base that want impeachment and others who aren’t sure it is necessary, many Democratic lawmakers have been calling their ongoing investigations into Trump an impeachment inquiry of sorts, according to Prokop: Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) mused that, well, maybe there already is an inquiry. “A lot of people believe we’ve been in an impeachment inquiry ever since we started looking into high crimes and misdemeanors,” he said. His point was that there was no official rule for how an impeachment inquiry begins. But his own preferred word choice, he said, is that “we are in an impeachment investigation.” Aside from the politics of impeachment, voters do still have questions about the Trump administration’s ties to Russia. The Morning Consult poll found Democrats may be wise to continue their investigations into the president: Across party lines, 43 percent of registered voters said Russia helped the Trump campaign in 2016, a number up four percentage points since the pollsters asked the same question in February. And a growing number of voters, 49 percent, also said they believe that Trump tried to obstruct Mueller’s investigation. That number was up five points over the same time period.

This week, we felt the moral arc of the universe bending — toward love, toward equality, toward freedom and greater opportunities for all American families,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said in a statement to . \"We have affirmed the right of every American to decent housing, to affordable health coverage, to live free of the old relics of discrimination. Our work is far from over, but this week has been a true triumph for our democracy.\" Together, these changes represent an affirmation in the shift of American attitudes — and of government response to that shift — on a host of domestic issues that divide the Republican Party and imperil its chances of winning the presidency in 2016. At the same time, the Democratic Party has coalesced under a broader umbrella of equality and inclusiveness that covers same-sex marriage, equal access to insurance, fair housing, and fighting discriminatory policies and symbols. This week has shown that will be a boon for Hillary Clinton as she campaigns on those very same themes for the nomination of a party that has seen its divisions on domestic policy dissolve since Clinton's last run, and having a unified party that is more in line with the American public on domestic issues should help her in the general election. The set of issues is particularly problematic for a Republican Party that is still grappling with deep divides between the Tea Party conservative wing that helped fuel the GOP's ascendance in Congress and an establishment wing that understands it will be difficult to win the presidency without following the public's shifts. Take latest decision, a 5-4 ruling preventing states from banning same-sex marriage. Republican presidential candidates are in a bind. Many base voters, particularly those on the religious right, still believe marriage should be between a man and a woman. But national polling shows that a solid majority of Americans support same-sex marriage. In a May Gallup poll, 60 percent of respondents said same-sex marriage should be legal, up from 27 percent in 1996 and 44 percent in 2010. Gallup polling That tension — between the general electorate and Republican primary voters — was evident in the statements put forward by several of the GOP presidential candidates, including field leader Jeb Bush. \"Guided by my faith, I believe in traditional marriage. I believe the Supreme Court should have allowed the states to make this decision. I also believe that we should love our neighbor and respect others, including those making lifetime commitments. In a country as diverse as ours, good people who have opposing views should be able to live side by side. It is now crucial that as a country we protect religious freedom and the right of conscience and also not discriminate.\" Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart, an advocate for marriage equality, said on MSNBC Friday that Bush \"struck the right tone\" in trying to reach out to millennials and others who back same-sex marriage. But it's clear that social conservatives looking to make up ground in the race won't make it easy for Bush and others to blunt the party's longstanding and aggressive opposition to same-sex marriage. Today, 5 unelected judges redefined the foundational unit of society. Now it is the people's turn to speak #Marriage Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is in the top tier of candidates, vowed to his constituents that \"the government will not coerce you to act against your religious beliefs,\" and called for a constitutional amendment to restore the ability of states to ban same-sex marriage. \"The states are the proper place for these decisions to be made, and as we have seen repeatedly over the last few days, we will need a conservative president who will appoint men and women to the Court who will faithfully interpret the Constitution and laws of our land without injecting their own political agendas,\" he said. \"As a result of this decision, the only alternative left for the American people is to support an amendment to the US Constitution to reaffirm the ability of the states to continue to define marriage.\" Henry Waxman, who was a liberal leader in Congress for 40 years, said the GOP should be reeling from this week — noting, in particular, that some GOP officials have been supportive of same-sex marriage and ridding government buildings of the Confederate battle flag. \"The Republican right wing and Tea Party activists suffered three big losses that seemed unimaginable just over a year ago when they realized their goal of winning control of Congress,\" he said. \"Those defeats came about in a short period of time when many of their leaders joined with the overall progressive public opinion on these subjects.\" The conflict for Republicans is obvious, and it follows the thinking Bush once ascribed to himself. The winning GOP candidate will have to be willing to \"lose the primary to win the general.\" And therein lies the rub. Getting to positions that will appeal to general-election voters on same-sex marriage, Obamacare (which most don't want to relitigate) and symbols of prejudice could cost a Republican candidate his or her chance at getting to the general election. Democrats are basking in all of these wins — marriage, housing, Obamacare, and the flag — and it's hard to find a single voice of dissent in the party. Particularly on marriage, there's been a striking geophysical shift in party dynamics. In 2008, Clinton and Obama favored civil unions. By 2012, Obama was running on his backing for same-sex marriage. And by 2013, Clinton had endorsed it, too. There's just no tension in the Democratic Party on an issue that the GOP is struggling with. \"What an extraordinary achievement,\" Obama said at a press conference Friday. \"What a vindication of the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things.\" Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who endorsed same-sex marriage in their 2012 reelection campaign, called Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the case, to offer their congratulations. The frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, announced shortly after she left the Obama administration in 2013 that she is in favor of same-sex marriage — a change from her 2008 position, in which she only backed civil unions. When he was president, her husband, Bill Clinton, signed the Defense of Marriage Act, which allowed states to ban same-sex marriage and the last piece of which was ruled unconstitutional in Friday's decision. \"This ruling is an affirmation of the commitment of couples across the country who love one another,\" Hillary Clinton, who equated LGBTQ rights with human rights in a 2011 speech, said Friday. \"It reflects the will of the vast and growing multitude of Americans who believe that LGBT couples deserve to be recognized under the law and treated equally in the eyes of society. And it represents our country at its best: inclusive, open, and striving toward true equality.\" The one issue that is settled is Obamacare. The court's 6-3 ruling upholding the insurance subsidies at the heart of the law included language that would make it very difficult for a future president to act unilaterally to undo the law. That means it would take a Republican president, a Republican majority in the House, and at least 60 Republican votes in the Senate to overhaul the signature legislative achievement of Obama's presidency. Ironically, Republicans said Thursday, the ruling made life easier for the 2016 GOP presidential contenders and congressional leaders. That's because they can now run against the law in whole rather than trying to figure out how to fix an insurance system they opposed in the first place. The truth is that all of these progressive victories are the result of generations of fighting for equality and justice in various forms, and Democrats were quick to point out Friday that there is much work in front of them. That said, there is a new energy in a progressive movement that feels emboldened by public support for positions that the left has long held — including on same-sex marriage and, especially as the election nears, on economic inequality. The proof of the remaining work was in Obama's itinerary. After speaking in the Rose Garden, he was scheduled to deliver a eulogy for Clementa Pinckney, the South Carolina state senator and minister who was killed in the shooting massacre in Charleston on June 17. The suspect in that case, Dylann Roof, posed for photos with the Confederate flag, apparently wrote a white supremacist manifesto, and is alleged to have shouted racist comments during the shooting spree. Those revelations spurred Haley and some other South Carolina Republicans to join Democrats in calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from its place of honor outside the state Capitol in Columbia. Since then, elected officials in several other Southern states — and in Congress — have begun the push to take the battle flag out of state insignias, license plates, and government buildings. But while the symbol of racism is being lowered, there's no evidence that the Charleston shootings will bring about substantive policy changes on either racial discrimination or the availability of guns — issues of great importance to progressives — in the wake of the Charleston shootings. Roland Martin, the host of NewsOne Now on TV One, noted that the decisions this week came from the judiciary and the state executive branches of government. \"Has the body politic necessarily changed? That to me is going to be the real issue,\" he said. \"The real question for us is still going to be how is public policy affected.\" That's what Clinton has been trying to address on the campaign trail. At a church in Missouri earlier this week, she said that taking down the Confederate flag isn't an answer to racial injustice in and of itself. \"The truth is, equality, opportunity, civil rights in America are still far from where they need to be,\" she said. \"Nearly 6 million young Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 are out of school and out of work. Think of that: neither learning nor working. And the numbers are particularly high for young people of color. Statistics like these are rebukes to the real progress we have made and they pose an urgent call for us to act -- publicly, politically, and personally. We should start by giving all of our children the tools and opportunities to overcome legacies of discrimination, to live up to theirown God-given potentials. While there's been movement on criminal justice reform in Congress — and among the Republican presidential contenders — there's little evidence that Clinton would be able to move the Republican-led Congress on gun control, expanding the government's role in ensuring economic justice, or other major Democratic Party priorities. Jim Manley, a former aide to Harry Reid and the late Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy, said the victories were swift but not necessarily an indication that the country is headed toward a major leftward shift. \"To paraphrase Dr. King, the arc of the moral universe is long, but when it comes to some of the more divisive social issues facing this country, it sure is bending quickly toward justice,\" Manley said. The set of wins shows the government catching up to where the American people have been for some time, he said. \"I don't think these recent events signal that we are heading toward another golden era of progressivism or anything, but it has been fascinating to watch how quickly public attitudes have changed toward such hot-button issues as gay marriage and the proper role of the Confederate flag in this country,\" he said. \"A few years ago, the fight for marriage equality was being touted as the civil rights issue of this era —now that debate is all but over.\" We have a request In moments like this — as people grapple to understand variants and vaccines, and kids head back to school — many outlets take their paywalls down. ’s content is always free, in part because of financial support from our readers.

But if Jeb's not interested in dreary academic controversies, he might want to ask his brother George about this. The economy, you see, grew slower than 4 percent in 2001. It also did so in 2002. And in 2003. And in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. He also might want to phone up his dad, who served four years in the White House and never achieved 4 percent growth. You can also talk about this in job-creation terms, where Jeb's dad is the second-worst president to take office in the past 50 years, surpassed in unimpressiveness only by Jeb's brother.

        "articles": "A niche group of political scientists may have uncovered what's driving Donald Trump's ascent. What they found has implications that go well beyond 2016. The American media, over the past year, has been trying to work out something of a mystery: Why is the Republican electorate supporting a far-right, orange-toned populist with no real political experience, who espouses extreme and often bizarre views? How has Donald Trump, seemingly out of nowhere, suddenly become so popular? What's made Trump's rise even more puzzling is that his support seems to cross demographic lines — education, income, age, even religiosity — that usually demarcate candidates. And whereas most Republican candidates might draw strong support from just one segment of the party base, such as Southern evangelicals or coastal moderates, Trump currently does surprisingly well from the Gulf Coast of Florida to the towns of upstate New York, and he won a resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses. Perhaps strangest of all, it wasn't just Trump but his supporters who seemed to have come out of nowhere, suddenly expressing, in large numbers, ideas far more extreme than anything that has risen to such popularity in recent memory. In South Carolina, a CBS News exit poll found that 75 percent of Republican voters supported banning Muslims from the United States. A PPP poll found that a third of Trump voters support banning gays and lesbians from the country. Twenty percent said Lincoln shouldn't have freed the slaves. Last September, a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst named Matthew MacWilliams realized that his dissertation research might hold the answer to not just one but all three of these mysteries. MacWilliams studies authoritarianism — not actual dictators, but rather a psychological profile of individual voters that is characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders. People who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear. So MacWilliams naturally wondered if authoritarianism might correlate with support for Trump. He polled a large sample of likely voters, looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism. What he found was astonishing: Not only did authoritarianism correlate, but it seemed to predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator. He later repeated the same poll in South Carolina, shortly before the primary there, and found the same results, which he published in : As it turns out, MacWilliams wasn't the only one to have this realization. Miles away, in an office at Vanderbilt University, a professor named Marc Hetherington was having his own aha moment. He realized that he and a fellow political scientist, the University of North Carolina's Jonathan Weiler, had essentially predicted Trump's rise back in 2009, when they discovered something that would turn out to be far more significant than they then realized. That year, Hetherington and Weiler published a book about the effects of authoritarianism on American politics. Through a series of experiments and careful data analysis, they had come to a surprising conclusion: Much of the polarization dividing American politics was fueled not just by gerrymandering or money in politics or the other oft-cited variables, but by an unnoticed but surprisingly large electoral group — authoritarians. Their book concluded that the GOP, by positioning itself as the party of traditional values and law and order, had unknowingly attracted what would turn out to be a vast and previously bipartisan population of Americans with authoritarian tendencies. This trend had been accelerated in recent years by demographic and economic changes such as immigration, which \"activated\" authoritarian tendencies, leading many Americans to seek out a strongman leader who would preserve a status quo they feel is under threat and impose order on a world they perceive as increasingly alien. These Americans with authoritarian views, they found, were sorting into the GOP, driving polarization. But they were also creating a divide within the party, at first latent, between traditional Republican voters and this group whose views were simultaneously less orthodox and, often, more extreme. Over time, Hetherington and Weiler had predicted, that sorting would become more and more pronounced. And so it was all but inevitable that, eventually, authoritarians would gain enough power within the GOP to make themselves heard. At the time, even Hetherington and Weiler did not realize the explosive implications: that their theory, when followed to its natural conclusion, predicted a looming and dramatic transformation of American politics. But looking back now, the ramifications of their research seem disturbingly clear. Authoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate, to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change, and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force. They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things. And the extreme nature of authoritarians' fears, and of their desire to challenge threats with force, would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics — and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable norms. A candidate like Donald Trump. Even Hetherington was shocked to discover quite how right their theory had been. In the early fall of 2015, as Trump's rise baffled most American journalists and political scientists, he called Weiler. He asked, over and over, \"Can you believe this? Can you believe this?\" This winter, I got in touch with Hetherington, MacWilliams, and several other political scientists who study authoritarianism. I wanted to better understand the theory that seemed to have predicted, with such eerie accuracy, Trump's rise. And, like them, I wanted to find out what the rise of authoritarian politics meant for American politics. Was Trump just the start of something bigger? These political scientists were, at that moment, beginning to grapple with the same question. We agreed there was something important happening here — that was just beginning to be understood. Shortly after the Iowa Republican caucus, in which Trump came in a close second,  partnered with the Washington-based media and polling company Morning Consult to test American authoritarians along a range of political and social views — and to test some hypotheses we had developed after speaking with the leading political scientists of the field. What we found is a phenomenon that explains, with remarkable clarity, the rise of Donald Trump — but that is also much larger than him, shedding new light on some of the biggest political stories of the past decade. Trump, it turns out, is just the symptom. The rise of American authoritarianism is transforming the Republican Party and the dynamics of national politics, with profound consequences likely to extend well beyond this election. For years now, before anyone thought a person like Donald Trump could possibly lead a presidential primary, a small but respected niche of academic research has been laboring over a question, part political science and part psychology, that had captivated political scientists since the rise of the Nazis. How do people come to adopt, in such large numbers and so rapidly, extreme political views that seem to coincide with fear of minorities and with the desire for a strongman leader? To answer that question, these theorists study what they call authoritarianism: not the dictators themselves, but rather the psychological profile of people who, under the right conditions, will desire certain kinds of extreme policies and will seek strongman leaders to implement them. After an early period of junk science in the mid-20th century, a more serious group of scholars has addressed this question, specifically studying how it plays out in American politics: researchers like Hetherington and Weiler, Stanley Feldman, Karen Stenner, and Elizabeth Suhay, to name just a few. The field, after a breakthrough in the early 1990s, has come to develop the contours of a grand theory of authoritarianism, culminating quite recently, in 2005, with Stenner's seminal The Authoritarian Dynamic — just in time for that theory to seemingly come true, more rapidly and in greater force than any of them had imagined, in the personage of one Donald Trump and his norm-shattering rise. According to Stenner's theory, there is a certain subset of people who hold latent authoritarian tendencies. These tendencies can be triggered or \"activated\" by the perception of physical threats or by destabilizing social change, leading those individuals to desire policies and leaders that we might more colloquially call authoritarian. It is as if, the NYU professor Jonathan Haidt has written, a button is pushed that says, \"In case of moral threat, lock down the borders, kick out those who are different, and punish those who are morally deviant.\" Authoritarians prioritize social order and hierarchies, which bring a sense of control to a chaotic world. Challenges to that order — diversity, influx of outsiders, breakdown of the old order — are experienced as personally threatening because they risk upending the status quo order they equate with basic security. This is, after all, a time of social change in America. The country is becoming more diverse, which means that many white Americans are confronting race in a way they have never had to before. Those changes have been happening for a long time, but in recent years they have become more visible and harder to ignore. And they are coinciding with economic trends that have squeezed working-class white people. When they face physical threats or threats to the status quo, authoritarians support policies that seem to offer protection against those fears. They favor forceful, decisive action against things they perceive as threats. And they flock to political leaders who they believe will bring this action. If you were to read every word these theorists ever wrote on authoritarians, and then try to design a hypothetical candidate to match their predictions of what would appeal to authoritarian voters, the result would look a lot like Donald Trump. But political scientists say this theory explains much more than just Donald Trump, placing him within larger trends in American politics: polarization, the rightward shift of the Republican Party, and the rise within that party of a dissident faction challenging GOP orthodoxies and upending American politics. More than that, authoritarianism reveals the connections between several seemingly disparate stories about American politics. And it suggest that a combination of demographic, economic, and political forces, by awakening this authoritarian class of voters that has coalesced around Trump, have created what is essentially a new political party within the GOP — a phenomenon that broke into public view with the 2016 election but will persist long after it has ended. This study of authoritarianism began shortly after World War II, as political scientists and psychologists in the US and Europe tried to figure out how the Nazis had managed to win such wide public support for such an extreme and hateful ideology. That was a worthy field of study, but the early work wasn't particularly rigorous by today's standards. The critical theorist Theodor Adorno, for instance, developed what he called the \"F-scale,\" which sought to measure \"fascist\" tendencies. The test wasn't accurate. Sophisticated respondents would quickly discover what the \"right\" answers were and game the test. And there was no proof that the personality type it purportedly measured actually supported fascism. More than that, this early research seemed to assume that a certain subset of people were inherently evil or dangerous — an idea that Hetherington and Weiler say is simplistic and wrong, and that they resist in their work. (They acknowledge the label \"authoritarians\" doesn't do much to dispel this, but their efforts to replace it with a less pejorative-sounding term were unsuccessful.) But the real problem for researchers was that even if there really were such a thing as an authoritarian psychological profile, how do you measure it? How do you interrogate authoritarian tendencies, which can sometimes be latent? How do you get honest answers on questions that can be sensitive and highly politicized? As Hetherington explained to me, \"There are certain things that you just can't ask people directly. You can't ask people, 'Do you not like black people?' You can't ask people if they're bigots.\" For a long time, no one had a solution for this, and the field of study languished. Then in the early 1990s, a political scientist named Stanley Feldman changed everything. Feldman, a professor at SUNY Stonybrook, believed authoritarianism could be an important factor in American politics in ways that had nothing to do with fascism, but that it could only reliably be measured by unlinking it from specific political preferences. He realized that if authoritarianism were a personality profile rather than just a political preference, he could get respondents to reveal these tendencies by asking questions about a topic that seemed much less controversial. He settled on something so banal it seems almost laughable: parenting goals. Feldman developed what has since become widely accepted as the definitive measurement of authoritarianism: four simple questions that appear to ask about parenting but are in fact designed to reveal how highly the respondent values hierarchy, order, and conformity over other values. Feldman's test proved to be very reliable. There was now a way to identify people who fit the authoritarian profile, by prizing order and conformity, for example, and desiring the imposition of those values. In 1992, Feldman convinced the National Election Study, a large survey of American voters conducted in each national election year, to include his four authoritarianism questions. Ever since, political scientists who study authoritarianism have accumulated a wealth of data on who exhibits those tendencies and on how they align with everything from demographic profiles to policy preferences. What they found was impossible to ignore — and is only just beginning to reshape our understanding of the American electorate. In the early 2000s, as researchers began to make use of the NES data to understand how authoritarianism affected US politics, their work revealed three insights that help explain not just the rise of Trump, but seemingly a half-century of American political dynamics. The first was Hetherington and Weiler's insight into partisan polarization. In the 1960s, the Republican Party had reinvented itself as the party of law, order, and traditional values — a position that naturally appealed to order- and tradition-focused authoritarians. Over the decades that followed, authoritarians increasingly gravitated toward the GOP, where their concentration gave them more and more influence over time. The second was Stenner's theory of \"activation.\" In an influential 2005 book called The Authoritarian Dynamic, Stenner argued that many authoritarians might be latent — that they might not necessarily support authoritarian leaders or policies until their authoritarianism had been \"activated.\" This activation could come from feeling threatened by social changes such as evolving social norms or increasing diversity, or any other change that they believe will profoundly alter the social order they want to protect. In response, previously more moderate individuals would come to support leaders and policies we might now call Trump-esque. Other researchers, like Hetherington, take a slightly different view. They believe that authoritarians aren't \"activated\" — they've always held their authoritarian preferences — but that they only come to express those preferences once they feel threatened by social change or some kind of threat from outsiders. But both schools of thought agree on the basic causality of authoritarianism. People do not support extreme policies and strongman leaders just out of an affirmative desire for authoritarianism, but rather as a response to experiencing certain kinds of threats. The third insight came from Hetherington and American University professor Elizabeth Suhay, who found that when non-authoritarians feel sufficiently scared, they also start to behave, politically, like authoritarians. But Hetherington and Suhay found a distinction between physical threats such as terrorism, which could lead non-authoritarians to behave like authoritarians, and more abstract social threats, such as eroding social norms or demographic changes, which do not have that effect. That distinction would turn out to be important, but it also meant that in times when many Americans perceived imminent physical threats, the population of authoritarians could seem to swell rapidly. Together, those three insights added up to one terrifying theory: that if social change and physical threats coincided at the same time, it could awaken a potentially enormous population of American authoritarians, who would demand a strongman leader and the extreme policies necessary, in their view, to meet the rising threats. This theory would seem to predict the rise of an American political constituency that looks an awful lot like the support base that has emerged, seemingly out of nowhere, to propel Donald Trump from sideshow loser of the 2012 GOP primary to runaway frontrunner in 2016. Beyond being almost alarmingly prescient, this theory speaks to an oft-stated concern about Trump: that what's scariest is not the candidate, but rather the extent and fervor of his support. And it raises a question: If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump's ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics? And what effect could it have even after the 2016 race has ended? In early February, shortly after Trump finished second in the Iowa caucus and ended any doubts about his support, I began talking to Feldman, Hetherington, and MacWilliams to try to answer these questions. MacWilliams had already demonstrated a link between authoritarianism and support for Trump. But we wanted to know how else authoritarianism was playing out in American life, from policy positions to party politics to social issues, and what it might mean for America's future. It was time to call Kyle Dropp. Dropp is a political scientist and pollster whom one of my colleagues described as \"the Doogie Howser of polling.\" He does indeed appear jarringly young for a Dartmouth professor. But he is also the co-founder of a media and polling company, Morning Consult, that had worked with  on several other projects. When we approached Morning Consult, Dropp and his colleagues were excited. Dropp was familiar with Hetherington's work and the authoritarianism measure, he said, and was instantly intrigued by how we could test its relevance to the election. Hetherington and the other political scientists were, in turn, eager to more fully explore the theories that had suddenly become much more relevant. We put together five sets of questions. The first set, of course, was the test for authoritarianism that Feldman had developed. This would allow us to measure how authoritarianism coincided or didn't with our other sets of questions. The second set asked standard election-season questions on preferred candidates and party affiliation. The third set tested voters' fears of a series of physical threats, ranging from ISIS and Russia to viruses and car accidents. The fourth set tested policy preferences, in an attempt to see how authoritarianism might lead voters to support particular policies. If the research were right, then we'd expect people who scored highly on authoritarianism to express outsize fear of \"outsider\" threats such as ISIS or foreign governments versus other threats. We also expected that non-authoritarians who expressed high levels of fear would be more likely to support Trump. This would speak to physical fears as triggering a kind of authoritarian upsurge, which would in turn lead to Trump support. The final set of questions was intended to test fear of social change. We asked people to rate a series of social changes — both actual and hypothetical — on a scale of \"very good\" to \"very bad\" for the country. These included same-sex marriage, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and American Muslims building more mosques in US cities. If the theory about social change provoking stress amongst authoritarians turned out to be correct, then authoritarians would be more likely to rate the changes as bad for the country. In the aggregate, we were hoping to do a few things. We wanted to understand who these people are, in simple demographic terms, and to test the basic hypotheses about how authoritarianism, in theory, is supposed to work. We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election: Were they driving certain policy positions, for example? We wanted to better understand the larger forces that had suddenly made authoritarians so numerous and so extreme — was it migration, terrorism, perhaps the decline of working-class whites? And maybe most of all, we wanted to develop some theories about what the rise of American authoritarianism meant for the future of polarization between the parties as well as a Republican Party that had become both more extreme and internally divided. About 10 days later, shortly after Trump won the New Hampshire primary, the poll went into the field. In less than two weeks, we had our results. The first thing that jumped out from the data on authoritarians is just how many there are. Our results found that 44 percent of white respondents nationwide scored as \"high\" or \"very high\" authoritarians, with 19 percent as \"very high.\" That's actually not unusual, and lines up with previous national surveys that found that the authoritarian disposition is far from rare1. 's data analysis only reflects white voters, because the validity of the parenting questions as a measurement of authoritarianism is less clear for nonwhite respondents. However, because Republican primary voters already skew heavily white, limiting our sample in this way is unlikely to reduce the data's validity for the GOP primary race. The key thing to understand is that authoritarianism is often latent; people in this 44 percent only vote or otherwise act as authoritarians once triggered by some perceived threat, physical or social. But that latency is part of how, over the past few decades, authoritarians have quietly become a powerful political constituency without anyone realizing it. Today, according to our survey, authoritarians skew heavily Republican. More than 65 percent of people who scored highest on the authoritarianism questions were GOP voters. More than 55 percent of surveyed Republicans scored as \"high\" or \"very high\" authoritarians. And at the other end of the scale, that pattern reversed. People whose scores were most non-authoritarian — meaning they always chose the non-authoritarian parenting answer — were almost 75 percent Democrats. But this hasn't always been the case. According to Hetherington and Weiler's research, this is not a story about how Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Venus. It's a story of polarization that increased over time. They trace the trend to the 1960s, when the Republican Party shifted electoral strategies to try to win disaffected Southern Democrats, in part by speaking to fears of changing social norms — for example, the racial hierarchies upset by civil rights. The GOP also embraced a \"law and order\" platform with a heavily racial appeal to white voters who were concerned about race riots. This positioned the GOP as the party of traditional values and social structures — a role that it has maintained ever since. That promise to stave off social change and, if necessary, to impose order happened to speak powerfully to voters with authoritarian inclinations. Democrats, by contrast, have positioned themselves as the party of civil rights, equality, and social progress — in other words, as the party of social change, a position that not only fails to attract but actively repels change-averse authoritarians. Over the next several decades, Hetherington explained to me, this led authoritarians to naturally \"sort\" themselves into the Republican Party. That matters, because as more authoritarians sort themselves into the GOP, they have more influence over its policies and candidates. It is not for nothing that our poll found that more than half of the Republican respondents score as authoritarian. Perhaps more importantly, the party has less and less ability to ignore authoritarians' voting preferences — even if those preferences clash with the mainstream party establishment. Based on our data, Morning Consult data scientist Adam Petrihos said that \"among Republicans, very high/high authoritarianism is very predictive of support for Trump.\" Trump has 42 percent support among Republicans but, according to our survey, a full 52 percent support among very high authoritarians. Authoritarianism was the best single predictor of support for Trump, although having a high school education also came close. And as Hetherington noted after reviewing our results, the relationship between authoritarianism and Trump support remained robust, even after controlling for education level and gender. Trump support was much lower among Republicans who scored low on authoritarianism: only 38 percent. But that's still awfully high. So what could explain Trump's support among non-authoritarians? I suspected the answer might lie at least partly in Hetherington and Suhay's research on how fear affects non-authoritarian voters, so I called them to discuss the data. Hetherington crunched some numbers on physical threats and noticed two things. The first was that authoritarians tend to fear very specific kinds of physical threats. Authoritarians, we found in our survey, tend to most fear threats that come from abroad, such as ISIS or Russia or Iran. These are threats, the researchers point out, to which people can put a face; a scary terrorist or an Iranian ayatollah. Non-authoritarians were much less afraid of those threats. For instance, 73 percent of very high-scoring authoritarians believed that terrorist organizations like ISIS posed a \"very high risk\" to them, but only 45 percent of very low-scoring authoritarians did. Domestic threats like car accidents, by contrast, were much less frightening to authoritarians. But Hetherington also noticed something else: A subgroup of non-authoritarians were very afraid of threats like Iran or ISIS. And the more fear of these threats they expressed, the more likely they were to support Trump. This seemed to confirm his and Suhay's theory: that non-authoritarians who are sufficiently frightened of physical threats such as terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians. That's important, because for years now, Republican politicians and Republican-leaning media such as Fox News have been telling viewers nonstop that the world is a terrifying place and that President Obama isn't doing enough to keep Americans safe. There are a variety of political and media incentives for why this happens. But the point is that, as a result, Republican voters have been continually exposed to messages warning of physical dangers. As the perception of physical threat has risen, this fear appears to have led a number of non-authoritarians to vote like authoritarians — to support Trump. An irony of this primary is that the Republican establishment has tried to stop Trump by, among other things, co-opting his message. But when establishment candidates such as Marco Rubio try to match Trump's rhetoric on ISIS or on American Muslims, they may end up deepening the fear that can only lead voters back to Trump. But the research on authoritarianism suggests it's not just physical threats driving all this. There should be another kind of threat — larger, slower, less obvious, but potentially even more powerful — pushing authoritarians to these extremes: the threat of social change. This could come in the form of evolving social norms, such as the erosion of traditional gender roles or evolving standards in how to discuss sexual orientation. It could come in the form of rising diversity, whether that means demographic changes from immigration or merely changes in the colors of the faces on TV. Or it could be any changes, political or economic, that disrupt social hierarchies. What these changes have in common is that, to authoritarians, they threaten to take away the status quo as they know it — familiar, orderly, secure — and replace it with something that feels scary because it is different and destabilizing, but also sometimes because it upends their own place in society. According to the literature, authoritarians will seek, in response, a strong leader who promises to suppress the scary changes, if necessary by force, and to preserve the status quo. This is why, in our survey, we wanted to study the degree to which authoritarians versus non-authoritarians expressed a fear of social change — and whether this, as expected, led them to desire heavy-handed responses. Our results seemed to confirm this: Authoritarians were significantly more likely to rate almost all of the actual and hypothetical social issues we asked about as \"bad\" or \"very bad\" for the country. For instance, our results suggested that an astonishing 44 percent of authoritarians believe same-sex marriage is harmful to the country. Twenty-eight percent rated same-sex marriage as \"very bad\" for America, and another 16 percent said that it’s \"bad.\" Only about 35 percent of high-scoring authoritarians said same-sex marriage was \"good\" or \"very good\" for the country. Tellingly, non-authoritarians' responses skewed in the opposite direction. Non-authoritarians tended to rate same-sex marriage as \"good\" or \"very good\" for the country. The fact that authoritarians and non-authoritarians split over something as seemingly personal and nonthreatening as same-sex marriage is crucial for understanding how authoritarianism can be triggered by even a social change as minor as expanding marriage rights. We also asked respondents to rate whether Muslims building more mosques in American cities was a good thing. This was intended to test respondents' comfort level with sharing their communities with Muslims — an issue that has been particularly contentious this primary election. A whopping 56.5 percent of very high-scoring authoritarians said it was either \"bad\" or \"very bad\" for the country when Muslims built more mosques. Only 14 percent of that group said more mosques would be \"good\" or \"very good.\" The literature on authoritarianism suggests this is not just simple Islamophobia, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon wherein authoritarians feel threatened by people they identify as \"outsiders\" and by the possibility of changes to the status quo makeup of their communities. This would help explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same-sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them. What these seemingly disparate groups have in common is the perceived threat they pose to the status quo order, which authoritarians experience as a threat to themselves. And America is at a point when the status quo s ocial order is changing rapidly; when several social changes are converging. And they are converging especially on working-class white people. It is conventional wisdom to ascribe the rise of first the Tea Party right and now Trump to the notion that working-class white Americans are angry. Indeed they are, but this data helps explain that they are also under certain demographic and economic pressures that, according to this research, are highly likely to trigger authoritarianism — and thus suggests there is something a little more complex going on than simple \"anger\" that helps explain their gravitation toward extreme political responses. Working-class communities have come under tremendous economic strain since the recession. And white people are also facing the loss of the privileged position that they previously were able to take for granted. Whites are now projected to become a minority group over the next few decades, owing to migration and other factors. The president is a black man, and nonwhite faces are growing more common in popular culture. Nonwhite groups are raising increasingly prominent political demands, and often those demands coincide with issues such as policing that also speak to authoritarian concerns. Some of these factors might be considered more or less legitimately threatening than others — the loss of working-class jobs in this country is a real and important issue, no matter how one feels about fading white privilege — but that is not the point. The point, rather, is that the increasingly important political phenomenon we identify as right-wing populism, or white working-class populism, seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed. That is not to dismiss white working-class concerns as invalid because they might be expressed by authoritarians or through authoritarian politics, but rather to better understand why this is happening — and why it's having such a profound and extreme effect on American politics. Most of the other social-threat questions followed a similar pattern1. On its surface, this might seem to suggest that authoritarianism is just a proxy for especially hard-line manifestations of social conservatism. But when examined more carefully, it suggests something more interesting about the nature of social conservatism itself. The exception was a question about affirmative action, which produced little difference between high and low authoritarians — perhaps because it was generally pretty unpopular across all groups. For liberals, it may be easy to conclude that opposition to things like same-sex marriage, immigration, and diversity is rooted in bigotry against those groups — that it's the manifestation of specific homophobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia. But the results of the /Morning Consult poll, along with prior research on authoritarianism, suggests there might be something else going on. There is no particular reason, after all, why parenting goals should coincide with animus against specific groups. We weren't asking questions about whether it was important for children to respect people of different races, but about whether they should respect authority and rules generally. So why do they coincide so heavily? What is most likely, Hetherington suggested, is that authoritarians are much more susceptible to messages that tell them to fear a specific \"other\" — whether or not they have a preexisting animus against that group. Those fears would therefore change over time as events made different groups seem more or less threatening. It all depends, he said, on whether a particular group of people has been made into an outgroup or not — whether they had been identified as a dangerous other. Since September 2001, some media outlets and politicians have painted Muslims as the other and as dangerous to America. Authoritarians, by nature, are more susceptible to these messages, and thus more likely to come to oppose the presence of mosques in their communities. When told to fear a particular outgroup, Hetherington said, \"On average people who score low in authoritarianism will be like, 'I’m not that worried about that,' while people who score high in authoritarianism will be like, 'Oh, my god! I’m worried about that, because the world is a dangerous place.'\" In other words, what might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner's theory of \"activation\": that authoritarians are unusually susceptible to messages about the ways outsiders and social changes threaten America, and so lash out at groups that are identified as objects of concern at that given moment. That's not to say that such an attitude is in some way better than simple racism or xenophobia — it is still dangerous and damaging, especially if it empowers frightening demagogues like Donald Trump. Perhaps more to the point, it helps explain how Trump's supporters have come to so quickly embrace such extreme policies targeting these outgroups: mass deportation of millions of people, a ban on foreign Muslims visiting the US. When you think about those policy preferences as driven by authoritarianism, in which social threats are perceived as especially dangerous and as demanding extreme responses, rather than the sudden emergence of specific bigotries, this starts to make a lot more sense. From our parenting questions, we learned who the GOP authoritarians are. From our questions about threats and social change, we learned what's motivating them. But the final set of questions, on policy preferences, might be the most important of all: So what? What do authoritarians actually want? The responses to our policy questions showed that authoritarians have their own set of policy preferences, distinct from GOP orthodoxy. And those preferences mean that, in real and important ways, authoritarians are their own distinct constituency: effectively a new political party within the GOP. What stands out from the results, Feldman wrote after reviewing our data, is that authoritarians \"are most willing to want to use force, to crack down on immigration, and limit civil liberties.\" This \"action side\" of authoritarianism, he believed, was the key thing that distinguished Trump supporters from supporters of other GOP candidates. \"The willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats — that is most clear among Trump supporters.\" Authoritarians generally and Trump voters specifically, we found, were highly likely to support five policies: What these policies share in common is an outsize fear of threats, physical and social, and, more than that, a desire to meet those threats with severe government action — with policies that are authoritarian not just in style but in actuality. The scale of the desired response is, in some ways, what most distinguishes authoritarians from the rest of the GOP. \"Many Republicans seem to be threatened by terrorism, violence, and cultural diversity, but that's not unique to Trump supporters,\" Feldman told me. \"It seems to be the action side of authoritarianism — the willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats — that is most clear among Trump supporters,\" he added. This helps explain why the GOP has had such a hard time co-opting Trump's supporters, even though those supporters' immediate policy concerns, such as limiting immigration or protecting national security, line up with party orthodoxy. The real divide is over how far to go in responding. And the party establishment is simply unwilling to call for such explicitly authoritarian policies. Just as striking is what was missing from authoritarians' concerns. There was no clear correlation between authoritarianism and support for tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 per year, for example. And the same was true of support for international trade agreements. These are both issues associated with mainstream GOP economic policies. All groups opposed the tax cuts, and support for trade agreements was evenly lukewarm across all degrees of authoritarianism. So there is no real divide on these issues. But there is one more factor that our data couldn't capture but is nevertheless important: Trump's style. Trump's specific policies aren't the thing that most sets him apart from the rest of the field of GOP candidates. Rather, it's his rhetoric and style. The way he reduces everything to black-and-white extremes of strong versus weak, greatest versus worst. His simple, direct promises that he can solve problems that other politicians are too weak to manage. And, perhaps most importantly, his willingness to flout all the conventions of civilized discourse when it comes to the minority groups that authoritarians find so threatening. That's why it's a benefit rather than a liability for Trump when he says Mexicans are rapists or speaks gleefully of massacring Muslims with pig-blood-tainted bullets: He is sending a signal to his authoritarian supporters that he won't let \"political correctness\" hold him back from attacking the outgroups they fear. This, Feldman explained to me, is \"classic authoritarian leadership style: simple, powerful, and punitive.\" To my surprise, the most compelling conclusion to come out of our polling data wasn't about Trump at all. Rather, it was that authoritarians, as a growing presence in the GOP, are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump — and will persist as a force in American politics regardless of the fate of his candidacy. If Trump loses the election, that will not remove the threats and social changes that trigger the \"action side\" of authoritarianism. The authoritarians will still be there. They will still look for candidates who will give them the strong, punitive leadership they desire. And that means Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics, with potentially profound implications for the country. It would also mean more problems for the GOP. This election is already showing that the party establishment abhors Trump and all he stands for — his showy demagoguery, his disregard for core conservative economic values, his divisiveness. But while the party may try to match Trump's authoritarian rhetoric, and its candidates may grudgingly embrace some of his harsher policies toward immigrants or Muslims, in the end a mainstream political party cannot fully commit to extreme authoritarian action the way Trump can. That will be a problem for the party. Just look at where the Tea Party has left the Republican establishment. The Tea Party delivered the House to the GOP in 2010, but ultimately left the party in an unresolved civil war. Tea Party candidates have challenged moderates and centrists, leaving the GOP caucus divided and chaotic. Now a similar divide is playing out at the presidential level, with results that are even more destructive for the Republican Party. Authoritarians may be a slight majority within the GOP, and thus able to force their will within the party, but they are too few and their views too unpopular to win a national election on their own. And so the rise of authoritarianism as a force within American politics means we may now have a de facto three-party system: the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians. And although the latter two groups are presently forced into an awkward coalition, the GOP establishment has demonstrated a complete inability to regain control over the renegade authoritarians, and the authoritarians are actively opposed to the establishment's centrist goals and uninterested in its economic platform. Over time, this will have significant political consequences for the Republican Party. It will become more difficult for Republican candidates to win the presidency because the candidates who can win the nomination by appealing to authoritarian primary voters will struggle to court mainstream voters in the general election. They will have less trouble with local and congressional elections, but that might just mean more legislative gridlock as the GOP caucus struggles to balance the demands of authoritarian and mainstream legislators. The authoritarian base will drag the party further to the right on social issues, and will simultaneously erode support for traditionally conservative economic policies. And in the meantime, the forces activating American authoritarians seem likely to only grow stronger. Norms around gender, sexuality, and race will continue evolving. Movements like Black Lives Matter will continue chipping away at the country's legacy of institutionalized discrimination, pursuing the kind of social change and reordering of society that authoritarians find so threatening. The chaos in the Middle East, which allows groups like ISIS to flourish and sends millions of refugees spilling into other countries, shows no sign of improving. Longer term, if current demographic trends continue, white Americans will cease to be a majority over the coming decades. In the long run, this could mean a GOP that is even more hard-line on immigration and on policing, that is more outspoken about fearing Muslims and other minority groups, but also takes a softer line on traditional party economic issues like tax cuts. It will be a GOP that continues to perform well in congressional and local elections, but whose divisions leave the party caucus divided to the point of barely functioning, and perhaps eventually unable to win the White House. For decades, the Republican Party has been winning over authoritarians by implicitly promising to stand firm against the tide of social change, and to be the party of force and power rather than the party of negotiation and compromise. But now it may be discovering that its strategy has worked too well — and threatens to tear the party apart. Correction: Matthew MacWilliams is a PhD student at UMass Amherst.

        "articles": "There’s an awful lot of loose ends here. Michael Flynn’s resignation — under fire — as national security adviser has the larger question of Donald Trump’s relationship with Russia back in the news. It’s a story that centers on three big, but fundamentally unproven, allegations: that Trump is on the take from Russia, that he is somehow exposed to Russian blackmail material, that his campaign actively collaborated with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign, or some combination of the above. The evidence for those explosive charges is thin. What we have instead are a lot of small, unanswered questions. Questions about Flynn’s behavior and the circumstances of his firing. Questions about the behavior of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and the circumstances of his firing. Questions about enigmatic remarks made by longtime Trump associate and veteran political operative Roger Stone. Questions about an obscure American businessman named Carter Page who maybe — or maybe not — worked for some time with the Trump campaign. But there are also longstanding questions about the opaque financing of the Trump Organization, and about why its founder and owner has been so reluctant to engage in normal levels of financial disclosure. And most of all, there are questions about Trump’s highly unorthodox attitudes toward Russia, its government, and its leader, Vladimir Putin. Here, in convenient list form, are the 30 small questions and three big ones about Donald Trump and Russia. Michael Flynn was a well-regarded, if somewhat unorthodox, Army officer who was promoted to head the Defense Intelligence Agency. There, he clashed with colleagues over disparate visions for the structure of the overall intelligence community and with the Obama White House over Iran policy. He was fired and sent to the fringes of the policy community, from whence he returned with out-of-the-mainstream opinions on Islam and Russia policy, a close association with the Russian television network RT, and an affiliation with Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. A top aide to the president, he was recently fired as part of the fallout of a telephone call with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, during which they discussed the Obama administration’s imposition of sanctions to punish Russia for interfering in the American election. Trump says Flynn was fired due to a loss of trust between the two men, but that Flynn’s underlying conduct in making the call was fine. But: Carter Page was an American businessman of no particular renown who worked in the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch before striking out on his own with a consulting company. Nobody in Washington — and few people in Moscow — seems to have heard of him when Trump started naming him as a member of his then-threadbare national security team. The résumé boost seems to have been a boon to Page’s stature in Russia, where he portrayed himself as a big shot in ways that ended up being a liability to Trump. His association with the Trump team ended rapidly, and Trump has ever since been at pains to minimize the degree of contact he ever had with Page. Roger Stone is a veteran Republican Party political operative dating back to the Nixon administration, when he was a leading perpetrator of “dirty tricks” politics. By the 21st century, he was a marginal figure in national GOP politics but continued to be a player in New York via his connections to former New York state Senate Republican leader Joseph Bruno (who was later convicted on multiple corruption charges that were eventually overturned). He’s also a longtime friend of Trump’s, and a bridge between pre-campaign Trumpworld and the world of politics. His exact role in the evolving Trump campaign is unclear, but he has at various times appeared to be strikingly in the know about the goings-on of WikiLeaks, and anonymously sourced news articles have suggested his ties to Russian government figures are the subject of ongoing investigation. Paul Manafort, like Stone, is an old-line Republican Party operative who’d somewhat fallen out of the national party mainstream. But while Stone became a colorful domestic figure, Manafort sought his fortunes abroad — offering consulting and lobbying services to an array of unsavory foreign governments, and eventually finding work for Ukrainian politician Viktor Yanukovych and his Party of Regions, Moscow’s main vehicle for influence in Ukraine during the 21st-century tug of war for dominance over that country. Donald Trump’s financial disclosure forms reveal essentially nothing about his underlying finances, because all they show is that he is the full or partial owner of a sprawling array of limited liability companies that together comprise the Trump Organization. These are privately held “pass-through” entities, whose profits and losses show up on the individual income taxes of their owners — Trump and his partners. Because Trump has not disclosed his tax returns, this means we have no real idea how his businesses operate or where they get their money. Trump loudly proclaims he has no deals in Russia, but the physical location of deals is not the issue. And Trump has not amassed the kind of sterling record of honesty that should make anyone inclined to simply take his word for it. Before Trump arrived on the scene, the overwhelming consensus in Republican Party politics was that the Obama administration had been too soft on Russia. Republicans believed the New START Treaty made too many concessions to Moscow, that Obama had not intervened forcefully enough against Russia’s allies in the Syrian government, that he had not done enough to back the Ukrainian government, and that he had committed insufficient military resources to the defense of Central Europe. Trump reversed all that. And while seeming very flexible on most policy matters, he has remained quite rigid in his insistence on replacing the GOP’s old “more hawkish on Russia than Obama” stance with a new “more friendly to Russia than Obama” stance. A lot of these details are essentially trivia, but they add up to a few big, explosive questions about why the president of the United States keeps needing to distance himself from his own associates, won’t reveal what’s going on with his money, and insists on advancing an unusual foreign policy doctrine. “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire” is a good dictum for forestry management but doesn’t really apply to politics. Politicians try to avoid embarrassment, and a simple desire to own up to something embarrassing — rather than anything illegal or genuinely nefarious — often lies behind mysterious behavior. It’s entirely possible that Page ended up on the roster of Trump advisers simply because a disorganized campaign was taken in by a grifter. Trump’s refusal to engage in standard financial disclosure certainly seems to be about covering up something, but that something could have nothing to do with Russia. The shifting and inconsistent stories about the Flynn timeline could be nothing more than a disorganized and distrustful White House staff bungling something and then compounding the bungling by not wanting to admit they were bungling. Trump’s boast about meeting with oligarchs could just be a habitually dishonest person lying for no particular reason. But especially in light of Trump’s unorthodox policy views on Russia, the sheer quantity of outstanding questions and loose threads is remarkable. That’s doubly so because the Trump team has repeatedly tried to have it both ways on a number of these fronts — with Stone, Manafort, Page, and Flynn all distanced from Trump once their Russia connections came to light, even as Trump denies there was any underlying wrongdoing and appears not to have fully severed ties. Trump has repeatedly, and increasingly angrily, suggested that the answer to the three big questions is uniformly no. But his inability to provide satisfactory answers to the myriad other questions means it’s hard to take him at his word.

        "articles": "A mix of Trumpian chaos, an impending election, and the holidays give Democrats a shot at securing more Covid-19 relief. In just over three weeks, Donald Trump will no longer be president, but he’s spent his last month in office sowing discord. His latest chaos muppetry — a demand that Congress increase the latest round of stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000 — has now given Democrats a slim chance to deliver more aid to Americans. And, barring that, a chance to make Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s life more difficult. After the House on Monday passed a bill increasing the “economic impact payments” — in other words, stimulus checks — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is continuing the fight. Sanders, with support from the Senate Democratic caucus, plans to use a series of procedural moves to delay a vote on a bipartisan defense authorization bill. These maneuvers can’t prevent the defense bill from becoming law, but that’s not really the point. The bill is considered a must-pass, and Sanders’s objections can delay passage, annoy Senate Republicans, and potentially force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to raise a series of objections that could damage his party’s ability to hold onto its Senate majority. And Sanders also has a clear demand: He will lift his objections to an immediate vote on the defense bill if McConnell permits a vote on legislation providing $2,000 checks to Americans earning less than $75,000 a year. This week on the Senate floor Mitch McConnell wants to vote to override Trump's veto of the $740 billion defense funding bill and then head home for the New Year. I'm going to object until we get a vote on legislation to provide a $2,000 direct payment to the working class. The first round of this fight played out shortly after noon Tuesday on the Senate floor, during an exchange between McConnell, Sanders, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). McConnell sought a vote on the defense bill, and Sanders objected unless the Senate immediately holds an up or down vote on the $2,000 payments. The politics of this fight favor Democrats. A recent Data for Progress poll shows that 78 percent of likely voters support the $2,000 direct payment. Trump himself backs it as well; he continues to tweet his support for $2,000 checks. On Monday, the House voted in favor of $2,000 checks, with 44 Republicans joining nearly every Democrat in favoring the legislation. And all of this is happening as Republicans fight to hold onto two Senate seats in Georgia, a state that recently voted for Democratic President-elect Joe Biden — two seats, it’s worth noting, that will decide who controls the Senate in 2021. If Sanders’s gambit fails, it wouldn’t be the first time that very popular legislation died in Mitch McConnell’s Senate. And McConnell still has ways out; he suggested Tuesday he could tie proposals unfavorable to Democrats to the increased stimulus checks, in order to make the entire proposition more unpalatable. But the strange mix of circumstances that brought us to the point gives Democrats a small chance to make the $2,000 checks a reality. Congress entered the holiday season with three high priority items on its plate. The National Defense Authorization Act is an annual affair that sets much of the nation’s defense policy for the next year, and that instructs the military on how to spend its budget. Legislation funding much of the federal government was also set to expire last Monday, meaning that the unfunded agencies would shut down unless new money was appropriated to keep them open. And then there’s the economic fallout from a pandemic that’s forced much of the country to remain at home, and shuttered countless businesses across the nation. House Democrats passed a $3 trillion package to relieve these financial burdens in May, but the GOP-led Senate dithered on Covid-19 relief for the next several months. Senate Republicans, however, appeared to take a new interest in aid once their Senate majority was endangered by the two Georgia Senate races, which will be decided in a January 5 runoff election. Racing against the end of the year — and the end of the current congressional session on January 3 — Congress managed to pass the NDAA on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, and (after a few delays) a mega government funding and stimulus bill. Georgia Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are both campaigning on their support for Covid-19 relief, and the Senate’s decision to pass $900 billion in relief funding allowed incumbent Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler to take some credit for that bill. But just as everything appeared settled for the year, Trump decided to spend the last couple weeks upping the level of difficulty. The outgoing president vetoed the defense authorization bill, citing his objection to a provision requiring the military to rename facilities named after Confederate traitors, as well as a demand that the bill repeal a quarter-century-old legal provision that makes it possible for websites such as Twitter to exist. He also briefly threatened to veto the Covid-19 relief-government funding bill — though he backed down on that threat and signed the omnibus legislation on Sunday evening. Among other things, Trump claimed that the Covid-19 relief bill should have provided a $2,000 check to low- and middle-income Americans. The bill he signed provides only a $600 check. The punchline is that the Senate needs to return to Washington this week to override Trump’s veto on the defense bill (the House already voted to override Trump’s veto on Monday). And that gives Senate Democrats a brief window to push for the $2,000 checks. Even before Biden’s victory, McConnell resisted many calls for additional Covid-19 relief spending, at times claiming that he was more concerned about the national debt. During the Obama years, McConnell and his fellow congressional Republicans frequently cited deficit fears to push for austerity budgets, although they fell out of love with deficit hawkery almost as soon as a Republican took up residence in the White House. With Biden set to take office next month, Republicans ordinarily could be expected to return to their position under Obama — resisting spending bills that could boost the economy under a Democratic president. But Biden isn’t president yet, and the most immediate electoral concern for Senate Republicans is holding onto the two Georgia seats. Neither Perdue nor Loeffler wants to be on the unpopular side of a fight over the $2,000 checks, and both have come out in support of them — Perdue did so as recently as Tuesday morning. President @realdonaldtrump is right — I support this push for $2,000 in direct relief for the American people.  Perdue and Loeffler’s rhetorical support for the $2,000 checks will mean little to Americans who would benefit from those checks if the Senate never votes to approve them. And the two senators may not gain much political advantage from endorsing more direct relief if their own Senate leader maneuvers to block such a vote — which is where Bernie Sanders comes in. The Senate rules are a maze of dilatory tactics, mandatory waiting periods, and other procedures that allow the minority to put off votes until later. A determined majority leader can still bring bills to the floor, but not before wasting days overcoming these obstacles. Typically, these delays are avoided through unanimous consent. If no senator objects to the majority leader’s request to bypass the many delays permitted by the Senate rules, then the chamber’s business can proceed very quickly. McConnell hoped to have unanimous consent to move to an immediate vote on the defense bill veto override on Tuesday, but Sanders moved to deny McConnell such consent. Without unanimous consent, McConnell will need to use a multi-day process to bring the veto override vote to the floor over Sanders’s objection. Democrats, meanwhile, can spend that time repeatedly seeking a vote on the $2,000 checks — forcing McConnell to either acquiesce in that request or go on record opposing the vote. McConnell could also try to attach a poison pill to legislation providing for $2,000 checks and call a vote on a modified bill that Democrats would find unacceptable, but Sanders and other members of the Democratic caucus could still delay a vote on the defense bill unless Republicans agree to remove the poison pill. Again, acting alone, the Democratic minority cannot force a vote on the $2,000 in direct relief. But they may not have to. The easiest way to get to an immediate vote on the defense bill is to hold an up or down vote on the $2,000 checks, and allow every senator to go on record as for or against them. If the GOP-controlled Senate passed the enhanced Covid-19 relief bill, Perdue and Loeffler may even be able to plausibly claim a share of the credit for its passage. Senate Republicans, in other words, are likely to find themselves torn between a desire to pivot to deficit hawkery in anticipation of Biden’s presidency, and a desire to shore up two vulnerable senators that Republicans need if they hope to maintain a Senate majority. It’s far from certain that the latter desire will be enough to pass the $2,000 in direct payments, but proponents of more Covid-19 relief have a little more reason to be optimistic than they did just a week ago.

Later today in Nevada, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to deliver a speech on the subject of \"Donald Trump and his advisors' embrace of the disturbing 'alt-right' political philosophy\" that she characterizes as \"embracing extremism and presenting a divisive and dystopian view of America which should concern all Americans, regardless of party.\" That's a striking level of prominence for a movement that until recently was extremely obscure. A movement lurking in Reddit and 4chan threads and in community blogs and forums, a movement of right-wingers who openly argue that democracy is a joke. That it's weak, it's corrupt, and it caters to the whims of a fickle electorate rather than the needs of the citizenry. That Congress and the president must be replaced with a CEO-like figure to run the country as it truly should be, without the confused input of the masses. For some in the movement, Donald Trump really is that figure. For the hardcore, even the most authoritarian-styled presidential candidate in decades isn't good enough. Welcome to the alt-right. The label blends together straight-up white supremacists, nationalists who think conservatives have sold out to globalization, and nativists who fear immigration will spur civil disarray. But at its core are the ideas of a movement known as neoreaction, and neoreaction (NRx for short) is a rejection of democracy. Thus, within the world of neoreaction, Trump's seemingly authoritarian impulses are a feature, not a bug. The only real problem is he may not go far enough. NRxer Michael Perilloux, for example, complained that Trump wouldn't pull off the kind of power grab that many of his critics fear him capable of: Is Trump likely to cancel the constitution, declare martial law, declare himself emperor to be succeeded by his children, nationalize the banks and media, hang some of the worst criminal bankers, send the Israelis back to Israel, call the National Guard to roll tanks into Harvard Yard, place all communists and other anti-American elements under house arrest, retire all government employees, replace the USG with the Trump Organization, and begin actually rebuilding America and western civilization? Short of that, he is simply another phenomenon within the arcane workings of the system, as worthy of support as the ebb and flow of the tides. Surely, the unprecedented nature of his campaign warrants excited interest as a historical case-study and promising fore-shock of a true restoration, but he is not the king, and we have a ways to go yet. Others on the alt-right hew closer to Trump, though. The alt-right has become a major base of Trump's online support, causing Trump observers from BuzzFeed to National Review to take notice. They're striking fear into the hearts of the mainstream rightists. \"They are the vehicles by which anti-liberal and dehumanizing sentiments become legitimized in conservative circles,\" Washington Free Beacon editor Matthew Continetti explained in an essay for Commentary. In an essay for the Federalist called \"You Can’t Whitewash the Alt-Right’s Bigotry,\" Cathy Young assails the movement as, \"a mix of old bigotries and new identity and victimhood politics adapted for the straight white male.\" The alt-right is often dismissed as white supremacist Trump supporters with Twitter accounts, and they are certainly that. But spend some time talking to key players and reading the movement's central texts, as I did, and you'll find it's more than a simple rebranding of the white nationalist movement. It's the product of the intersection of a longstanding, long-marginalized part of the conservative movement with both the most high-minded and the basest elements of internet culture. It's a mutated revival of a monster William F. Buckley thought he killed in the early 1990s, given new energy by the web. And it's making its impact felt in a big way this election. In the past, when mainstream conservatives have gone up against racialist, conspiratorial elements on the right, they have emerged the victors. Buckley successively marginalized the John Birch Society in the 1950s, and then Pat Buchanan and his followers in the 1990s. People like Continetti and Young are trying to do the same thing to the alt-right. But with huge amounts of online energy behind the movement, and Trump this year's GOP nominee, it's not clear that the mainstream will win. Let's start with the most theoretically minded, and probably most interesting, branch of the alt-right: the neoreactionaries. In 2007, a writer with the pen name Mencius Moldbug (née Curtis Yarvin) started a blog called Unqualified Reservations. He proceeded to write essays that would inspire a whole movement of online political writers. The neoreactionaries drew inspiration from earlier paleoconservatives like Pat Buchanan and Joseph Sobran but with a tech-y twist. Moldbug, for one, is a veteran Bay Area programmer currently working on a startup he cofounded called Urbit. And the core contention of Moldbug and the other NRx thinkers is one that's been common in technolibertarian circles for a long time: Democracy is a failure. \"Democracy is — as most writers before the 19th century agreed — an ineffective and destructive system of government,\" Moldbug writes. Moldbug doesn't actually like the term \"democracy.\" He prefers \"demotism,\" or rule of the people, a label under which he sweeps modern-day developed democracies like the US or Western Europe but also the former Soviet bloc, Nazism, and fascism. \"Universalist lawful democracy is the least demotist of demotisms, Demotism Lite if you will,\" he writes. \"Compared to Communism and Nazism, there's much to be said for it. But this is a rather low bar.\" The purpose of government, in the view of neoreactionaries, isn't to represent the will of the people. It's to govern well, full stop. \"From the perspective of its subjects, what counts is not who runs the government but what the government does,\" Moldbug explains. \"Good government is effective, lawful government. Bad government is ineffective, lawless government. How anyone reasonable could disagree with these statements is quite beyond me. And yet clearly almost everyone does.\" And democratic government, the neoreactionaries insist, is not effective, lawful government. Because the will of the people is arbitrary and varying, it cannot have the consistency of real, durable law, and it creates incentives for wasteful and, worse still, left-wing government. Moldbug started as an Austrian-school libertarian, and most neoreactionaries have general small-government sympathies and express a fear that democracy inevitably leads to ever greater taxation and redistribution, and otherwise encroaches on individual liberty. \"Democracy and ‘progressive democracy’ are synonymous, and indistinguishable from the expansion of the state,\" Nick Land, the next most influential neoreactionary thinker after Moldbug, writes. \"Since winning elections is overwhelmingly a matter of vote buying, and society’s informational organs (education and media) are no more resistant to bribery than the electorate, a thrifty politician is simply an incompetent politician, and the democratic variant of Darwinism quickly eliminates such misfits from the gene pool.\" The result is a government that grows larger and larger. Moldbug is even blunter: \"Cthulhu may swim slowly. But he only swims left.\" This is a strain of thinking that more mainstream libertarians have expressed in greater and greater numbers of late. In 2007, George Mason economist Bryan Caplan argued in The Myth of the Rational Voter that democracy will inevitably lead to suboptimal economic policy because the general public is systematically biased against markets, increased productivity, and trade with foreigners. Peter Thiel, the libertarian billionaire who co-founded PayPal and Palantir and was the first outsider to invest in Facebook, declared in 2009, \"I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.\" But while mainstream libertarians are outspoken about democracy's deficiencies, they rarely propose an alternative. The neoreactionaries do: monarchy. Well, not monarchy specifically, but some kind of nondemocratic system with rule-driven succession. Moldbug likes to use the term \"formalism,\" or \"neocameralism,\" a reference to \"cameralism,\" the philosophy of government embraced by Frederick the Great of Prussia. Moldbug's vision is corporatist, where instead of a nation belonging to a royal family, it belongs to corporation with shareholders to whom it is accountable. \"To a neocameralist, a state is a business which owns a country,\" he writes. When asked who should lead it, Moldbug's tech roots come through. \"It's easy to say 'put Elon [Musk] in charge, he'll figure it out,' and he might well,\" he tells me via email. Libertarians also tend to be big fans of modernity, and despite its affinities to the tech world, neoreaction really, really is not. Neoreactionaries believe that for a long time — maybe since the French Revolution — things have been going to shit. Moldbug likes to trot out anecdotes about crime in the Victorian era to make his point. Here's a description of 1876 London he cites: There are, of course, in most great cities, some quarters of evil repute in which assault and robbery are now and again committed. … But any man of average stature and strength may wander about on foot and alone, at any hour of the day or the night, through the greatest of all cities and its suburbs, along the high roads, and through unfrequented country lanes, and never have so much as the thought of danger thrust upon him, unless he goes out of his way to court it. The point is clear: Do you feel that safe in 21st-century America? If not, could it be the case that we're regressing as time wears on, and not progressing? \"The present system has every incentive to portray itself as superior to all past systems,\" the neoreactionary Michael Anissimov writes. \"Reactionaries point out this is not the case, and actually see present society in a state of severe decline, pointing to historically high levels of crime, suicide, government and household debt, increasing time preference, and low levels of civic participation and self-reported happiness as a few examples of a current cultural and historical crisis. The demographic crisis in First World countries is cited as another example of decline.\" This countering of the narrative of constant progress also makes it easier for the neoreactionaries to defend actually existing monarchy in the past. Most people living today think of contemporary democratic regimes as clearly better than, say, England as ruled by Elizabeth I. Moldbug believes no such thing: Hitler and Stalin are abortions of the democratic era - cases of what Jacob Talmon called totalitarian democracy. This is easily seen in their unprecedented efforts to control public opinion, through both propaganda and violence. Elizabeth's legitimacy was a function of her identity - it could be removed only by killing her. Her regime was certainly not the stablest government in history, and nor was it entirely free from propaganda, but she had no need to terrorize her subjects into supporting her. If governments really have gotten less free, and life really has gotten worse in recent centuries, then it's a short leap from those conclusions to thinking that democracy is a lie and absolute monarchy has a lot going for it. (Note that these empirical claims are, well, not true. Scott Alexander explains well here; his devil's advocate account of reactionary beliefs is also well worth your time.) The other distinguishing conflict between the neoreactionaries and the libertarians is that neoreaction places huge value on group membership and group loyalty. Most modern libertarians are individualists, motivated by a desire to prevent the masses from oppressing the individual through the mechanism of democratic government. Neoreactionaries are not individualists. They think in terms of social structure and order, and view social classes or races as the units determining the future of society, much as Marxists speak not of individual workers and capitalists but of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie as a whole. They are tribalists, and for the most part — let's not mince words — they are racists. Moldbug in particular views American society as a kind of Indian-style caste system. He views the Democratic Party as a coalition of Brahmins (liberal intellectual types who went to fancy schools), Dalits (poor, mostly black or Latino people), and Helots (Mexican immigrant workers). \"What the Dalit alliance gives progressives is more than just a vote bank,\" he writes. \"What the Dalits are is muscle, a militia, a mob. … Basically, the Brahmins have every possible Machiavellian interest in encouraging an invasion of Third World barbarians. The more, the nastier, the better. Their real hereditary enemy is the native barbarian — the half-civilized Vaisya, the ignorant megachurched Okie redneck, the Huckabee voter, the Bircher and McCarthyite, America Firster and Coolidge voter.\" Moldbug has rejected white nationalism by name (his father is Jewish, for one thing) but only in the course of praising many aspects of it: \"Although I am not a white nationalist, I am not exactly allergic to the stuff … I believe white nationalism is a very ineffective political device for solving the very real problems about which it complains.\" He is sympathetic to arguments for black racial inferiority. \"Ever since Mill wrote his response to Carlyle on The Negro Question and probably well before, writers in the English Protestant tradition have been defending the blatantly theological proposition that 'all men are created equal,'\" he snidely commented on a 2008 blog post. \"In the absence of any evidence for this proposition, one can always assert that evidence for the contrary is unconvincing. Note that exactly the same rhetorical strategy can prove the existence of God, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster for that matter.\" Just as importantly, he and other neoreactionaries insist that contrary perspectives — support for racist governments, opposition to black liberation movements, etc. — are being viciously suppressed by liberal elites in the US: \"even just suggest it,\" Moldbug writes, \"and you'll see what it means to have enemies.\" Neoreactionaries are obsessed with taking down what Moldbug refers to as \"the Cathedral\": a complex of Ivy League universities, the New York Times and other elite media institutions, Hollywood, and more that function to craft and mold public opinion so as to silence opposing viewpoints. Park MacDougald, in an excellent piece on Nick Land's brand of neoreaction, describes the Cathedral as a \"media-academic mind-control apparatus.\" I actually think the best analogy is to the role the patriarchy plays in radical feminist epistemology, or the role of \"ideology\" in Marxism. Neo-reaction demands a total rethinking of the way the world works, and such attempts generally only succeed if they can attack the sources of knowledge in society and offer a theory for why they're systematically fallible. That's how feminist scholars have (I think correctly) undermined pseudoscientific attempts to paint female servility as natural, or male aggression and violence as inevitable and ultimately acceptable. Yes, the argument goes, these ideas have had elite supporters in the past, but those elites were tainted by institutional sexism. Similarly, Marxists are always alert to how media produced by big corporations can be tilted to serve those corporations' class interests. The philosopher Paul Ricoeur once helpfully dubbed this kind of argument the \"hermeneutics of suspicion.\" Neoreaction takes this approach and flips it on its head. No, it's not institutional sexism or bourgeois class interest that's perverting our knowledge base. It's institutional progressivism, and fear of the revival of monarchism, tribalism, and prejudice. That makes it a lot easier for neoreactionaries to defend their narrative of Western decline and democratic failure. If you look at the numbers, the Whig theory of history — with some faults and starts, everything's getting better — appears to be basically right. Extreme poverty is at historic lows, hunger and infant mortality are plummeting, life expectancy is going up, war is on the decline, education is more available, homicide rates are down, etc. But what if those numbers are all lies produced by biased Cathedral sources in academia and propagated by Cathedral tools in the media like ? What then? The neoreactionaries are a distinctly '00s and '10s phenomenon, but they draw on the racialist and traditionalist arguments of a much older movement: paleoconservatism. The term \"paleoconservatism\" is a retronym coined in the 1980s to characterize a brand of conservatism that was by then going extinct, a brand exemplified by Robert Taft, the Ohio senator and legendary isolationist who lost the 1952 Republican nomination to Dwight Eisenhower, and by Pat Buchanan in his 1992, 1996, and 2000 presidential runs. Paleocons agree with mainstream conservatism on social issues — they tend to be stridently anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ rights, pro-school prayer, and disproportionately traditionalist Catholic — and on the evils of the welfare state, but part ways on international affairs, including immigration, trade, and warfare. Paleocons are largely isolationist, warning America against foreign entanglements and dismissing neocon attempts at democracy promotion as hubristic and doomed to failure. They were overwhelmingly against the Iraq War, and tend to be heavily critical of Israel. They're also more fervently nationalist than mainstream Republicans. That translates into a very negative view of immigration, both due to its perceived economic harm to Americans and because of the \"damage\" it does to American culture, and into more support for tariffs and trade protection. But since Buchanan, the movement hasn't had a loud national voice. After 9/11, paleocon isolationism became anathema among conservative intellectuals and politicians. Mainstream conservatives like George W. Bush and Marco Rubio embraced immigration reform that offered unauthorized immigrants citizenship. Free trade opposition within the GOP went extinct. There are a number of reasons the paleocons lost ground, but a big one was that the movement had a huge racism problem. In particular, skepticism of foreign entanglements and of the alliance with Israel specifically would occasionally bleed into overt anti-Semitism. The saga of Joseph Sobran is a case in point. A longtime columnist at National Review, he was fired by William F. Buckley in 1993 following years of open clashes about his attitude toward Israel and Jewish people in general. In 1991, Buckley had dedicated an entire issue of the magazine to a 40,000-word essay he wrote, \"In Search of Anti-Semitism,\" in which he condemned Buchanan (then challenging President George H.W. Bush in the GOP primaries) and his employee Sobran for anti-Jewish prejudice. Buckley had a point. Sobran really was a world-class anti-Semite, writing in one National Review column , \"If Christians were sometimes hostile to Jews, that worked two ways. Some rabbinical authorities held that it was permissible to cheat and even kill Gentiles.\" After leaving NR, Sobran's writing, in the words of fellow paleocon and American Conservative editor Scott McConnell, \"deteriorated into the indefensible.\" He started speaking at conferences organized by famed Holocaust denier David Irving and the denial group Institute for Historical Review, asking at the latter, \"Why on earth is it 'anti-Jewish' to conclude from the evidence that the standard numbers of Jews murdered are inaccurate, or that the Hitler regime, bad as it was in many ways, was not, in fact, intent on racial extermination?\" He wasn't alone. John Derbyshire, perhaps the last real paleocon left at National Review, was canned in 2012 after writing a piece addressed to children full of advice like, \"Avoid concentrations of blacks not all known to you personally,\" \"Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods,\" and, \"If planning a trip to a beach or amusement park at some date, find out whether it is likely to be swamped with blacks on that date.\" After that, Derbyshire started writing at VDARE, an anti-immigration white nationalist site named after Virginia Dare, the first white Christian born in British North America. The article that got him fired wasn't actually posted at National Review but at Taki's Magazine, an outlet run by millionaire paleocon Taki Theodoracopulos that was formerly edited by outspoken white supremacist Richard B. Spencer and has run articles by Theodoracopulos in support of the Greek neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn. This has been the trend for paleoconservative writing in the past decade or two. It's largely turned from mainstream conservative outfits to openly racist venues like VDARE, Taki's, American Renaissance, and the Occidental Observer. Admirably, the American Conservative has held the line and resisted crossing over into open white nationalism, but they're basically alone in that. Meanwhile, Pat Buchanan, the paleocons' great political hope, has more or less always been this openly bigoted. In 1990 he infamously insisted that 850,000 Jews couldn't have died at Treblinka from diesel fumes. In 2007 he declared, \"If you want to know ethnicity and power in the United States Senate, 13 members of the Senate are Jewish folks who are from 2 percent of the population. That is where real power is at.\" In 2008, he wrote an entire book arguing that the Second World War was basically Britain's fault and Hitler was largely blameless. So it's no surprise that he, too, has been increasingly marginalized, losing his MSNBC position in 2012. The neoreactionaries are not simply heirs to the paleoconservatives. The paleocons are ultimately more religious, and more loyal to the US Constitution and basic small-r republican ideals. But the neoreactionaries share with the paleocons a belief in tribalism and racial difference, and a deep sense that the mainstream is trying to crush them. Joseph Sobran didn't use the term \"Cathedral,\" but he'd surely think it to blame for his marginalization. The leading actual neoreactionaries are not fans of Donald Trump. \"Trump appears to have no ideology at all and very little historical/intellectual awareness of his context,\" Moldbug — who now just goes by his birth name, Curtis Yarvin — writes in an email. \"I would love to see a CEO with a real track record of strategic execution in a large enterprise — an Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos — running against Trump. I don't even think the ideology matters that much; once someone competent got in that office, and felt a real sense of both authority and responsibility, ideology would start to matter a lot less.\" Instead, the alt-right's affiliation with Trump comes from another group that blended paleocon-ish ideas with internet culture. I speak, of course, of 4chan. 4chan is mostly still a forum for trolling and random nonsense. It was started to discuss anime, and insofar as it's been political it's been in a not strictly left-right way, and usually through the avenue of Anonymous, the activist group that split off from 4chan to do direct action. Protesting Scientology and leaking information on the Steubenville rapists are definitely political acts, but they're not identifiably left-wing or right-wing. But in recent years, a vocal right-wing contingent has popped up. As New York magazine's Brian Feldman explains, part of this is an artifact of 4chan gaining popularity and its popular catchall board — /b/ — losing ground to alternatives, notably /pol/, or the \"Politically Incorrect\" chat board. \"To the extent that there is a shared political ideology across /pol/, it’s a heavily ironic mix of garden-variety white supremacy and neo-reactionary movements,\" Feldman writes. \"Most days,\" the Daily Beast's Jacob Siegel writes, \"/pol/ resembles nothing so much as [white supremacist blog] The Daily Stormer with the signal to noise dial turned only slightly.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center has taken notice, with fellow Keegan Hankes telling Siegel, \"You can’t understate 4chan’s role. I constantly see 4chan being mentioned by the more Internet- and tech-savvy guys in the white nationalist movement. They’re getting their content from 4chan.\" Hankes has noticed this trend on Reddit as well, noting in a Gawker essay that \"Reddit increasingly is providing a home for anti-black racists — and some of the most virulent and violent propaganda around.\" This has channeled into the Trump movement. Milo Yiannopoulos, the Breitbart writer and major Trump defender who's perhaps the most vocal exponent of alt-rightism online, famously employs an army of interns, a lot of whom he says are \"young 4chan guys.\" In their own alt-right explainer, Yiannopoulos and co-author Allum Bokhari argue that /pol/'s alt-righters have embraced racism purely for shock value: Just as the kids of the 60s shocked their parents with promiscuity, long hair and rock’n’roll, so too do the alt-right’s young meme brigades shock older generations with outrageous caricatures, from the Jewish \"Shlomo Shekelburg\" to \"Remove Kebab,\" an internet in-joke about the Bosnian genocide. Are they actually bigots? No more than death metal devotees in the 80s were actually Satanists. For them, it’s simply a means to fluster their grandparents … Young people perhaps aren’t primarily attracted to the alt-right because they’re instinctively drawn to its ideology: they’re drawn to it because it seems fresh, daring and funny, while the doctrines of their parents and grandparents seem unexciting, overly-controlling and overly-serious. For good measure, they quote Moldbug/Yarvin: \"If you spend 75 years building a pseudo-religion around anything – an ethnic group, a plaster saint, sexual chastity or the Flying Spaghetti Monster – don’t be surprised when clever 19-year-olds discover that insulting it is now the funniest fucking thing in the world. Because it is.\" This branch of the alt-right has also played an important role in the Gamergate movement, an ongoing effort to harass women in the video game industry until they shut up about equality and representation. Yiannopoulos, who before the controversy called gamers \"pungent beta male bollock-scratchers and twelve-year-olds,\" jumped on it as a cause with reactionary potential. \"GamerGate is remarkable — and attracts the interest of people like me — because it represents perhaps the first time in the last decade or more that a significant incursion has been made in the culture wars against guilt-mongerers, nannies, authoritarians and far-Left agitators,\" he wrote in late 2014. The affinity between gamers and right politics makes sense. \"It’s not hard to see why this ideology would catch-on with white male geeks,\" Klint Finley writes in his excellent explainer on neoreaction. \"It tells them that they are the natural rulers of the world, but that they are simultaneously being oppressed by a secret religious order. And the more media attention is paid to workplace inequality, gentrification and the wealth gap, the more their bias is confirmed.\" \"While GamerGate started off as a very diverse, vocal opponent to what they saw was unethical journalism (before it was debunked), many of the anonymous /pol/ rightists would take advantage of its anti-left character by creating sock-puppets,\" an anonymous 4channer and ex-Gamergater wrote last year. \"Today it is hard to find a 4chan user that doesn’t have an attachment to far right politics.\" And this enthusiasm for far-right politics has bled into Trumpism. JaredTSwift, an alt-righter who got his start on 4chan, gushed to Motherboard's Oliver Lee, \"Trump was meme-able and entertaining, and something like a ban on Muslim immigration would never have been considered before him.\" r/The_Donald — the alt-right dominated home of Trump supporters on Reddit — racked up 52 million pageviews in March, way more than the 35 million at r/SandersForPresident. The driving force behind the subreddit is CisWhiteMaelstrom, a user whose very name includes the kind of purposefully offensive trolling that defines the Channer alt-right. \"Clicking through r/The_Donald is like walking into a rowdy clubhouse for (mostly) men who feel under siege from 'political correctness,'\" MSNBC's Benjy Sarlin reports. Scrolling through the Reddit page, one sees reference after reference to \"cuckservatives,\" an alt-right term of art which analogizes mainstream conservatives to cuckolded husbands. While the alt-right constitutes a big share of Trump's online support — if you've ever criticized Trump on Twitter, you've probably dealt with alt-rightists — the internet is not the real world. They're not a necessary part of Trump's electoral coalition. They're not organized enough to make policy demands of a policy administration, and too disillusioned by mainstream politics to make such demands in any case. Insofar as the alt-right's role in the Trump movement matters, it matters because it suggests a route for Trumpism to survive past Trump. If the polls are right, Trump is set to go down in fiery defeat in November, crushed by Hillary Clinton. But win or lose, Trump has shown that overt contempt for racial equality, naked tribalistic appeals to white racial solidarity, and vaguely authoritarian rhetoric can add up to a very successful campaign, at least within the Republican Party. That gives the alt-right new relevance, and helps convince its members that America might be ready for their ideas. It also opens the door for a more sophisticated future candidate, one reared on alt-right arguments rather than stumbling into them the way Trump has. Such a candidate could effectively whip up an alt-right base of support, but potentially use it more intelligently and effectively than Trump. If this sounds fantastical, it's worth remembering that open white supremacists like Strom Thurmond and James Eastland were serving in the US Senate 40, 30, even 20 years ago. Our current period without avowed white nationalists in power, backed by an organized constituency of the same, is the exception, not the norm. \"Trump is a flashlight. Trump shines a light on forgotten truths,\" the neoreactionary Ryan Landry writes. \"Trump shines a light on the fact that we truly have reached a point where a candidate who implicitly advocates for whites is considered dangerous and a cause for protest. … Those on the edge have known this anti-white mania is out there, but the protest-riot made it real for millions more.\" That's exactly it. Neoreaction is on the edge, as is the alt-right as a whole, but Trump is not. Trump is decidedly mainstream. He's scaring mainstream conservative outlets like National Review and Commentary. And like Gamergate before him, he suggests that the ideas of neoreaction and alt-rightism could break through, and that candidates supported by alt-right elements have a bright future ahead of them.

        "articles": "“It’s every bit as dire, but just a little more complicated to explain.” Progressive Democratic activist groups have been strategizing their plan of attack on a Republican tax bill for months. Now they’ve been given extra ammunition. Competing demands have led Senate Republicans to include a provision that would repeal the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which would save $300 billion over 10 years but also result in 13 million people losing their health insurance. Messaging around the abstract, complicated details of tax reform has proved challenging. But with the health care fight suddenly back again, activists are hoping to replicate the success they achieved earlier this summer as they helped defeat Obamacare repeal. “We’re back where we were earlier this year with the health care bill,” said Angel Padilla, policy director for Indivisible, a national activist group. “We have to kill it in the Senate.” The stakes are high — the tax bill is unpopular, and if progressive activists can put enough pressure on senators to kill this one too, then Republicans will start 2018 without a major piece of legislation passed despite controlling all branches of government. The playbook activists are deploying is similar; with groups targeting key senators they hope to get to a no vote, including Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Susan Collins, (R-ME) and John McCain (R-AZ). Activists were on the front lines during the Obamacare repeal effort, holding sit-ins in House and Senate offices on Capitol Hill and across the country, and jamming the phone lines, encouraging senators to vote no. After winning, many of these same progressive organizations, including Indivisible, MoveOn, and coalitions like Not One Penny and Americans for Tax Fairness, immediately turned their attention to tax reform — the next big item on Republicans’ policy agenda. “As soon as health care was behind us, we were working with our groups to make sure they were pressuring on taxes,” said Padilla. Across the country, Americans have been mobilizing across the country for days of action, calling their representatives and senators. But it hasn’t been easy. With health care, the stakes were much clearer. The tax bill has “been much more of a challenge,” said TJ Helmstetter, spokesperson for advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness. “Because health care took so much of the year, and rightfully took up so much oxygen, it's been harder to get people focused.” During the health care debate, activist groups could point to clear numbers of people who would lose health insurance if Obamacare was repealed. In that respect, Senate Republicans adding the individual mandate to their tax bill has certainly helped focus people’s attention. “For this, it’s every bit as dire, but just a little more complicated to explain,” Helmstetter said. Progressive groups are also being outspent by pro-tax cut groups with deep pockets, including the US Chamber of Commerce and the billionaire Koch brothers, Helmstetter added. The lack of attention also has to do with the incredibly fast pace that Republicans are moving on taxes in both the House and Senate. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia underscored that last week, as the Senate Finance Committee recently approved the tax bill in a late-night session. It's 11:21pm. Most Americans are asleep. But the GOP members of the Senate Finance Committee just rammed through their tax bill on a partisan vote, under cover of darkness. This process is an embarrassment. The big thing that progressive groups have on their side now is the unpopularity of the House and Senate tax plans, and the fact that they give advantages to corporations over the middle class. A recent poll from Quinnipiac found that most Americans don’t like the House and Senate proposals. Outside analyses have estimated that more than 25 percent of taxpayers would pay more by 2027 under the House bill, while the Senate bill is projected to raise taxes on poorer Americans who make less than $30,000 a year starting in 2021. And Democrats are sounding the alarm about the tax plan triggering massive cuts to entitlement programs, after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the tax plans could trigger a $25 billion cut to Medicare. “This is like a one-two punch, and the best way to stop the second punch is to stop the first one,” said Ben Wikler, Washington director of MoveOn.org, one of the left’s biggest advocacy groups. As dramatic as those projections are, it’s given Democratic activists groups a clear message to rally around: Republicans want to cut taxes for the rich, and they’re going to do that by raising taxes on the poor (and gut health care coverage along the way). There’s plenty of independent analysis to support this. A recent Tax Policy Center estimate found that the individual tax cuts in the House plan would overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent 10 years from now. At the same time, millions of US households of middle- and working-class families would eventually see their taxes raised, according to analysis from the New York Times. “It’s like they are trying to make this bill as bad as possible, and that reminds me of the track we were on with health care,” said Tim Hogan, spokesperson for Not One Penny, a coalition of progressive groups fighting against the tax bills. Activist groups say they’re somewhat surprised with how brazen some Republicans have been about revealing the reasons they are supporting the bill. For instance, earlier this month, Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) told reporters, “My donors are basically saying, ‘Get it done or don’t ever call me again.’” Congressional Democrats and activist groups have jumped on Collins’s line, saying it shows that Republicans aren’t even trying to hide the intent of their bill. “Republicans are talking to rich Republican donors more than they’re talking to their constituents,” Wikler said. “You’d think they’d look out the window and notice the people chanting outside.” Earlier this year, there was some fear among progressive groups that Senate Democrats from pro-Trump states would feel the pressure to support a Republican tax bill, as Jeff Stein wrote for . But that fear has since been alleviated; progressive groups say they’re feeling confident that more conservative Democratic senators won’t support the current tax bill, leaving them free to focus on convincing Republicans. But they’re also looking toward Democratic senators to get a lot more antagonistic and even potentially hold up Senate process, depending on how far the bill gets. Progressive groups ran into a problem with a slow-down in media attention to their cause during the health care bill as well, in large part due to a chaotic news cycle dominated by President Donald Trump. Much like that time, the news cycle is dominated by chaotic stories, like the sexual assault allegations against Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, and now the Democrats’ own Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota. That makes it tough to get the same level of coverage on the tax bill — much less tax activism. “There’s been such a blizzard of news, a lot of Washington hasn’t realized the intensity of activism against the tax bill yet,” Wikler said. That’s where Senate Democrats could come in. As the health care bill was speeding its way through the Senate without hearings or CBO analysis, Democrats made a huge stink about it. In the middle of June, Democrats announced that they essentially were holding Senate process hostage; withholding consent on legislative business and therefore shutting down the normal operations of the Senate. They also started invoking something known as the two-hour rule, which cut short the time Senate Republican committees had for their hearings. “All of that helped focus the attention where it needed to be,” Padilla said. Now, with taxes, he’s hoping Democrats will get off the sidelines. “We don’t want them to watch this play out.” We have a request In moments like this — as people grapple to understand variants and vaccines, and kids head back to school — many outlets take their paywalls down. ’s content is always free, in part because of financial support from our readers.

        "articles": "Even those most invested in the Court’s grandeur are finding it hard to defend its reality. Tonight, at 9 pm Eastern, President Donald Trump will announce his pick to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Will it be Brett Kavanaugh, beloved by establishment Republicans for his rulings against the Affordable Care Act? Amy Coney Barrett, whose Catholic faith and uncompromising social conservatism have made her a favorite among Christian conservatives? Raymond Kethledge, an outdoorsman who managed to charm Trump in his interview? Which judge Trump chooses is less meaningful than the fact that Trump is choosing a second justice at all. The first seat Trump filled opened under Barack Obama, but Senate Republicans refused to consider any replacements, hoping to win the 2016 election and see the seat filled by a Republican. Mitch McConnell’s bet paid off: Trump did win that election, though he lost the popular vote decisively, and Neil Gorsuch was named to the Court. Such appointments are becoming the norm. With Kennedy’s replacement, four out of the Supreme Court’s nine justices — all of whom have lifetime tenure — will have been nominated by presidents who won the White House, at least initially, despite losing the popular vote. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with that. America, for all its proud democratic rhetoric, is not actually a democracy. Until and unless the country chooses to abolish the Electoral College, it will remain not-quite-a-democracy, with all the strange outcomes that entails. Liberals may complain, but the rules are the rules, and both sides know what they are. But the Supreme Court’s conservative bloc doesn’t just reflect the outcomes of America’s undemocratic electoral rules; it is writing and, in some cases, rewriting them, to favor the Republican Party — making it easier to suppress votes, simpler for corporations and billionaires to buy elections, and legal for incumbents to gerrymander districts to protect and enhance their majorities. The Supreme Court has always been undemocratic. What it’s becoming is something more dangerous: anti-democratic. Dahlia Lithwick, Slate’s legal analyst, has been covering the Supreme Court for 20 years. She’s the smartest and most humane Court-watcher I know. And she sounds depressed. “This was the worst year I can remember for voting rights,” she told me. “Folks who are going to go to the polls in 2020 and 2022 and going forward will have even less political power than they had. This conservative, five-justice bloc is distorting electoral politics to make it even harder to be represented.” (You can hear our whole conversation here, or by subscribing to my podcast.) What we’re seeing here is an alliance, not a coincidence. Republicans won the White House and the Senate, used that power to appoint judges to the Supreme Court, and the judges they vetted and elevated are making it easier for their patrons to retain power in the future. Yes, that’s a grim, cynical analysis. But is it wrong? Consider some of the decisions the Court made just this term: In a 5-4, party-line opinion, the Court upheld Ohio’s voter purge, which controversially strikes voters from the rolls if they don’t vote for two years and then fail to respond to a mailed questionnaire or vote in another election for four years. Though the policy was tied up in legal battles during the 2016 election, in 2012, 1.5 million Ohioans were mailed the questionnaires that could lead to them being purged, and more than 1 million failed to respond. To put that in perspective, Trump’s 2016 margin in Ohio was 446,841 votes, and Obama’s 2012 margin was merely 166,214 votes. (The Court’s endorsement of Ohio’s law is expected to reverberate far beyond the Buckeye State. “At least a dozen other politically conservative states said they would adopt a similar practice if Ohio prevailed,” NBC News reported.) In another 5-4 case, the Court largely refused to strike down a series of racial gerrymanders in Texas that a San Antonio district court said denied Latinos “their opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent was blistering. “This disregard of both precedent and fact comes at serious costs to our democracy,” she wrote. “It means that, after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas—despite constituting a majority of the population within the State—will continue to be underrepresented in the political process.” In the Janus case, where the Court’s five Republicans overruled a 1977 Supreme Court opinion, as well as the laws on the books in 22 states, to gut a key funding source for public-sector unions. If you read the majority opinions in the above cases, you’ll see the Court’s Republican Justices repeatedly suggesting they need to ignore a plethora of relevant facts, comments, and history in order to give due deference to federal and state legislators. That deference dissolved in this ruling, with the Court deciding this question could no longer be left to voters or lawmakers. The decision weakens a powerful Democratic interest group, which is one reason Republicans have fought so hard, for so long, for a judgment like this. The Court, wrote Justice Elena Kagan in an angry dissent, has become “black-robed rulers overriding citizens’ choices.” The Court refused to set limits on even extreme cases of partisan gerrymandering, sending multiple gerrymandering cases back down to lower courts, at least for now. These rulings were more technical, and less partisan, but they dashed the hopes of those who believed the Court might finally step in to set limits on how aggressively politicians could choose their voters and harden their majorities. Though the Court held open the possibility of revisiting this issue if brought to them in another way, since Kennedy was the key swing vote, the future of these challenges looks grim. And, again, these are just cases from the last term. A fuller accounting of the Court’s electoral interventions would include the 2000 Bush v. Gore case (which Justice David Souter believed so “crudely partisan” a decision he considered resigning); the constellation of decisions emanating from Citizens United, which have allowed corporations and billionaires to dump literally unlimited amounts of money into elections; and the 2013 gutting of crucial provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which has already had disturbing consequences. “Whatever mythology existed around the idea that the Court wasn’t pure power and pure winners and losers is gone,” says Lithwick. All this is coming in the context of a political system that is becoming less and less representative of public opinion. Since 2000, 40 percent of presidential elections have been won by the loser of the popular vote; the Senate, due to its small-state bias, has a Republican majority despite the fact that more Americans voted for Senate Democrats in 2016 than Senate Republicans; and in the House, due to both gerrymandering and geography, Democrats are projected to need to win the popular vote by around 7 points (or as much as 11 points) to take back control of the chamber. Demographers project American politics will become even less democratic in the coming years. By 2040, 70 percent of Americans are expected to be represented by a mere 30 senators, which means 30 percent of the population will control a 70-vote supermajority in the Senate. The Supreme Court is meant to be insulated from democracy. It’s not meant to be a partisan tool for undermining democracy. What’s emerging now is a dangerous loop, in which Republicans barely holding onto power manage to keep control of the Supreme Court by any means necessary, and in return, the Supreme Court’s Republican appointees issue rulings to help their party cling to political power. In the long term, that’s bad for the country’s unity and the Court’s legitimacy. Already, frustrated liberals are beginning to discuss packing the Court — after McConnell’s refusal to give Garland a hearing, it’s hard to argue that there are any norms or limits left on the war for judicial power. And even those most invested in the Court’s grandeur are finding it hard to defend its reality. “One of the paradoxes that I always noticed in the Supreme Court press corps,” says Lithwick, “was we do believe this fiction that the Court is completely apolitical — except that we don’t, because we are careful to say ‘appointed by a Republican.’ We live on the seam of the two realities. We really do believe in order to do our jobs that what the Court does is different from raw politics. And yet we’re not stupid. We were there for Bush v. Gore. We know how this shakes out.” “At what point,” she continued, “do I throw up my hands and say, ‘Okay, let’s do away with lifetime tenure, because this whole thing is pointless?’ In which case, I should just be a White House correspondent, right?” Listen here, or subscribe to the Ezra Klein Show wherever you get your podcasts.

        "articles": "“The most transformative presidents in our nation’s history — Lincoln, FDR, LBJ — were not ideologues.” Progressive groups overwhelmingly favored confrontational leftists like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren during the 2020 primary campaign. And many pretty clearly favored younger, more diverse rising stars like Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg over Joe Biden. Biden, after all, is not only a paid-up member of the “establishment,” he’s a veteran of the long shadow cast over American politics by Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan — a guy who voted in favor of the invasion of Iraq, of multiple pieces of legislation deregulating the banking industry, of the 1994 welfare reform bill, and of the “tough on crime” 1994 criminal justice bill. Biden is now the presumptive nominee, but progressives still fundamentally do not see him or his team as kindred spirits. Many, however, are becoming more optimistic about Bidenism. His platform is in many ways a surprisingly progressive approach to policy that the left sees as a triumph of their own work in trying to change the terms of debate in American politics. Biden “envisions a massive public sector role for job creation,” points out Faiz Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders’s 2016 campaign. He doesn’t think Biden has suddenly become a left-wing hero. But he credits Biden, Biden’s team, and mainstream Democrats more broadly with “understanding that in Covid times there needs to be thinking about bold practical measures.” Republicans have so far failed in their attempt to convince moderate voters that Biden is a socialist snake in the grass. Even as broader American society sees a genuine upsurge of left-wing radicalism both in the streets and in the realm of ideas, public perception of Biden continues to hold that he is closer to the middle ground than President Donald Trump. Republicans have been reduced to trying to argue that Biden is just a Trojan horse for other, far more left-wing, figures in the party. But it’s an argument that founders since Americans just watched Biden win an extended primary campaign in which he was repeatedly assailed for failing to meet various progressive litmus tests. Biden won the primary handily by convincingly slapping a moderate label on a policy agenda that is nonetheless far bolder than the one pursued by Barack Obama or proposed by Hillary Clinton in 2016. “That’s his genius now,” one pillar of the Democratic establishment who’d initially preferred several younger candidates from the moderate lane told me. Biden is not progressives’ champion: He does not push the envelope in the ways they want, and he has not endorsed their most ambitious ideas. But public opinion has been shifting leftward, and Biden’s thinking has shifted with it, creating a platform that progressives are genuinely excited about. It’s “the most progressive platform of any Democratic nominee in the modern history of the party,” Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats, a group famous (or infamous) for backing left-wing challengers to incumbent congressional Democrats, tells me. They also see his approach as a triumph of sorts in changing the scope of what is acceptable to discuss in national politics. The “Overton window” came up repeatedly. The idea is that at any given time, only a certain set of ideas is deemed worthy of mainstream discussion, and where the contours of that set, or window, are located has meaningful impact on political outcomes. Ideas like Medicare-for-all, a Green New Deal, defunding the police, and wealth taxation did not win in the primary, but they did establish significant beachheads in public consciousness and contribute to an environment in which Biden's very ambitious agenda can be seen as moderate. Biden, says Shakir, “is not leading the Overton window movement, but he’s also not disregarding or moving against it.” Shahid observes that “the most transformative presidents in our nation’s history — Lincoln, FDR, LBJ — were not ideologues fully aligned with the most radical movements of their time.” Instead, they at times worked with activists to move the ball forward and at other times trimmed their sails to meet the constraints of public opinion. Police reform, a topic that was not at the forefront of the public agenda during the primary, is nonetheless a spot-on case study in how Biden threads the needle between an increasingly influential left and an unpopular incumbent president. The mass public has grown considerably more skeptical of American policing over the past four years, according to a Pew survey released last week. In contrast to the prevailing attitudes of 2016, most Americans now say the police do a poor job of calibrating their use of force appropriately to the situation, that they do a poor job of treating all racial groups equally, and that they do a poor job of holding themselves accountable when misconduct occurs. That creates a public mood now favorable to many reform ideas Biden has embraced, like curbing qualified immunity, conditioning federal police funding on new training and diversity initiatives, and reinvigorating federal oversight of police departments. What left-wing activists want Biden and other politicians to do, however, is defund the police, an idea that Biden does not support. The window of discussion has shifted left, and Biden sits squarely in the middle of it — a onetime champion of “tough on crime” politics who’s now backing a once-unthinkable list of reform demands. He’s helped in staking out this ground because policing issues have in some ways become less racially divisive inside the Democratic Party coalition. “Overwhelming shares of Democrats of all races support reforms,” Jocelyn Kiley, the associate director of research at Pew, tells me. And when it comes to cutting police funding, the idea is popular with younger Democrats but unpopular overall, and that’s true across racial groups. “By and large, that support is equally high among white Democrats as it is among Black and Hispanic [Democrats].” Kiley helped me break down the numbers in a different way and explains that among Democrats, 43 percent of whites, 42 percent of African Americans, and 32 percent of Hispanics want to see cuts, with the rest preferring either flat or increased funding. Indeed, increasing police spending is more popular with Black and Hispanic Democrats than with white ones. But as my colleague Aaron Ross Coleman writes, a narrow focus on police funding ignores an important point: “Black people view poor policing as an aspect of a broader state failure to provide adequate public goods and services.” And that’s where the progressive side of Biden’s agenda shines through. While Trump would clearly like to ride a white backlash against Black Lives Matter to reelection, in reality he has ceded the middle ground in the culture war to Biden. Trump is refusing to acknowledge any need for change. Biden eschews a unpopular headline demand while embracing reform proposals that activists do like and the mass public is now willing to listen to. And he can get away with it with his base of working-class African Americans in part because when it comes to the public investment side of the ledger, Biden is squarely there, especially with regard to low-income communities. Indeed, as Ezra Klein and Roge Karma wrote in December, the dynamic of the 2020 primary was that on economic policy, “by the standards of the Democratic Party in 2008, the moderates look like leftists.” Then on health care, especially as modified by the joint task force with Bernie Sanders, Biden’s plans are more aggressive than they sound, featuring a Medicare-administered public option that, as Ella Nilsen explains, “would cover a range of people, including low-income Americans who are not eligible for Medicaid, and anyone who elects to choose the public option from the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Those who currently get health insurance from their employers would also be eligible.” Biden’s health plan also features the extremely mundane-sounding idea of switching the ACA subsidy formula to be pegged to the price of a gold plan rather than a silver plan. This means, basically, extra money for every family earning less than 400 percent of the poverty line. (Biden has also pledged to lift the subsidy cap for people earning more than that.) This is all a formally race-neutral agenda, but given the realities of American economic life, it amounts to not just a game changer for low-income households but a significant blow to the systemic economic gaps between Black and white Americans. Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders’s campaign, says the Biden agenda is strikingly progressive on these points not despite Biden’s moderate profile but because of it. Biden “starts with a politics of what’s possible at a particular moment and time,” he says, and the broad consensus in the Democratic Party is that what’s possible has changed. Shahid uses the same analogy: “Progressives often shift the Overton window and the establishment steps through the door a few years later ($15 minimum wage is a good example), while the left moves on to other policies.” The task force process probably scored its biggest win for the left on the subject of climate change, where a group co-chaired by John Kerry and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accelerated the pace at which Biden calls for electricity to be 100 percent carbon-free. Today the 6 Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces are unveiling final language.The Climate Task Force accomplished a great deal. It was an honor to serve as co-chair w/ Sec. @JohnKerry.Among the notable gains: we shaved *15 years* off Biden’s previous target for 100% clean energy.  Varshini Prakash, the co-chair of the Sunrise Movement, hailed the outcome of the process, saying that “we now have a Democratic unity position that begins to reflect what young people have been shouting relentlessly — that the climate crisis is not some far off threat.” Sealing the deal here was eased somewhat by the unique dynamics of the climate issue. On health care, the left-coded position involves replacing existing private insurance with a government-funded program, which requires broad-based tax increases that make moderate Democrats wary. On climate, by contrast, the longstanding dynamic has been that moderates want to focus climate efforts on carbon pricing (which is to say, an unpopular broad-based tax increase), while the left derides this as neoliberalism and calls for a more command-and-control approach. Biden is a decidedly moderate politician but less of a wonkish technocrat type than Obama was, so he’s happy to deemphasize a politically unpopular moderate idea. Instead, task force proposals (like earlier work from House Democrats on forging a party consensus) focus on the stick of regulation and the carrot of massive public investment (both of which generally poll well) while avoiding calls from climate activists for bans on fracking and nuclear power that alienated labor unions and some moderates. Here, as on health, poverty, and police reform, Biden is essentially stepping into the sweet spot of the Overton window, and activists are happy with the result. The same could be true on immigration if the stars align correctly, but it also could turn into the difficult exception to the rule. Of course, not everything works out so neatly. On the immigration disputes that have at times defined Trump-era politics, the three-way tug-of-war among activist demands, public opinion, and the institutional realities of American government are complicated. On an aspirational level, Biden’s immigration plan takes the core Obama-era concept of a path to citizenship for the long-settled and otherwise law-abiding unauthorized immigrant population and runs with it. While the “Gang of 8” legislation that Obama championed paired that idea with huge investments in more stringent border enforcement, Biden’s current proposals don’t take that direction. Instead, they entail a forthright expansion of legal immigration by eliminating certain caps on green card issuance. This would have been a risky political stance in Obama’s day, but Gallup recently reported that for the first time on record, more Americans favor increasing rather than decreasing immigration flows. If Democrats score a huge landslide win, picking up many Senate seats, and then contrive to end the filibuster, it’s possible that something like this — perhaps incorporating some enforcement ideas progressives don’t like or limiting the ambitions somewhat — will happen and it will all go according to plan. But if not, Biden is going to be stuck in the much more treacherous situation of presiding over an immigration enforcement apparatus that’s been taken with the mission of deporting a population that, theoretically, Democrats believe should be legalized and set on a path to citizenship. “The big thing to remember is that Obama was not universally loved among immigration advocates,” says Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, but activists “pushed him in his second term into becoming a lot more lenient on some issues of immigration.” That pivot, from being the “deporter-in-chief” who set a record for removals that Trump has not yet matched to attempting a sweeping series of executive actions to bestow formal protection from deportation on millions of people, involved a long series of tough battles. The Obama administration tried, fitfully, to push the immigration enforcement apparatus to exercise more discretion in whom it targeted — facing both a lot of internal pushback from front-line US attorneys and immigration agents and a lot of blowback from advocates who said he wasn’t meeting his commitments. Trump has very much thrown the levers in the opposite direction, and reversing course in a substantive way will involve taking on some in-the-weeds battles. Reichlin-Melnick predicts that when it comes to staffing DHS and DOJ and actually implementing policy, there’s going to be “a fight between making symbolic changes and making systemic changes.” Similarly, Biden has formally committed to not just rolling back the cruelest aspects of Trump’s clamp-down on asylum but to generally walking away from the deterrence-oriented approach that Obama took as well. That’s easy to say in private meetings with activists or even around a policy task force negotiating table that also features a half-dozen higher-profile issues. But immigration activists have real doubts as to whether Biden would stick with that plan if arrivals start surging again, and cautious politicos have real doubts as to whether it would be wise to do so. On enforcement topics in general, the left has won a lot of elite battles inside the Democratic Party, but it’s less clear how much the larger window of public opinion has really shifted or how much those newfound views will hold together without Trump as a foil. The practical functioning of the American government is never so neat and tidy as a bunch of plans on a piece of paper. Contemporary administrations do what they can through the legislative process and then fall back on controlling the machinery of the administrative state. And here, as Elizabeth Warren (quoting Reagan-era conservatives) likes to say, the key point is that “personnel is policy.” You can love Bidenism without loving Joe Biden, but when legislative dealmaking breaks down and it becomes incredibly relevant who holds which sub-Cabinet jobs, the personal identity of the Biden team becomes a much bigger deal. That’s why many progressives have become so invested in pushing Warren as a VP option — they’d like her Rolodex as close to the West Wing as possible. Biden’s transition team, though still skeletal at this point, is encouraging to the left; it’s headed by Ted Kaufman, who is probably the most progressive member of the true Biden inner circle. But that inner circle also includes Bruce Reed, a longtime bête noir of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, and is generally (as you would expect) a very establishment-oriented group of people. Realistically, an administration led by Barack Obama’s vice president is going to feature a lot of personnel continuity with the Obama administration, whether the left likes it or not. The establishment’s own views have, however, shifted considerably to the left over the past 15 years, in part as a result of changes in the objective environment and in part because of shifts in public opinion. In that sense, moderate Joe is nobody’s Trojan horse. But it’s still the case that when you peek at what’s inside, it’s a much more transformative agenda than a superficial glance at the outcome of the primaries would lead you to believe.

        "articles": "“I can't remember a president who has had more authoritarian tendencies than Trump.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders may have lost his bid for the White House in 2016, but he’s sure as hell not ready to fade into obscurity anytime soon. Instead, he’s emerged as a gadfly, loudly and publicly sounding the alarm on what he sees as the country’s troubling descent into authoritarianism under President Donald Trump. “I can't remember a president who has had more authoritarian tendencies than Trump,” Sanders told me in an interview on Wednesday. “What is going on is not only this rise of authoritarianism but also, simultaneously, you are seeing this country move very rapidly toward oligarchy.” As Sanders prepared to give a big speech on Thursday at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he got on the phone with me to talk about Trump’s admiration for authoritarian leaders, his attacks on the media, the Russia investigation, and more. Sanders told me he believes Trump has a basic disrespect for the fundamental pillars of democracy — the press, the judicial system — that mimics the authoritarian regimes the Trump administration has cozied up to around the globe. And that combination, he says, is dangerous. What follows is a partial transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for clarity and length. There has never been a president, or even a leading public official, who has lied as often or as dangerously as Trump has. And when the president of the United States lies a whole lot and makes outrageous statements, it's not only bad unto itself, but it also opens the door for other people to be lying and for truth to be disrespected. And that is a very dangerous thing for the fabric of American society. When he talks about 3 to 5 million people voting illegally in the last election — no one believes that, it is an outrageous lie —- but what that does is tell Republican governors that they should go forward to suppress the vote, to make it harder for people to vote, under the guise of voter fraud. Every politician has disagreements with the media and how they cover this or that story, and I am certainly one of those. But there has never been a president, or political leader, who has basically said, “Everything you see on mainstream television or mainstream media — the New York Times, the Washington Post, , whatever it may be — is a lie, don’t believe it.” If you take that to its logical conclusion, and some people have, then where do you get the truth? Where do you learn about what’s going on that you can’t see with your own eyes? Who’s going to help you? It kind of leads you to the conclusion that there is only one person in America who can tell us the truth, and that is the president of the United States. Do you think he’s a demagogue? Well, I think that ... let me continue and then you can ask me a question, fair enough? Okay. So you have this unprecedented attack on the media. What this guy is doing is basically telling the American people, “You cannot trust anything in mainstream media.” Then, on top of that, he is attacking the judiciary system and Department of Justice. A judge rules against him — that is not unusual; judges often rule against presidents and against legislation — but you don't go around undermining the judiciary and calling people “so-called judges” because they ruled against you. Then on top of that, you have his support for authoritarian leaders. The American people, I think, whether you are a Republican or Democrat, have a hard time understanding his affection for a guy like [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, who has worked overtime to undermine not only democracy in his own country but also democracy in the United States. Do you want a good relationship with Russia? Of course you do. But why would you have what appears to be a personal affection for an authoritarian leader? It is not just Putin. It is also [President Rodrigo] Duterte of the Philippines; it is the royal family of Saudi Arabia. Again: You may want to make alliances, you may not; those are debates you have to have. But for a country like the United States, which has been seen, historically, as one of the great promoters of democracy, why have this affinity for so many authoritarian countries? I have spoken to conservatives who share these exact same concerns. Do you see this as a global phenomenon? Why do you think we may be seeing public support around the world for authoritarian characters or politicians? And, go back to my original question, do you think he is a demagogue — is that what you are moving toward saying? Let me take the last question first. Both good questions. You can contrast this with a very conservative Republican president named George W. Bush. I opposed Bush on virtually every piece legislation, every initiative, he put forward. Virtually all of them. But if you remember, Bush’s response to 9/11 was to visit a mosque — a very profound statement for a conservative Republican — essentially what he was saying is that we have to stand together, don't judge people by religion or by the color of their skin, and that America is a country which belongs to all of us. Contrast that with Trump’s effort to start a program in which is he is documenting every crime an undocumented person commits, [his] verbal attacks against Latinos and against Muslims, and his effort, it seems to me, to try to make political points by dividing us up by scapegoating minorities. That is not what a leader of any democratic country should be doing. That is part of the tradition and history of demagoguery. It divides people up. That leads to your other question: Is this happening around the world? The answer is yes, it is. And why is it happening? For a lot of the same reasons it is happening in the United States. The radical changes to the global economy over the last 40 to 50 years, which have benefited some people, no question about it, but have left behind tens and tens of millions of people who are today working longer hours for lower wages, who are worried to death about whether their kids can afford to go to college and whether their kids will ever have a standard of living as high as they themselves have. A whole lot of people have been left behind in the global economy, in the United States — in rural areas, in inner cities all over this country. A lot of people have been left behind, and they are angry, they are furious, and they think people do not understand their pain. And then you have demagogues trying to explain that the problem is some Mexican farm worker who makes eight bucks an hour or someone who is a Muslim. Tens and tens of millions of Americans today are struggling to keep heads above water economically. What rational leadership is about is putting those problems on the table and saying, “All right, here are problems: We’ve got 28 million Americans with no health insurance. How do we deal with that issue?” rather than demagoguing about that issue and blaming minorities for the problems the country faces. This is certainly an international phenomenon — you see it with the National Front in France, and you see [a] similar type phenomenon with Putin in Russia. In Berlin this May, you gave a speech where you said, “What has become absolutely clear since the election is that Donald Trump represents something we haven’t seen before in the United States. A trend toward authoritarianism, a normalization of corruption and the rise of oligarchy.” Can you unpack the last part of that sentence? You got my quote right. What is going on is not only this rise of authoritarianism but also, simultaneously, you are seeing this country move very rapidly toward oligarchy. The media doesn't talk about it very often. I do. Because it's frightening, and I don't think the media is comfortable with it — but the truth is in America today, you have the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and you’ve got 20 people in America owning as much wealth as [the] bottom half of America, and you are seeing 52 percent of all new income generated today going to the top 1 percent. So just an incredible inequality, in terms of wealth and income, that we have not seen since the Great Depression, since 1928. On top of that, [we have] a political system in which the Koch brothers and other billionaires are able to spend unlimited sums through Citizens United to buy elections for the candidates who represent their interests. You add that together with a media which is also increasingly owned by fewer and fewer people around the world. I think it is fair to say we are moving toward oligarchy, where we have an economy and a political system controlled by few incredibly wealthy people. And [as to] the corruption aspect of this: There is an incredible blurring of business interests for the Trump family with public policy. Is Trump making foreign policy decisions on behalf of the American people and what is best for the world? Or is he making those decisions on behalf of Trump enterprises? That’s a whole other area. There seems little doubt that Russians attempted in some way to influence our election. How has this played out in terms of how you see the Trump administration moving toward authoritarianism? Well, that’s a question that obviously is being investigated right now. You are right there is nobody who denies that Russia played a significant role in trying to influence the election on behalf of Trump. So the question being investigated now is was there collusion? And you have [special counsel Robert] Mueller and his team working on that, and you have the House and Senate Intelligence Committees working on that. We will see where that will go. I don’t have the answer, and I don't want to speak before I have facts in front of us. Trump fired [FBI Director James] Comey. Did he fire Comey because he thought Comey was a bad FBI director and he needed a change in the FBI? If that is the case, that is what a president can do. Or did he fire Comey because Comey was launching a significant investigation about possible collusion of the Trump campaign with Russia? If that’s the case, then that's just another argument about the movement of this country toward authoritarianism, because that is obstructing justice. And that’s what’s being looked at. You said a few times that this is a first in American history — but there are aspects of these issues that have repeated themselves throughout history. Do you think this a repeat of something we saw in the 1930s, for example, or otherwise? Bernie Sanders Yes and no. Yes — look, we had Joe McCarthy. But I don't know if you have had a president whose actions —- in terms of dishonesty, clear dishonesty, in terms of the attacks on the media, trying to undermine people’s faith in what they see, hear, and read, and support for authoritarian regimes — I don't know if you have had a president who has put all of these characteristics together at one time. I can't remember a president who has had more authoritarian tendencies than Trump. Sarah Wildman What role do you think the media needs to play? What happens when you undermine the Fourth Estate? Trump says, [essentially] “Hey all of these, ABC, CBS, , everybody else, anybody in the mainstream media, they are all liars, they hate me, they are trying to undermine me, so don't believe a word of it.” What does that tell the average person in this country? Where will they get the truth? That is a very profound development. After all, where do you get truth? How do you get truth? How do you know what is going on in Washington, DC? Is it just Trump's tweets? I think when a president says, “This is a [news] story, I disagree with it, this is why I disagree with it” — there’s nothing wrong with that. I do that every day. But to say, “Everything you are seeing in the media is a lie” — wow, that is pretty dangerous stuff. You mentioned the National Front earlier — there was great anxiety that she had a chance to succeed, but actually, in the end, Marine Le Pen, and the far right in France, was profoundly unsuccessful. What was different there that we didn't experience here? Let’s not forget that if you had a popular vote that was announced at 11 pm on election night — [Hillary] Clinton won the popular vote by 2.9 million votes. That’s a difference. Emmanuel Macron did not go through a complicated Electoral College which allowed someone who received a minority of the votes to become president; that’s one of the differences. That’s a good discussion. Maybe we can have it another time.

        "articles": "I was a liberal adjunct professor at a large university until 2013, and my liberal students never scared me at all. I covered sensitive topics in my courses, including rape, capital punishment, female genital mutilation, and disputed accounts of mass atrocities. Our classroom debates were contentious, and forced students to examine their own biases. I kept an \"on-call\" list that pressured students to participate actively in those discussions. I did not use trigger warnings. I never had any complaints. I bring up my own experiences as a reminder that if the plural of anecdote isn't data, the singular of it sure as hell isn't, either. The fact that I enjoyed my time teaching doesn't tell you anything about the state of education in America — and neither does the fact that the pseudonymous author of this  article is a liberal professor who is terrified of his liberal students. And yet the response to his article, which as of this writing has now been shared more than 190,000 times on Facebook, shows it has struck a nerve. This is something people are genuinely concerned about — enough that the thoughts of an unidentified man from the Midwest feel like a revelation, as if some secret truth everyone suspected has finally been exposed. In other words, it's truthy: it offers a conclusion that feels as if it should be true, even though it isn't accompanied by much in the way of actual evidence. In this case, that truthy conclusion is that the rise of identity politics is doing real harm — that this new kind of discourse, whether you call it \"identity politics\" or \"call-out culture\" or \"political correctness,\" is not just annoying or upsetting to the people it targets, but a danger to academic freedom and therefore an actual substantive problem to be addressed. In fact, a closer read of the article shows that the actual problem the professor faces isn't the rise of a scary new breed of students. Students, after all, have been complaining about their professors and just about everything else since time immemorial. Rather, if university faculty are feeling disempowered in their classrooms, that's because they do, in fact, have less power at work: the shrinking pool of tenure-track jobs and the corresponding rise in the numbers of poorly paid adjuncts means many university teachers are in a precarious position right now. Students have been complaining about their professors since time immemorial The American Association of University Professors reports that 76 percent of faculty across all US institutions are adjuncts — non-tenured contract positions that universities can terminate or not renew at will. Those uncertain jobs are also poorly paid — a study from the US House of Representatives last year found that a majority of adjuncts live below the poverty line, and that they rarely have access to health, retirement, or other benefits. Tenure-track jobs are comparatively rare, and even tenure itself may be becoming a political target: Wisconsin Governor and GOP presidential hopeful Scott Walker is pushing legislation that would weaken tenure protections for state university professors. That means that, as 's anonymous correspondent wrote in his article, \"the academic job market is brutal. Teachers who are not tenured or tenure-track faculty members have no right to due process before being dismissed, and there's a mile-long line of applicants eager to take their place.\" In that context, it's hardly surprising that non-tenured university lecturers would take an extremely conservative approach to any perceived threat to their job security. As the \"liberal professor\" wrote, \"In this type of environment, boat-rocking isn't just dangerous, it's suicidal, and so teachers limit their lessons to things they know won't upset anybody.\" That is a real issue, with real implications for education, and for academic freedom. But pinning the blame on students' embrace of identity politics is a mistake. If adjuncts and junior faculty members feel insecure enough to censor their teaching or work, then that's a problem in their relationship with their universities, not in their relationships with their students. Indeed, in that academic environment, it wouldn't matter if liberal identity politics disappeared tomorrow. Some students will always be unhappy about something, and if faculty are this nervous, that will influence their teaching. Indeed, the article notes that the only actual complaint the professor ever received was from a conservative student angry at his \"communistical\" tendencies because he refused to blame poor black homeowners for the 2008 financial crisis. The problem isn't the substance of student complaints — the problem is that university lecturers are so terrified of the effect student complaints could have. That's a problem to be solved by universities having faculty members' backs, not by somehow silencing the debate over identity politics. Of course, an article about the employment challenges for today's budding academics probably wouldn't have been shared 190,000 times on Facebook. The professor's article didn't inspire columns in the National Review or the Wall Street Journal because their conservative authors are so concerned about the working conditions of adjunct professors. Rather, the article garnered so much attention because it seems like it's raising new evidence that identity politics is a bad thing — not just a kind of discourse that some people dislike — by identifying real harm. In January, liberal writer Jonathan Chait took a stab at doing something similar in New York Magazine, critiquing political correctness by claiming it was an attempt to \"expand freedom for the oppressed by eliminating it for their enemies,\" and that such efforts were doomed to undermine the freedom they sought to protect. And now the  article seems to suggest that the harm is to academic freedom: even the professors are scared! These kids today with their identity politics are threatening the academy! It's not surprising that people are eager to grasp at such conclusions, because without some kind of real harm to point to, critiques of identity politics collapse in on themselves. As Matt Yglesias wrote in January, the term \"identity politics\" is generally used to refer to feminist or anti-racist critiques, but that assumes that traditionally marginalized groups are the only people with an \"identity.\" \"The implication of this usage,\" Yglesias wrote, \"is that somehow an identity is something only women or African Americans or perhaps LGBT people have. White men just have ideas about politics that spring from a realm of pure reason, with concerns that are by definition universal.\" Citing the supposed threat to the academy is another way to claim that arguments against identity politics are rooted in pure reason and are trying to protect universal concerns, rather than silence specific concerns raised by marginalized people that we'd rather not listen to. (After all, if you're going to dismiss campus identity politics as a debate \"in which the feelings of individuals are the primary or even exclusive means through which social issues are understood and discussed,\" as the anonymous professor does, then you need to come up with something beyond your own feelings to explain why that's a problem.) But \"identity politics are bad\" is the wrong lesson to take from the experiences of the professor who wrote for . If adjuncts and tenure-track professors are disempowered in relation to their students, the solution isn't to attack students, as the professor did, sneering at undergraduates with too many feelings or an unsuspecting woman who had the misfortune of tweeting about the biases of scientific research and discourse. Rather, it's to focus on a university system that treats students as customers and faculty as the interchangeable means of production. If you care about academic freedom, care about that.

        "articles": "Republican senators want the author of the “pee tape” document arrested. Devin Nunes’ controversial memo has put Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer who worked during the 2016 campaign cycle on compiling a dossier alleging the existence of a conspiracy between Donald Trump and the Russian government. That brings the Steele dossier — yes, this is the document alleging the existence of a “pee tape” that the Russians may have used to blackmail Trump — to a strange point. Its origins of liberal hopes of exposing a massive conspiracy that would bring Trump down have led to its current status as the center of a conservative conspiracy theory that’s supposed to bring Robert Mueller down. The allegations in the dossier played essentially no role in either the GOP primary or the general election, and, contrary to the dueling myths of left- and right-wing conspiracy theorists, it is not the case that subsequent investigation has vindicated the dossier’s claims or that the Trump investigation is primarily based on those claims. It’s a piece of ephemera whose waxing and waning reputation and varied political valence says more about the shifting politics of Trump and Russia than anything else. Fusion GPS, the company that created the dossier, was co-founded in 2011 by Glenn Simpson, Peter Fritsch, and Thomas Catan — three former Wall Street Journal journalists who were part of a larger 21st-century trend of experienced reporters adapting to the changing economic climate by leaving the field in favor of various forms of “strategic intelligence” or research for hire. The company’s extremely terse website describes it as simply providing “premium research, strategic intelligence, and due diligence services to corporations, law firms, and investors worldwide.” As a DC-based firm, some of their work has been political. A 2012 Wall Street Journal op-ed revealed that Fusion GPS worked for Democrats doing opposition research on Mitt Romney. According to Free Beacon editor Matthew Continetti and chair Michael Goldfarb, the firm was were engaged early in the 2016 cycle “to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary.” Later, in April 2016, Marc Elias — a top Democratic campaign lawyer — retained Fusion GPS through his firm of Perkins Coie on behalf of both Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Perkins Coie, at Elias’s behest and with the bills ultimately paid by Clinton and the DNC, continued to fund Fusion’s work through the end of October 2016, though the people involved say that neither the campaign nor the DNC was aware of the details of Fusion’s work. Fusion, in turn, subcontracted with Christopher Steele, a retired MI-6 officer with considerable expertise on Russian matters, to use his contacts in Moscow to find what he could about Trump’s connections to the Russian government. That work led to the compilation of Steele’s dossier, written up in the style of an intelligence report and based on unnamed sources, that contained a variety of serious charges against Trump. Steele’s dossier circulated in the media during the fall of 2016, but news organizations largely failed to verify any of its key claims. Steele also shared the document with the FBI, where it was apparently taken at least somewhat seriously in light of Steele’s record as an intelligence professional, and the existence of the dossier was subsequently revealed by David Corn of Mother Jones on October 31. Corn’s story did not play a particularly large role in what remained of the election campaign, and though the Clinton campaign certainly threw some Russia-related charges at Trump, the issue was not a centerpiece of her message. That swiftly changed in the wake of Trump’s unexpected victory. The Obama administration had to an extent downplayed what it knew about Russia’s election-related activities during the course of the campaign, trying to keep partisan politics separate from a national security issue. Officials were also reasonably confident that Clinton would win. Once she lost, the calculus changed to an extent, and the administration began to pull back the curtain on the extent of Russian activism around the election. But to say that the Russian government invested resources in boosting Trump’s fortunes is not to say that Trump was a pawn of the Kremlin. The notion that Trump was in some sense in cahoots with the Russians had, however, been widely bandied about in a range of contexts for months — we know now that back in June 2016, even House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was joking that Trump was on Putin’s payroll — and was part of liberals’ desperate fantasy that a group of rogue “Hamilton Electors” would somehow step in and block Trump from taking office. It was in this context that BuzzFeed decided to bring the public in on what had been circulating for a while in media circles and publish the full dossier on January 10, 2017. The dossier, compiled by a credible person though lacking any kind of independent verification, charged that Trump was in fact under the influence of Russian intelligence services, who had a longstanding relationship with the president-elect and had also compiled salacious blackmail material on him. One core claim of the Steele dossier, contentious during the course of the 2016 campaign but widely agreed upon now: There was, in fact, a multifaceted Kremlin-directed influence campaign aimed at boosting Trump’s electoral fortunes. An official US intelligence community assessment released in January says that was the case, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigations have reached the same conclusion, and even though Trump personally continues to dispute this, people he has appointed to top intelligence jobs agree that it’s true. The dossier of course goes well beyond that, to make six major claims about Trump’s ties to Russia that really haven’t been borne out by any subsequent reporting or investigation that we know of. 1) Trump had cooperated with Russian authorities for years. A core claim of the dossier is that Russia “had been feeding Trump and his team valuable intelligence on his opponents,” including Clinton, for “several years” before 2016, and that in exchange, Trump’s team fed the Kremlin intelligence on Russian oligarchs and their families “for at least eight years.” The premise of this theory, that many Russian nationals have bought Trump-branded properties and thus he might be in a position to offer useful information to Russian authorities, is clearly correct, but nothing like it has been shown to be true. 2) Trump is vulnerable to Russian blackmail on sexual matters. The dossier states that during a trip to the Moscow Ritz-Carlton, Trump hired prostitutes to “perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) show in front of him”, “defiling” the presidential suite bed in which the Obamas had previously slept, with the implication being that Russian intelligence taped this and that it was one of several forms of “kompromat” the Russians have on Trump. Nothing like this has been proven. 3) There was a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” between Trump and Russia. Steele describes a Trump-Russia “conspiracy,” managed by Paul Manafort, with Carter Page serving as intermediary until Manafort’s firing in August 2016, after which point Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen played an increasingly large role in managing the “Kremlin relationship.” This is broadly similar to some things that have been demonstrated later, but totally different in the details. 4) Trump’s team knew and approved of Russian plans to deliver emails to WikiLeaks, and offered them policy concessions in exchange. The dossier claims that Trump and his campaign team had “full knowledge and support” of Russia’s leak of the DNC emails to WikiLeaks, and that in return, Trump’s team “had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue.” This is obviously a subject of ongoing investigation, but none of the conversations about Russian dirt on Clinton that have come to light so far demonstrate what the dossier claims. 5) Carter Page played a key role in the conspiracy. The dossier says that according to an “ethnic Russian associate” of Trump’s, Carter Page had “conceived and promoted” the idea that the DNC emails to WikiLeaks should be leaked during the Democratic convention, “to swing supporters of Bernie Sanders away from Hilary Clinton and across from Trump.” It also says Page met senior Russian official Igor Diveykin to talk kompromat on Clinton, and met with Igor Sechin to discussion financial payoffs to Page and others via the privatization of the Russian company Rosneft. Page has denied under oath having met either Diveykin or Sechin, and there’s no indication he had anything to do with the timing of the WikiLeaks release. 6) Michael Cohen played a key role in the conspiracy. The dossier says that after Paul Manafort was fired, Cohen traveled to a European Union country (later reports claim it was the Czech Republic) in late August or early September to meet with Russian officials, and that the meeting took place under the cover of a Russian NGO, Rossotrudnichestvo. One topic of this meeting was “coverup and damage limitation” around Manafort’s Ukrainian work and efforts to “prevent the full details of Trump’s relationship with Russia being exposed.” According to the dossier, after August, Cohen continued to manage Trump’s relations with Russia, but after this point, contacts were made to Russia’s “trusted agents of influence” instead of officials. Cohen also supposedly discussed how to make “deniable cash payments” to hackers working under Kremlin direction, and how to cover up those operations. Cohen’s purported proof that he’s never been to Prague — showing a passport that lacks a Czech Republic stamp — is unconvincing because he could have traveled to Prague via another Schengen area country and might have multiple passports. But none of this has been proven. A number of articles have been published in recent months that, on their surface, feature journalists claiming that the core contentions of the Steele dossier have been proven. Much of this is questionable framing. Bertrand’s article, for example, cites Page testifying to Congress that he met with Rosneft’s head of investor relations and briefly with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich as supporting key portions of the Steele dossier. What the dossier actually says, however, is that Page met with Igor Diveykin (a Russian intelligence official) and Igor Sechin (the CEO of Rosneft). In some sense, this confirms Steele’s reporting, in that the broad strokes of Page’s testimony are similar to some of the things Steele said. But in another sense, Page is testifying that Steele got key facts wrong. The most one can really say has been confirmed about the Steele dossier is that a) there was in fact a Russian effort to help Trump, and b) the Trump camp clearly knew more about it than they said publicly. Given those conclusions, it’s certainly possible that the other stuff Steele alleges is also true, but virtually none of the particulars have been verified. Conversely, one striking thing about what’s been reported over the past year is how much actual Trump-Russia contact Steele didn’t find out about. The dossier doesn’t mention Natalia Veselnitskaya, for example, a Russian lawyer with very real Kremlin links who really did hold a meeting at Trump Tower with key Trump campaign officials to discuss a deal involving dirt on Hillary Clinton being swapped for concessions on sanctions. Emin Agalarov and Rob Goldstone, who helped set the meeting up, aren’t mentioned either. George Papadopolous, a former Trump campaign staffer who has pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and appears to be a key figure in the Mueller investigation, doesn’t come up in the dossier. Nor are Donald Trump Jr. or Jared Kushner important figures in it. These revelations certainly can be seen as bolstering the dossier’s overall thesis of a Trump-Russia conspiracy, but they can also be seen as undermining Steele’s credibility, as he appears to have missed some genuine significant events. Last but by no means least, the Mueller inquiry has been conducted thus far with a remarkably high degree of secrecy. Nobody had any idea Manafort was about to be indicted until he was indicted, and nobody knows what kind of cooperation Michael Flynn is offering. It certainly might be the case that Mueller could eventually reveal charges along the lines of what’s in the dossier — we wouldn’t know one way or the other — but so far, nothing we’ve seen from the investigation really either confirms or debunks its main arguments. On January 3, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) — a key House conservative — rolled out a tweetstorm asking 18 questions about the FBI and Russia, many of them centering on the dossier. 1) Did the FBI pay Christopher Steele, author of the dossier? Jordan, joined by another leading House conservative, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-SC), has also called for Trump to fire Jeff Sessions so he can put a new attorney general in place who would oversee (and presumably quash) the Russia investigation. This is part of a broader conservative effort to discredit the Mueller investigation, which in turn is part of a broader conservative counternarrative on the whole Russia scandal. The dossier plays a key role in this theory. It’s long been known that Steele shared many of his findings with the FBI before the election. There were also reports that the FBI planned to pay Steele to do more work, and that the dossier’s allegations helped justify the FISA warrant to wiretap former Trump adviser Carter Page. Given the fact that the Clinton campaign and DNC were behind the dossier, some conservatives wondered if in fact the entirety of the Trump/Russia investigation that has embroiled the White House in fact stemmed from Steele’s (bogus, they believe) allegations, used as a pretext by anti-Trump elements of the “deep state” to surveil and entrap people close to him. Back in November, the theory made it to the opinion page of the Wall Street Journal, courtesy of columnist Kim Strassel, who wrote: It is fair to ask if the entire Trump-Russia narrative—which has played a central role in our political discourse for a year, and is now resulting in a special counsel issuing unrelated indictments—is based on nothing more than a political smear document. Is there any reason to believe the FBI was probing a Trump-Russia angle before the dossier? Is there any collusion allegation that doesn’t come in some form from the dossier? Strassel, however, turned out to be wrong. The New York Times reported in December, and the Nunes memo confirmed in February, that the FBI began investigating Trump associates’ ties to Russia for a reason having nothing to do with the dossier. Specifically, they opened the investigation after receiving a tip from the Australian government that George Papadopoulos, after a night of drinking heavily, told Australia’s ambassador to the United Kingdom that he knew Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton. (Papadopoulos has since admitted in a guilty plea that, a few weeks before this, a Russian-connected source had told him that the Kremlin had incriminating emails about Clinton.) The Nunes memo did confirm that the Justice Department partly relied on the Steele Dossier’s information to get a FISA warrant targeting Page in October 2016. But at that point Page had been gone from the Trump campaign for nearly a month. And so far, none of the charges or filings in Mueller’s investigation appear to have anything to do with Page, or from information learned while surveilling him. In the end, the dossier was a major media story a year ago, but should have faded in significance over time as both journalistic and law enforcement inquiries have shed light on a much more solid — but substantially different in detail — version of the Trump-Russia saga. Instead, it’s come to have a second life as Republicans have changed their minds about Trump. Initially, many in Congress viewed the president-elect somewhat warily and, in particular, were concerned on the merits that he might abandon the GOP’s traditionally hawkish posture toward Russia. After a year in office, it’s now clear that whatever did or didn’t happen over the course of the campaign, Trump is not, in fact, going to implement the kind of pro-Russian foreign policy he campaigned on. Consequently, congressional Republicans who once supported the idea of investigating the Trump-Russia nexus have basically flipped around and are now primarily investigating the investigators — with the dossier now serving as an exhibit for the defense rather than the prosecution.

        "articles": "\"Inequality brings out the worst in us.\" In the early 1990s, one of Florida's most populous counties had a problem. So many uninsured residents were using the public hospital that it was costing the county more and more money. But unlike other communities suffering the same fate, Hillsborough County had a unique solution. Local leaders were able to pass a half-cent sales tax increase to give health care services to about 30,000 uninsured residents. And 25 years later, the program is still going strong. So health care advocates tried to bring this policy to other communities. But they kept running into similar problems: People with insurance didn't see it as priority to use public funds to create a safety net for their less privileged neighbors. This is a tension that exists in many local governments. But when Obamacare was passed, it lifted some of this burden. Sure, it was billed as a policy that would make individual people healthier — and it ended up insuring 20 million people. But it also made neighborhoods healthier. It meant communities no longer had to fight over local tax dollars to care for the uninsured. It also meant there were fewer uninsured people who felt cast out and dehumanized by their communities. It lifted up our poorest and most vulnerable neighbors. So when Republicans talk about repealing Obamacare, they promise to replace it with something better — and much of the talk is about individual health and cost, even though both the House and Senate plans would insure fewer people and shift the burden disproportionately to the poor and sick. But it’s not just a uniquely “personal” issue, as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said at a debate on Obamacare a few months ago. It’s not just about individual bodies, though it may seem that way. Rather, health care is so personal and the stakes are so high that it affects the way we view our community — and the way we view our neighbors. Research shows that high rates of uninsurance tears at the fabric of a neighborhood. It makes the uninsured feel dehumanized; it makes residents feel like their neighbors are less trustworthy and benevolent. Instead of blurring the differences between people we see on a daily basis, it brightens them. And some research even suggests that as we're exposed to these signs of impoverished people in our communities, we become less willing to help them. We become less generous. Last year, Vanderbilt University researcher Tara McKay looked at about 2,000 families in Los Angeles who had responded to neighborhood surveys in the early and mid-2000s. The survey asked five questions on how cohesive they felt their neighborhood was: Then McKay analyzed how people's answers differed based on the percentage of uninsured people in their neighborhood, after controlling for other factors that might affect these answers. She found that rates of uninsurance were one of the best predictors of how cohesive a neighborhood was, and that overall, a higher rate of uninsurance tended to make a neighborhood less cohesive. These surveys, conducted in 2001 and 2007, were from before Obamacare. But how did neighborhood cohesion levels change with Obamacare? The researchers projected the effect; the dotted purple line below hints at what likely happened when Obamacare was signed into law in 2010: In other words, the way we feel about our neighbors is heavily influenced by whether or not people in the community have the means to get medical care. \"We've been talking about this as a health policy,\" McKay told me, \"but, really, there are these social and economic consequences.\" Even in Hillsborough County, which is the gold standard for local health care programs, not everyone was happy about raising taxes to give social services to the poor. Early on, two wealthy businessmen led a fight that argued the county was giving out \"free health insurance\" — and that this \"misguided public generosity\" would attract uninsured people from around the country. (It didn’t.) But this tension between the haves and have-nots makes perfect sense in communities with high levels of inequality. It means not only that people have different desires of how they want to spend public funds but also that people have a very different expectation of life — and even the longevity of life. A recent study led by Stanford University researcher Raj Chetty found that in some communities, the difference in life expectancy between the poorest residents and the richest residents is almost 10 years. You can see what the disparity looks like in your county by using this tool below: While this doesn't look at who is insured or uninsured, it shows that these stratified communities have to make decisions about the mortality of their residents. If Obamacare is repealed and replaced with something that lowers the safety nets, that disparity will only rise. This has a larger impact on our cohesion levels in local communities than it does on our cohesion levels in larger geographies, like counties or states. We see this in McKay's research, where she looks at whether high uninsurance levels at a county level have an impact on how we feel about our neighbors. What she finds is that it isn't nearly as strong as when we're exposed to inequality in our neighborhoods. But this is also about how health care providers react to uninsured people. \"They close emergency rooms or relocate emergency rooms out of places where they're exposed to uninsured,” McKay says. She also cites research that shows providers in these areas offer lower-quality care. This means concentrated communities of uninsurance not only lack the means to pay for care, but they also lack access to it. “It shapes the way they see the community,\" McKay says. They start thinking about who the community values and internalize that. This is especially true of immigrant communities, which are more vulnerable to falling through the cracks. In 2012, researcher Taewoo Kim wanted to understand why Korean immigrants were one of the least insured communities in the country. So he conducted in-depth interviews with 48 first-generation Korean Americans with legal status. What he found was devastating. Korean Americans were often small-business owners surviving on tight margins and extremely long hours. They experienced high levels of physical and emotional stress, but they felt the American health care system — especially its payment system — was largely inaccessible to them. The researchers found that within the community, there were \"widely circulated stories of financially devastating medical bills” that made health care institutions unreachable for Korean Americans. Almost half of those interviewed did not have insurance. For a period of my childhood, this was my family; we owned a dry cleaning business, then a car stereo shop, then a vending machine business. My parents worked extremely long hours, much of it physical labor, with barely a moment to care for their own deteriorating bodies. One 54-year-old man, who had spent more than half his life in the US, framed our mindset perfectly in Kim’s study. He told the researchers: There is no such a thing as check-up for us. The hospital is a place where we go when we feel pain, isn’t it? If I have health insurance, it would be a different matter. But even the American insurance system is not good. American insurance often has a one thousand or two thousand deductible. Who would buy it? It’s too expensive. Obamacare is ultimately a redistributive policy, so closes the inequality gap between haves and have-nots. So when it’s taken away, it’s likely to accelerate the rise of inequality: Either directly or indirectly, this means we’re brightening the lines between the haves and the have-nots. This means more people are exposed to inequality on a daily basis — and the question then is: How does this affect our thinking? It’s something Harvard University researcher Melissa Sands often wondered when she lived in New York City and rode subways filled with people from varying ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. So last winter, she devised an experiment to test this out. She and her research assistants set out to the streets of two affluent Boston neighborhoods and posed as petitioners. Then they asked every third person to sign one of two petitions: to increase a tax on millionaires, or to reduce the use of plastic bags. But within 20 feet of this interaction, Sands had an actor pose as either an affluent person or a poor person, denoted by clothing and actions. (There are several ways researchers have \"operationalized\" exposure to inequality, and this was her way.) The findings are counterintuitive. When people were exposed to inequality, they were less likely to sign the petition increasing the millionaire tax. For the plastic bag petition, people signed it at about the same rate. Also interesting is that the respondents, who were mostly white, were least likely to sign the tax petition when exposed to the poor white actor. Sands said one reason might be that people attributed the black person’s impoverishment to structural racism, but they didn’t believe the poor white actor had any excuse. But this fell in line with other research that shows exposure to inequality makes people less likely to support policies that help marginalized groups. For example, one study showed that ethnic diversity in local government made the entity spend less on social services; another showed that being exposed to Spanish-speaking students on the train made people more anti-immigrant. \"Studies like those and studies like mine point to this idea that there are antisocial effects of inequality,\" Sands told me. \"Inequality brings out the worst in us.\" We often talk about how Obamacare insured 20 million people, but the data showed that it disproportionately helped poor households: And it disproportionately helped nonwhite households that previously had difficulty accessing health care: So it’s easy to cast Obamacare as a policy that was designed to redistribute resources to lower-class Americans. But what this research shows is helping marginalized people helps everyone live in better neighborhoods and be around more cohesive communities. It’s easy to see how health insurance helps individuals, so that’s often where the political fight is. But that means politicians don’t talk about how cutting these safety nets could fracture neighborhoods. They don’t talk about how it forces an already dehumanized population to fight with their neighbors for the means to care for themselves. They don’t talk about how it would brighten the lines between the haves and have-nots — between those who can afford to take care of their bodies and those who can't. Or how exposure to inequality make privileged people hunker down, away from those with damaged bodies.

        "articles": "It was Friday, December 12, when Robin Lunge began worrying that Vermont's single-payer plan was doomed. Lunge, Gov. Peter Shumlin's director of health reform, had spent weeks trying to make the math work for a public health insurance plan that would cover all Vermonters. Since Thanksgiving, she had been sending numbers off to M.I.T. economist Jonathan Gruber (yes, that Jonathan Gruber) and Wakely Consulting, an actuarial firm. The models Gruber was running were meant to project the cost of Vermont's plan under different scenarios. What if the health plan covered 80 percent of the typical Vermonter's health care costs? What about 94 percent? But as the numbers got more concrete — as they closed in on the plan the governor actually wanted — the financial foundation began to crack. Lunge knew by that Friday that the single-payer system Vermont wanted to build would require about $2.5 billion in additional revenue in its first year. In Vermont, this is massive: the state only raises $2.7 billion in taxes a year for every program it funds. Early estimates said that Vermont's single-payer plan might need $1.6 billion in additional funds — a huge lift. But $2.5 billion was impossible. \"It was disappointing to me and my team that we weren’t able to make the numbers work the way that we had hoped,\" Lunge said. Forget Obamacare: Vermont wants to bring single-payer health care to America (April 2014) Lunge and her team worked through the weekend. Saturday and Sunday fell into a sort of rhythm: she would change their assumptions slightly and send the new figures off to Gruber. It took him about 24 hours to run the new figures in that model, which would produce projections for how much the single-payer system would cost. \"I kept running into them at the coffee shop,\" said Deb Richter, a long-time single-payer advocate in Montpelier. \"They looked very tired. They were working their butts off.\" Each new packet of Gruber data was essentially the same as the old Gruber data. It kept showing that a single-payer system would be more costly than initially expected. \"It was really over the weekend that we started to realize this might be too big an obstacle to surmount,\" said Lunge. After the non-stop weekend, Lunge met on Monday, December 15, with Governor Shumlin. He reviewed the weekend's work and delivered his final verdict: he would no longer pursue single-payer. Shumlin's office kept the decision secret until a Wednesday press conference. The audience was shocked — many had turned up thinking that Shumlin would announce his plan to pay for universal coverage, not that he was calling the effort off. \"It was dramatic being in that room,\" Richter said. \"You just saw reporters standing there with their mouths open.\" Over the past three years, Vermont has come closer than any other state in building a publicly financed, universal health care system. I spent time in Vermont this spring talking to the key people trying to make single-payer a reality. I reached out to many of them again this week to understand how it fell apart — and what it means for the future of single-payer health care in America. Vermont’s case for single-payer health care can be summarized in one number: $82,975. That’s the amount a 2011 study in the journal Health Affairs found the average American doctor spends on dealing with insurance companies. Across the border in Ontario, doctors spend about a quarter of that amount — $22,205 per physician — interacting with the province’s single-payer agency. American doctors spend lots of money dealing with insurers because there are thousands of them, each negotiating their own rate with every hospital and doctor. An appendectomy, for example, can cost anywhere from $1,529 to $186,955, depending on how good of a deal an insurer can get from a hospital. The average amount of money spent on health care per person has more than doubled since 1999 in Vermont, from $3,421 per person each year to $7,876 per person each year. The gap between the US's per-person spending and Vermont's per-person spending has decreased. (The Green Mountain Care Board) That doesn’t happen in single-payer systems. When the government owns and operates one health insurance plan for all residents, it sets a single price for each medical procedure. Health providers can take it or leave it —and they typically take it. Think of it as a bulk discount: when the government can promise to deliver loads of patients to a given hospital or doctor, they have leverage to insist on a lower price. Administrative costs tend to be lower, too. Instead of dealing with dozens of insurers who set hundreds of prices, doctors only need to send bills to the federal government. The administrative savings of a single-payer system do come at a price. Single payer requires the government to make difficult decisions about what benefits they will and won’t cover — and often leave out pretty standard medical services, things like prescription drugs or dentist visits. Single-payer systems can vary dramatically from country to country. \"It’s a label that gets applied as if you could put a bunch of countries under it, and they would all look similar,\" said Cathy Schoen, executive director of the Council of Economic Advisors at the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that focuses on health policy research. \"But there actually aren’t very many health-care systems that look the same.\" Some countries, like Canada, own the health insurance plan but contract with private hospitals and doctors. They pay claims in the same way American health insurers do. Others, like the United Kingdom, own the health-care providers themselves. Countries make different decisions about which medical services they’ll cover — and how much they’ll ask citizens to chip in. New Zealand's and Norway’s programs include co-payments for trips to the hospital; Italy's and Denmark's do not. Some plans include prescription drug coverage, while others stick residents with the tab. Overall, single-payer systems tend to be especially good at two things: increasing health coverage rates and holding down health care prices. Getting people covered is, unsurprisingly, a much easier task when the government is running a health insurance plan. When Taiwan implemented a single-payer system in 1995, the insured rate went from 53 percent to 96 percent in nine months. Single-payer countries are often associated with longer wait times, a perception that stems from Canada’s system. One recent Commonwealth Fund survey found 36 percent of Canadians say they wait six days or more to see a doctor when they’re sick, compared to 23 percent of Americans. Long wait times don’t appear to be systemic to single-payer systems, though. Australia and the United Kingdom, for example, have shorter wait times than the United States Worries about rationing and wait times made single payer a polarizing term, even in deep-blue Vermont. It’s often used in attacks on government-financed health care, conjuring up images of long wait times and rationed care. Supporters of single-payer didn't like to use it, instead preferring to discuss universal coverage or publicly financed health care. Shumlin was among the rare few who will use the term liberally, mostly out of convenience. He hadn't found a better term to describe what he wanted to bring to Vermont: a system where a single entity (the state) pays for everyone’s health care. And he didn't care to spend much time thinking up a better description. \"I don’t care what you call it,\" Shumlin told me in March, during a lengthy interview in his office. \"I care that we get it right.\" Vermont wasn’t satisfied with the health reform law that Congress passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act. That law expands health coverage by growing the existing health-care system. Americans who already had health insurance have seen barely any change. Uninsured people have gotten covered through two existing programs: the individual insurance market (where millions of Americans now receive subsidies to help buy coverage) and Medicaid, a public program for low-income people. Shumlin had a different idea. He didn’t want to build on what existed. He wanted to blow up what exists and replace it with one state-owned and operated plan that would cover all of Vermont’s residents — an example he hopes other states could follow. Vermont has long prided itself on leading the nation. It was the first state to abolish slavery in 1777 and, in more recent history, pioneered same-sex civil unions with a 2000 law. Shumlin thought it could be the first state to move to single-payer health care, too. Shumlin surprised local activists by running for governor in 2010 on a single-payer platform. While most Democrats across the country shied away from health care in that election, reassuring angry constituents that they didn’t support a government takeover of health insurance, Shumlin was on TV expressly endorsing that idea. \"It was the first person I ever heard in politics who was a serious candidate, said the words ‘single payer,’ and weren’t using them in an attack ad,\" says Richter, who is the president of Vermont for Single Payer. \"It was amazing.\" Shumlin wanted to move quickly. He worked with Harvard health economist William Hsiao, who has helped many other countries launch single-payer plans. He wrote an outline for Vermont on what their plan could look like (the document is ubiquitous in the statehouse, known simply as the Hsiao report). On May 26, 2011, Vermont passed Act 48, the first law in the nation that provides health coverage to all residents of a state. Act 48 outlined a set of benefits — namely, that all Vermonters would gain access to a public health plan. The law, however, didn't outline how the state would pay for those benefits. Some now reflect back on that as an ominous sign for what would happen next. \"I was skeptical when the original bill passed,\" Peter Galbraith, a Vermont state senator, said. \"When you pass a benefit and don't say how you're going to pay for it, it raises the obvious question of, 'How are you going to pay for it?'\" Putting a price tag on Vermont’s single-payer plan was a maddening task for health economists after Act 48 passed. In just the past two years, different economic modeling firms have priced the project anywhere from $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion during its first year. \"There are so many different factors and you could end up with a gazillion options. When you make choices on some of these things, they all have repercussions in terms of cost,\" Katharine London, a health economist at the University of Massachusetts, told me in March (she declined an interview Wednesday). The Shumlin administration contracted with London and a team of economists at her university last year to estimate the cost of Vermont’s plan. Their report estimated that Vermont will need to raise an additional $1.6 billion in tax revenue in 2017 to pay for a single-payer system. (Lunge says, due to some different assumptions, this report and the new one estimating a $2.5 billion price tag are not completely \"apples to apples\" comparisons). As the 2017 launch date for single-payer grew closer, the Shumlin administration began to dive into the details of how, exactly, it would work — and began to falter. Shumlin had planned to increase Medicaid spending by 3 percent each year from 2012 to 2017. This money was especially important because, for every dollar that Vermont puts towards its Medicaid system, it gets a match of $1.17 from the federal government. But the Vermont economy wasn't growing as quickly as expected — and that meant the state couldn't afford those 3 percent pay bumps. And that, in turn, meant they didn't get the federal funds, either. \"We couldn't provide the investment in Medicaid that we had initially thought we'd depend on,\" Lunge said. Specific policy decisions started to make the program more expensive, too. Shumlin decided recently, after getting input from the business community, that Vermont's program should cover out-of-state commuters who work in the state. It would be too complex, business owners advised, to have to offer something separate to employees who came in from New Hampshire or Massachusetts each day. Covering more people meant spending more money. \"This is a challenge we face as a state setting up a system, rather than an entire country,\" said Lunge. \"We have borders, and people come in across those borders every day.\" The increased costs and decreased revenue started to add up. The Shumlin administration estimated it would need to increase payroll taxes by 11.5 percent and income tax by 9 percent. \"There had been whispers that maybe [the payroll tax increase] would get as high as 8 percent,\" said Al Gobeille, chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, the independent agency overseeing the implementation of universal coverage. When the governor mentioned the 11.5 percent figure at his Wednesday press conference, Gobeille said it was a shock to the business owners in the room. \"They didn't know the tax would be so high,\" he said. \"But then they were relieved, because he said he wouldn't do it.\" About half of countries who attempt to build single-payer systems fail. That’s Harvard health economist William Hsiao’s estimate after working with about 10 governments in the past two decades. Whether he is in Taiwan, Cyprus, or Vermont, the process is roughly the same: meet with legislators, draw up a plan, write legislation. Only half of those bills actually become law. The part where it collapses is, inevitably, when the country has to pay for it. In the United States, the failure rate is even higher. The California legislature has twice passed single-payer legislation, only to have the bills vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. There was also a single-payer ballot measure in California in 1994, but the insurance industry pushed back aggressively against it. And those are relative success stories: activists in Colorado failed to get enough signatures for a single-payer ballot measure this past November. Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has introduced and re-introduced a bill to bring a public plan to the entire country since 2009. It has languished through three consecutive sessions of Congress. In a way, the fact that America hasn’t taken serious steps to control health spending makes it particularly hard for the country to move to a single-payer system in the future. Our health-care system costs $2.8 trillion annually, about 17.7 percent of the entire economy. This is way more than any single-payer system anywhere in the world costs. Take Canada, where 11.2 percent of all spending goes towards medical care. That's the irony of America's health-care system: its incredible failure to control costs makes change that much harder, because so many powerful players profit so handsomely from the status quo, and because rearranging the financing creates so many losers. \"If Vermont was spending 10 percent of its economy on health care, this would be hugely cheaper,\" Schoen at the Commonwealth Fund said. \"But that's not the health care system they're raising funds for.\" Another strike against single-payer systems, compared to other American health-care arrangements: they're financed in an unusually transparent way. And arranging that financing, from scratch, often proves impossible. Right now, most Americans get their health insurance through an employer. That employer, unbeknownst to us, typically puts thousands of dollars into our policy alongside the money we kick in. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, employers, on average, pay more than 80 percent of an individual worker's premiums. But Americans usually don't notice their employer subsidy for health insurance; it doesn't show up on their paycheck anywhere. Or take Obamacare, which is funded partially by taxes on the rich, partially by fees on various players in the medical industry, and partially through cuts to Medicare. The cost is spread across many groups, and many government functions. 8 facts that explain what’s wrong with American health care Everything you need to know about health-care spending 15 charts that show how our health-care prices are insane But by moving all the financing to the government, a single-payer health plan like the one Vermont considered would lay naked the incredible costs of our health care system. Vermonters would certainly notice the 9 percent income tax hike and 11.5 percent payroll tax that the Shumlin administration concluded would be necessary to raise enough funds. What's more, single-payer would not have just changed how Vermont pays for health care — it would have changed who pays, shifting more of the burden onto large companies. Right now, the way workers pay for health insurance is regressive: a private insurance company sets a price for their policy, and a worker who earns $30,000 has to put a bigger share of her paycheck towards buying it than someone who earns $100,000. Single-payer systems often rely on taxes, rather than set premium contributions. And that links the price of health insurance to how much someone earns. The proposed 9 percent income tax, for example, would be far more expensive for that $100,000 worker than the $30,000 earner. That new taxes are unpopular, even in Vermont, is not a surprise. But if Shumlin could have told Vermont businesses, \"You'll pay slightly less than you used to for health care — it'll just be a tax rather than a premium,\" his plan may have just barely squeaked by. But he couldn't: the proposed taxes would ask higher earners to spend more on health care than they do now — in some cases, far more. \"An 11.5 percent tax would look great if I'm a low-wage employer,\" said Schoen. \"But I'm a high-wage employer, 11.5 percent is going to be way higher than what I used to pay to buy insurance.\" \"You'd think that, if there was any state where this could fly politically, it should have been Vermont,\" said Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College. \"But in this case, the price was so big that even a state as solidly blue as Vermont wasn't able to swallow it.\" When I interviewed Shumlin in March, he said that whether or not Vermont succeeded at its single-payer push would have huge national ramifications. Back then, his state had the potential to serve as a model. It could be what Romneycare was in Massachusetts: a template for national reform. But if single-payer couldn't succeed in deep-blue Vermont, Shumlin and others mused, how could it possibly move forward anywhere else? \"If Vermont gets single-payer health care right, which I believe we will, other states will follow,\" he predicted. \"If we screw it up, it will set back this effort for a long time.\" I asked Shumlin's office for an interview Wednesday to discuss what the plan's failure meant.

        "articles": "Congress, not neoliberalism, hamstrung Obama’s presidency. What are we talking about when we talk about neoliberalism? In its simplest form, neoliberalism refers to a general preference for market mechanisms over state interventions. But since almost everyone sometimes prefers market mechanisms to state interventions, and sometimes prefer state interventions to market mechanisms, the conversation quickly gets confusing. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were neoliberals. Bill Clinton is often seen as a neoliberal. Barack Obama is sometimes considered a neoliberal. Elizabeth Warren is occasionally called a neoliberal. A label that can describe everyone doesn’t usefully describe anyone. In recent years, neoliberal has reemerged as political slander, meaning something like “corporatist sellout Democrat.” Kean Birch, author of an intellectual history of neoliberalism, argues that the term has collapsed into incoherence, with too many people using it to describe too many things for the conversation to remain constructive. Jon Chait argues that the word neoliberal has become an all-purpose insult, “an attempt to win an argument with an epithet.” I think we need the term neoliberalism. At its most useful, neoliberalism describes what happens when capitalism mutates from an economic system to a governing and even moral philosophy. That’s a more pervasive and destructive phenomenon than we tend to realize, and the idea of neoliberalism is the closest we have for a word that describes it. But for that reason, I’ve become more frustrated with the lazy ways the term is tossed around — and, particularly, how it becomes an all-purpose explanation for any political outcome someone doesn’t like. Farhad Manjoo’s latest column in the New York Times is an example. Manjoo argues that “Barack Obama’s biggest mistake rhymes with ‘schneo-liberalism.’” But his examples, for the most part, have less to do with Obama administration ideology than congressional vote counting. This is confusion with an agenda. If, say, the stimulus was too small because Obama was a market-fetishizing neoliberal rather than a far-sighted leftist, simply replacing him with a leftist will solve the problem. But that wasn’t the problem. Obama and his administration were market-oriented progressives. They were, and are, well to the right of Bernie Sanders. But they were well to the left of what Congress was willing to pass on literally any day of the Obama presidency. Take Manjoo’s first example: the stimulus. He writes: By the time Obama took office, job losses had accelerated so quickly that his advisers calculated the country would need $1.7 trillion in additional spending to get back to full employment. A handful of advisers favored a very large government stimulus of $1.2 trillion; some outside economists — Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, James Galbraith — also favored going to a trillion. But Obama’s closest advisers declined to push Congress for anything more than $800 billion, which they projected would reduce unemployment to below 8 percent by the 2010 midterms. The argument here took place between Christina Romer, who led Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, and Larry Summers, who directed the National Economic Council. In an early memo presenting various goals for the stimulus, Romer listed, as her shock-and-awe option, a stimulus that would “eliminate the output gap by 2011–Q1,” which she estimated would require a “package costing about $1.8 trillion over two years.” Obama never saw that option. In the final memo Summers crafted, it was deleted as politically impossible. But here’s the thing: Summers and Romer are both, in the popular definition of the term, neoliberals. They’re both economists who believe strongly in markets. Krugman and Stiglitz are also lumped in as neoliberals. Correctly calculating the size of the output gap wasn’t a question that divided neoliberals from leftists. The disagreement was political. Congressional leaders had told the Obama administration that the price tag had to fall under $1 trillion if the package was to have any hope of passing, and the administration listened. You can argue, as a political judgment, that they shouldn’t have listened. But the Obama administration didn’t want a repeat of the TARP experience, where Congress voted down the bill and sent markets reeling. The economy was far weaker by the time Obama took office, and the fear was that another shock would prove catastrophic. They believed, wrongly, that if the downturn deepened and more stimulus was needed, Congress would approve it. “If you’re at the barber and they don’t cut your hair short enough, you can always ask them to go a little further,” Jared Bernstein, a left-leaning economist who served in the Obama administration, told me in 2011. “That’s sort of how I thought about stimulus policy. I don’t think we could have done more in February of 2009 based on political and implementation constraints. But I probably didn’t recognize how hard it would be to go back to the barbershop.” It’s worth remembering that even the $787 billion stimulus barely passed, and the three Republicans who provided the crucial votes insisted on $30 billion in cuts and a substantial shift from direct spending to tax breaks. In 2011, with the recession grinding on, the Obama administration proposed another $447 billion in stimulus but Congress ignored the request. The idea that a $1.8 trillion stimulus was possible is fantasy, and the reason for that was Congress, not neoliberalism. The stimulus isn’t Manjoo’s only example. Take this passage: It is true that Obama succeeded in passing a groundbreaking universal health care law. It’s also true that over the course of his presidency, inequality grew, and Obama did little to stop it. While much of the rest of the country struggled to get by, the wealthy got wealthier and multimillionaires and billionaires achieved greater political and cultural power. In 2013, Obama called inequality “the defining challenge of our time” and proposed a raft of policies for curbing it. Remember the Buffett tax? Or closing the carried-interest loophole? Obama’s 2015 budget included $1.3 trillion in tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, and it intended to spend those funds, in part, on universal pre-k. That budget went nowhere in Congress. The blockage wasn’t a neoliberal ideology that considered soaring inequality just or beneficial. It was Republicans. You can argue, fairly, that the Obama administration’s proposed solutions would not have driven America toward anything even approaching economic equality. I’d agree with that critique, but it doesn’t explain how a yet larger package would’ve had more success in John Boehner’s House. The Affordable Care Act is a more interesting example. Manjoo writes: Obama’s biggest ideas were neoliberal: The Affordable Care Act, his greatest domestic policy achievement, improved access to health care by altering private health-insurance markets. I think it’s correct to see the ACA as a neoliberal approach to expanding health insurance coverage. But the particular reason that Democrats embraced it wasn’t because most of them preferred it to all possible alternatives. I covered that process extensively, and literally no Democrats I spoke to framed the ACA as their ideal policy. But, after decades of watching health reform fail in Congress, Democrats saw Mitt Romney’s reforms succeed in Massachusetts and decided to copy them at the national level in a bid for Republican support. It’s worth remembering that this was the strategy favored by, among others, Sen. Ted Kennedy, who brought John McDonough, who’d worked on the Massachusetts plan, to the Senate as his top health care adviser. The idea that a Romney-style approach would garner Republican votes proved wrong, though the idea that it could pass proved right. Even here, though, the plan was pushed far to the right during congressional negotiations, with Sen. Ben Nelson, among others, killing the public option, and Sen. Joe Lieberman knifing the proposal to expand Medicare to age 55. The Obama administration made plenty of mistakes, some of them purely ideological. They bought into the deficit-hysteria of 2010-2011 in a genuinely damaging way. Their housing policy was weak, and while the politics of housing were much harder than is now remembered — it was the administration’s tepid HARP proposal that led to the Tea Party revolt — the administration should’ve put their back into passing “cramdown” and used more TARP money directly on homeowners. There are places where a left president would’ve differed dramatically from Obama, starting with personnel. A leftist wouldn’t have nominated Timothy Geithner as treasury secretary, kept Ben Bernanke on at the Federal Reserve, or been as personally conciliatory toward Wall Street. Manjoo also mentions deploying antitrust laws to break up Google and Facebook and Amazon, though he admits that he, like virtually everyone else during the Obama era, loudly opposed anything of the kind. But you can’t blame everything on neoliberalism. If the Obama administration had been able to get what it wanted, there would have been far more stimulus, a public option in Obamacare, larger subsidies for health insurance, higher taxes on the rich and corporations, hundreds of billions more in infrastructure investment and social spending, universal pre-k, a cap-and-trade plan to curb climate change, comprehensive immigration reform, and much more. The agenda the Obama administration passed isn’t the agenda it wanted. The agenda the Obama administration passed is the agenda they could pass. It was congressional Republicans (and, sometimes, Democrats), not neoliberalism, that curbed their ambitions. It’d be interesting to compare an idealized neoliberal agenda to an idealized left agenda, but you can’t do that by looking at the few policies that survived the filibuster. Manjoo waves this away. “If he’d been in the mood to press the case, Obama might have found widespread public appetite for the sort of aggressive, interventionist restructuring of the American economy that Franklin D. Roosevelt conjured with the New Deal,” he writes. Even ignoring the actual evidence we have on public opinion, the fact is that FDR entered office years into the Great Depression, and the agony of the suffering swept him in alongside a massive Democratic wave. Unemployment was above 20 percent when Roosevelt took office, rather than 7.8 percent, as was true for Obama. That misery didn’t just hand Roosevelt the White House in 1932, it gave Democrats 313 House seats to the GOP’s 113, and 59 Senate seats to the GOP’s 36. It was those huge congressional majorities, operating in a time of less polarization and far more economic suffering, that made Roosevelt’s agenda possible. That’s not to argue that Obama shared Roosevelt’s outlook or would have mimicked his administration even if he could have. I genuinely have no idea what Obama would’ve done if he took office in the midst of 23 percent unemployment and nearly total control of Congress, just as I don’t know what Roosevelt would’ve done if he took office with 7.8 percent unemployment and slimmer majorities. But the case that the two men’s records were separated primarily by ideology and ambition is thin. Toward the end of his column, Manjoo poses a question. “What’s the point of returning to this history now, a decade later?” he asks. His answer: Think of it as a cautionary tale — a story that ought to rank at the top of mind for a Democratic electorate that is now choosing between Obama’s vice president and progressives like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who had pushed Obama, during the recovery, to adopt policies with more egalitarian economic effects ... not only did Obama’s policy ideas produce lackluster economic results (at least in that they failed to hit their stated goals), they failed politically, too. The sluggish recovery in Obama’s first years led to a huge loss for Democrats in the 2010 midterms. Manjoo has the right idea here and the wrong conclusion. This is a cautionary tale. The results of the Obama administration’s legislative failures were catastrophic in both human and political terms. But replace the Obama administration with a further left administration in Manjoo’s story. What changes, exactly? How would President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren have changed Sen. Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson’s minds on the public option? How would they have gotten the Republican votes they needed in the Senate to support more stimulus spending? These are questions not of neoliberalism versus leftism but of political strategy and institutional constraint. Many on the left are, like Manjoo, loading neoliberalism with a weight it cannot bear. Condemning neoliberalism becomes a way of hiding from the harsh strictures of America’s polarized, paralyzed political process, in which geography and gerrymandering gives Republicans a constant congressional advantage and Fox News spins an alternative reality on the daily. The truth is that Obama-style liberals and Sanders-style leftists face a similar problem: both are well to the left of the median member of Congress, and both want to pass agendas far more ambitious than anything Congress has done in decades. How do they do it? The hard choices here were underscored by another piece the New York Times published on Wednesday, profiling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s efforts to modulate her approach to better fit the constraints of the institution in which she serves: After nearly nine months, with her eyes now wide open to the downsides of her revolutionary reputation and social media fame, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has tempered her brash, institution-be-damned style with something different: a careful political calculus that adheres more closely to the unwritten rules of Washington she once disdained. “I think I have more of a context of what it takes to do this job and survive on a day-to-day basis in a culture that is inherently hostile to people like me,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. Ocasio-Cortez isn’t losing her ideological fire. She’s adapting to the institution that surrounds her. She’d like a policy and political approach well to the left of what exists now. But if she’s going to get anything done, she needs to find ways to work with the members who are already there, members who are to her right ideologically but whose votes are necessary if she’s going to pass anything. There are real differences between neoliberals and leftists, and those debates are healthy to have. But the fundamental constraint on Democratic administrations is not how far left they are, but how far left Congress is. If Bernie Sanders is elected president in 2020 but he’s facing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he’s going to end up passing a more compromised policy agenda than if, say, Michael Bennet wins the presidency and Democrats take back the Senate. That’s not because Bennet is to Sanders’s left, but because it’s Congress, not the president, that writes and passes laws. “Only now, in the age of Sanders and Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are we beginning to relearn the lessons of the past,” writes Manjoo. Unfortunately, I’m not sure we are learning them. If you look back on the Obama administration’s shortcomings and see a purely ideological story, then you’ve missed the political institutions that not only constrained him, but will act with as much or more force against Sanders, Warren, or AOC.

        "articles": "Why the collusion story begins with money, not politics. “To understand the roots of the collusion, set aside Putin and follow the money.” That’s what Seva Gunitsky, a politics professor at the University of Toronto and the author of Aftershocks, told me in a September interview. I reached out to Gunitsky after he posted a short but incisive thread on Twitter about the financial roots of the Trump-Russia collusion case. Gunitsky, who was raised in Russia, has followed the evolving relationship between Donald Trump and Russia for more than a decade. He says the prevailing narrative about Putin interfering in the American election in order to undermine democracy is wildly overstated. Putin is happy to sow confusion and distrust in America’s system, of course, but to assume that’s the basis of this operation is to overlook a much simpler motive: money. The financial connections between Trump and various Russian banks and oligarchs (business elites with ties to the Kremlin) stretch back decades, which is likely a big reason why Trump won’t release his tax returns. Trump’s election, Gunitsky contends, presented Russian oligarchs with an opportunity to recoup losses and leverage Trump’s debts for political gain. I asked Gunitsky to lay it out for me as clearly as possible, and to explain the financial dealings between Trump and his Russian business partners. Here’s what he told me. This collusion story gets more convoluted by the day. But you seem to think it’s pretty straightforward. I think it's justifiable for you to say that it seems impossibly convoluted, but I would say it's still much simpler than this idea that there's a global conspiracy designed to bring down democracy. I'm not saying the political dimension is unimportant — surely it is. But if we're talking about the roots of the collusion, we have to look at where Trump's links with Russia begin. And it begins with money. [These roots] don't start with the election; they start with money, and namely Russian oligarch money. So walk me through the trail. Where does the money lead? Again, this doesn't start with the election; it starts with Russian oligarch money pouring into Trump's real estate and casino businesses. Many of them Trump has been working with for years, well before he developed any serious political ambitions. And we’re not talking about small change here; we’re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. Possibly even enough to keep Trump out of another bankruptcy. And we know this how, exactly? We know because they’ve told us. We can talk about specific cases in a minute, but Donald Trump Jr. has already admitted the importance of Russian money to their business ventures. He said publicly in 2008 that \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\" It doesn’t get much clearer than that. And this is why you think Western media has overplayed the centrality of Putin in all of this? We have this notion of Putin as a kind of master strategist playing 10-dimensional chess with Trump. I think it’s obvious that once Putin saw an opportunity he took it, but these financial ties go back a long way, long before the 2016 election. I think that’s right. Putin is often put up as this sort of central antagonist, but the Russian government is not this shadowy monolith. It's sometimes portrayed this way in the West, but in reality the Russian government is messy and disorganized and ad hoc. It's possible that Putin was not even fully aware of efforts to court Trump up until last year, or a couple years ago. Putin, we often forget, has supporters to keep happy as well, people who desperately want to open up those channels of Russian finance. We know there are deep links between Russian money and Trump, but let’s talk about how the interests intertwine. What did you make of the recent revelations about Trump Jr.’s meeting with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya? So we have this infamous Russian lawyer who met with Trump Jr. last year and apparently several other people, including a former Soviet counterintelligence officer. I think the tough question critics have been asking is where is the quid pro quo in that? The Magnitsky Act, ostensibly the purpose of the meeting, isn’t going anywhere, so people are concluding that there wasn’t a quid pro quo here. But we should be talking a lot more about the Prevezon case. Explain what that is and why it matters. So Prevezon is a holding company with links to Russian elites that has been accused of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars through New York City real estate. It's also part of Hermitage Capital, an investment fund that was being investigated by Magnitsky (the Russian lawyer who was killed in a Moscow prison in 2009) more than 10 years ago. Prevezon was part of this giant tax fraud scheme that Magnitsky uncovered in 2008, which led to his death and which led indirectly to the Magnitsky Act of 2012. The U.S. Attorney’s Office was also preparing a massive case against Prevezon last year. Until it was abruptly dropped. We’ll circle back to the case being dropped in a second, but let’s stick to the role of the Russian lawyer that Trump Jr. met with. Now, Prevezon’s lawyer was Natalia Veselnitskaya, who of course met with Trump Jr. last year. She had been pushing for a long time to get something done about the Prevezon case. So it's very possible that she went into that meeting essentially asking for help, in return for which she would give the Trump campaign dirt on Hillary and the DNC. It’s impossible to know for sure what happened in that room, but these are extremely plausible interpretations. It’s hard to say what the groups’ motivations were. These motivations are all entangled — I want to stress that. I don’t want to insist that this was all about the money. I’m only saying that the financial motivations in all of this have been understated in relation to its importance. So what happened with the Prevezon case? Several months after Trump takes office, the Prevezon case is dismissed. So what happened? The U.S. attorney was carefully preparing a case against Prevezon Holdings. They were all set to go forward, and then suddenly the case was settled. Prevezon's own lawyers were kind of shocked. We know they paid something like $6 million, which is a fraction of what the lawsuit was about. So they were extremely happy about it. Congressional Democrats have openly expressed concerns about what happened here. They want to know why it was settled so quickly. Was pressure being applied from above? In any case, we can see the possible motivations of the people approaching Trump for favors. When I say the collusion starts with financial interests, this is what I mean. It’s not that obstructing democracy wasn’t important; it’s that it was potentially a happy byproduct of these financial relationships. And I think for Trump it was always about the money. It's just that now he's undergoing a level of scrutiny that he’s never experienced before. Do we have any evidence that Trump was involved in any way with Prevezon? We don't know that Trump was involved in any way with that. Obviously, it's kind of his wheelhouse, New York City real estate, so I am sure he at least heard about it. But we don't know if he has any direct connections. But it's not even necessary for him to have any direct connections here. They're only asking for some relief in this case, in return for certain compromising documents. So the interesting thing for me is, was there pressure placed on the U.S. Attorney's Office by the administration, by the Department of Justice? What we know is that Preet Bharara, the attorney in charge of the case, was fired in early March, and shortly thereafter the Prevezon case was dropped. And we still have no explanation about this? Not as a far as I know. They had been ready to prosecute, witnesses were flown in, it was all set to go, and it was settled rather unexpectedly. So I think this is a case that hasn't really entered the public consciousness yet. But I'm sure that [special counsel Robert] Mueller's team is looking at it. [Author’s note: Foreign Policy published a detailed report about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s possible role in dismissing the Prevezon case.] Do we know of any public reactions to the dismissal of the Prevezon case from the Russian lawyer or from anyone else associated with this? Veselnitskaya was ecstatic about the Prevezon case on her social media. She said it was \"settled on Russian terms\"; that's a direct quote. She said it was the beginning of the end of the Cold War, and she said there'd be more to come. Again, like so much of the evidence here, this doesn’t prove anything definitively. But there’s an unbelievable amount of smoke, and a massive web of overlapping interests. As hard as it is to make sense of all this, it does help to explain Trump’s unusual consistency on all things Russia. This is a guy without a fixed ideological core, but his bizarre pro-Russia posture is arguably the only issue on which he’s been consistent. I’d only slightly disagree here and say the thing about which he’s been most consistent is the desire to make money. And if we take that, then his consistency on Russia becomes much more sensible. I think you're absolutely right that he has no strong ideological commitments. We've seen that painfully over and over during the last few months. But if his financial interests are tied up with Russian oligarchs, who in turn are tied up with the Kremlin and thus have parallel interests, then Trump’s “consistency” becomes much more explainable. And if we emphasize this financial angle a bit more, it also makes a lot of sense that he would not want to release his tax returns. Because that would expose just how deeply embedded he is with Russian money. To be clear about what you’re saying, you’re not denying the political motivations of Putin or the Kremlin. In your mind, this is about understanding what catalyzed the alleged collusion process, right? That’s right. I think the idea of parallel interest is key here, that the Russian intelligence service, once they saw what Trump was doing, quickly latched on in order to push their own agenda, which was very similar to the Russian oligarchy agenda. And it's hard to even separate the two because, as you probably know, in Russia the distinction between political power and economic power is very fuzzy. Looking at the timeline here helps to clarify your broader argument. It’s not like the Russians foresaw back in 1987, when they first started dealing with Trump, that he might become president in 2017. It seems clear enough that the financial ties were already there, and when the opportunity presented itself, the Kremlin took full advantage of it. Absolutely. There’s a tendency here, in part because of our Cold War inertia, to see Putin as this creature with his tentacles in every part of the country. And I think that may be overstating the case just a bit. He's been in power for 17 years, the people who support him are starting to itch a little bit, and he has to keep them happy. They're not happy about sanctions; they're not happy about restrictions on their financial dealings. If they have financial leverage over Trump, and they clearly do, then why wouldn’t they want him to become president of the United States?

        "articles": "Anne Applebaum wrote the book on why people choose to collaborate with authoritarian regimes. So what does she think of the GOP? If you buy something from a  link,  Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The most alarming aspect of the past week is not Donald Trump’s anti-democratic efforts. He is doing exactly what he has always done, exactly what he said he would do. It’s the speed at which Republican elites have consolidated support around him. Without the Republican Party’s support, Trump is just the loser of an election, ranting ineffectually about theft as a way to rationalize defeat. With the Republican Party’s support, he’s a danger to the country. Some Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, have wholeheartedly endorsed Trump’s claims. On Monday, the South Carolina senator said that Trump should not concede the election and that “Republicans win because of our ideas and we lose elections because [Democrats] cheat.” Others — including Vice President Mike Pence and Sens. Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley — have signaled solidarity with the president, while not quite endorsing his conspiracy theories. The message is clear: When faced with the choice of loyalty to Trump and the legitimacy of the democratic process, Republicans are more than willing to throw democracy under the bus. Anne Applebaum is a staff writer for the Atlantic, a senior fellow of international affairs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and most recently the author of Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism. In it, Applebaum, once comfortable in center-right elite circles, grapples with why so many of her contemporaries across the globe — including right here in America — have abandoned liberal democracy in favor of strongman cults and autocratic regimes. We discuss why most politicians under increasingly autocratic regimes choose to collaborate with the regime, how Graham went from outspoken Trump critic to one of Trump’s most vocal supporters in the US Senate, why the Republican Party ultimately took the path of Sarah Palin, what we can expect to happen if and when a much more capable demagogue emerges, and much more.

How do you think we would cover what Trump and the Republican Party are doing and saying right now if it were happening in another country? If this were happening in another country, we would be talking about a populist authoritarian seeking to create disillusion with democracy in his country in order to have a base of supporters who will help him return to power. But I don’t think we have to talk about it as if it were another country. I’m very happy to use the same language that I would use if this were happening in Brazil or Argentina or anywhere else. I think that Americans — and I would include myself in this — have had an implicit exceptionalism in the way we understood our country’s immunity to some of the political trends and dangers that afflict other countries. As if authoritarianism can’t happen here, as if our parties can’t turn against democracy here. That just no longer seems true. Is it time for Americans to be disabused of the idea that there is any special protection to our system, our political culture? This is a conclusion that I came to several years ago through the agonizing personal experience of living in Poland and watching one of the political parties here become a populist authoritarian party. Watching it try to undermine democracy, undermine the courts, undermine the media once it came to power. And then, glancing over at the United States and realizing that I was seeing many of the same things. I think you’re absolutely right. I think it’s partly American exceptionalism. It’s also partly our incredible luck over the past six or seven decades. We had a stable democracy, we had an expansion of prosperity, we were the leading country in the world, and others were following us. And we somehow came to assume that it was always going to be like that — just because it had been like that for 60 or 70 years, it would go on indefinitely. We forget that even in our own history, we had previous moments when democracy was in doubt. We had a civil war. And even if you look at our own Constitution, it was written by people who also had doubts about democracy and also wondered whether it would succeed. One of the reasons we have some of the odd institutions that we do is that the Founding Fathers were people who had doubts about human nature, who wanted checks and balances, who wanted some control over the president, who were reading Greek and Roman history where there were lots of stories of democracy going wrong. All of that was coded into the system from the very beginning. I think that the last several decades have blinded us to our own history and our own origins. Related I want to put my cards on the table for a moment: I don’t find Donald Trump very interesting in this story. I think what he is is known. He’s a very familiar type historically. What I am interested in is how quickly the Republican Party has fallen to somebody like Trump. The architecture of your book is about watching people you admired and respected — people who fought alongside you against tyrannies and strongmen for liberal democracy — become functionaries in populist-right, authoritarian parties, and often authoritarians themselves. Why do you think that happens? What separates the people who end up as dissidents in those moments from those who become functionaries in them or accommodate themselves to them? I’ve tried to stay away from sweeping vast generalizations. But there is one sentiment, I think, that links the people who were once part of the center-right — the anti-communist movement in Poland or Reaganism or Thatcherism — and who began to change in a different direction over the past decade or so: disappointment. These are very often people who are disappointed, and they are almost always disappointed with their society. Whether it’s the superficiality of modern democracy, the demographic change that they don’t want or like, the decline in morals and values that they see all around them, or, in the case of Britain, England’s loss of its voice in the world. It’s a feeling of loss or disappointment, and sometimes it’s quite an extreme form of disappointment — a kind of despair. “My society has ended.” I think anybody who has that view of the contemporary world — that it’s over, it’s finished, my civilization is dead and gone, my society is decayed — leads you almost inevitably into a kind of radicalism. If you have that feeling that it’s over, then why wouldn’t you try to smash everything? Related As a very quick typology of the Republican Party, I think you could cut people into three groups. There are the people who liked Donald Trump from the beginning, or bought into an apocalyptic understanding of America that Donald Trump seemed to share. A good example is Patrick Buchanan. Then there are people who don’t have unbelievably strong feelings about Donald Trump, but they really hate the left. They’re the anti-anti-Trumpers. And their dislike for the left is enough to make them make peace with him. I would probably put Mitch McConnell in this category. But the people I’m most interested in are the people who saw exactly what Donald Trump is and loathed it and then also accommodated it. Somebody I want to use here as a case study, because you’ve written about him and I’ve spent some time reporting about him, is Lindsey Graham. He ran against Donald Trump in 2016 and called him “a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.” And he said, “if we nominate Trump, we’ll get destroyed, and we’ll deserve it.” Now, he’s out there telling Trump not to concede the election. He’s saying that if Republicans concede, they’ll never win again. He’s telling Sean Hannity that Democrats only win elections when they cheat. What do you think happened to Lindsey Graham? Lindsey Graham is particularly difficult to explain when you look at his background. If you were to look at him as a type, you would imagine him to be the most loyal American patriot and admirer of the Constitution. He has a very strong affiliation to the military. He got through college on a military scholarship. His parents died when he was young, so he had a hard-knock story and was saved by the American military. And he’s said that many times. If you were to imagine a type of person who would never betray American ideals, it would be Lindsey Graham. But this is where you have to get into questions of personality and personal weakness. Graham is clearly someone who needs to be around a leader. For many, many years, he was John McCain’s sidekick. And in those years, he was a McCain Republican. I saw him at conferences in Europe where he talked about America’s role in the world, America promoting democracy. And then when McCain died, he seemed to need another role and he attached himself to Trump. He appears to like the role of a power broker. When he runs into journalists in Washington, he likes recounting how he was just on the phone with the president. So the feeling of being close to power, of being next to someone important, this seems like a role that he is psychologically attached to playing. It’s a recognizable personality type. If you look at the story of other nations that have been occupied by others or where people are part of political systems that they don’t admire, you will always find people like Lindsey Graham who give up their ideas, who move close to power, and who then seek to play some kind of role in the new system benefiting them. My understanding of Graham — and I spent a bit of time with him over the years — is that in the middle of the Trump era, as he began to make this transition, his explanation was if he flattered Trump enough, he could direct Trump in important ways on things that are important to him, particularly foreign policy. This ends up failing. The abandonment of the Kurds, for instance, was a huge blow to Graham. But he does try to become this adviser to Trump, and from what I understand, there was a certain level of realpolitik about that. And then slowly it became something other than that. He began to look at things through new eyes. He was very radicalized by the Kavanaugh [Supreme Court] hearings. He’s out there telling people that the thing about the left is they hate us. All the smart people out there, they hate us. Something that you emphasize in the book is the way that cooperating with a regime like this often is a product not of one big decision to change sides, but of a series of small decisions, a series of small accommodations. And eventually you wake up and you’re on the other side. Can you talk a little bit about that process? There’s actually social science studies of this and usually it’s done in the form of examining corruption inside companies. How do people end up going along with corruption if their company is carrying out some kind of scam? The studies show that it’s always a step-by-step process. You accept one aspect of it: “Well, everybody else is keeping double books, so I can, too. That’s just what people do in this company, and it’s normal.” And then the next step is: “I’ll do this transaction in cash and I’ll keep it in the drawer. And I’m still a good person; I’m still a good worker. I’m doing this to help my company stay out of trouble or keep its head above water.” As each step becomes normalized, as people get used to the situation, then they can take the next step. This is very similar to what happens in occupied countries. I’m not saying that the United States is Vichy France or occupied East Germany. But these are useful parallels to look at because they show you what human psychology is like when someone is working inside a system whose ideology they previously disagreed with or disliked. You see the same kinds of patterns. Something like that also happened inside the Republican Party: People who thought of themselves as patriots, as good people — as politicians working in the interest of the United States — made small decisions over time, each time reminding themselves of why what they were doing was for the good of the country. For Lindsey Graham, it was: I’m here to guide Donald Trump in the right direction. And then, at each stage, the situation becomes normalized. Eventually Lindsey Graham came to see his opponents as anti-American radical leftist socialists who he had to fight against. He still probably thinks he’s playing the same role — that he’s a good person fighting for American values — even though what he’s doing is almost precisely the opposite of what he said he would do or the kind of person that he was four years ago. I want to talk about one of those decision trees that I think is happening right now, which has to do with the stolen election narrative that is taking hold among the Republican base. Donald Trump is simply saying outright, in all caps, that he won the election and that the election has been stolen. There are some Republicans, like Graham, who are siding with him explicitly on that. But many of the others are doing something that I would describe as signaling emotional solidarity with Trump’s claims while not quite buying into them but not disputing them either. On Saturday, Marco Rubio tweeted, “The media can project an election winner, but they don’t get to decide if claims of broken election laws & irregularities are true. That is decided by the courts and on the basis of clear evidence and the law.” The media can project an election winner, but they don’t get to decide if claims of broken election laws & irregularities are true That’s decided by the courts, and on the basis of clear evidence and the law I agree with everything in that tweet. But the point of that tweet is to signal solidarity with a president saying something quite different. I think there is a belief among many elected Republicans right now that their base needs to grieve the election, that Donald Trump needs to grieve the election, and so it’s best to indulge the idea that it might have been stolen. Let them process the law slowly, let the courts shut that down, and then you can move on in a less emotionally traumatic way for your base. I just don’t think they’re going to be able to control it in that way. I think this is going to overtake them just like all the other conspiracies have overtaken them. But I’m curious, do you have sympathy for that view? Is there something to be said for that strategy? I’m afraid that I think it’s a little bit more sinister than that. I think that — certainly on Trump’s part, and other Republicans are probably coming to see this the same way as well — this is an attempt to create a new kind of base: an enraged receiving base, which will always think that the election was stolen and which will always assume that something went wrong and will always feel that they were deprived of something. And this base will then have uses in the future. I don’t believe it will be all of the Republican Party. I can’t tell you right now how many of them it will be. But it will be a significant number of people. And in some congressional districts and some states, it could even be a majority. And this will be a base that is usable. This will be a base that not only dislikes the Democratic Party or disagrees with them, it will think that the Democratic Party is evil and anti-democratic — that they have stolen the election. Think about what that means. That means that they aren’t even a legitimate political party. It means that there is a base of people who will be not just skeptical of mainstream media — whatever you think mainstream media is, which may even include Fox now. They will be not just skeptical of Fox, CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, and the Philadelphia Inquirer. They will think all of those institutions are part of a deliberately constructed conspiracy to steal the presidency. And that kind of feeling — that conviction that the other side isn’t just wrong, it’s evil and traitorous — that’s then a useful group of people who can be motivated politically and maybe in other ways in the future.

        "articles": "There are moments when this president does not disguise his disdain for certain critics, and his meeting last week with a handful of journalists, to discuss the Iran nuclear deal, was one of those moments. He was engaged throughout the conversation, particularly when digging into finer-grain foreign policy. But he maintained his well-known demeanor of cool detachment on all but two subjects: the prospect of war, which clearly tormented him (more on that here), and much of the criticism of the deal, which got him pretty agitated. \"The fantasy, the naiveté, the optimism, is to think that we reject this deal and somehow it all solves itself with a couple of missile strikes — that is not sound foreign policy,\" he said at one point of such critics. But he made a distinction that seemed, to me, to reveal how he thinks about opposition to the Iran deal. He seemed to see opposition as coming from one of two places: people who cynically oppose the nuclear deal because what they in fact want is to launch military strikes, and people who earnestly fear the deal because they do not understand it. What seemed to provoke not just angry retorts from Obama but what appeared, to me, to be actual anger was when he discussed groups or individuals whom he saw as cynically exploiting that fear and uncertainty to steer people into opposing the deal. This, to me, seemed to suggest a great deal about how Obama sees both the nuclear deal itself and the political task before him, of getting that deal past Congress. Some of the opposition, Obama told us, \"has to do with the fact that the average layperson who is not steeped in this stuff and is just reading that Israel is opposed, and knows what the supreme leader said about Israel, is naturally inclined to lean 'no' more than 'yes.'\" While Obama believes the nuclear deal does address all this, he acknowledged that it was complicated. \"If they’re not sitting down with me for an hour, or [Secretary of State] John Kerry or [Secretary of Energy] Ernie Moniz for an hour, it’s hard to absorb all that,\" he said. But Obama seems to see a lot of opposition as cynical as well. You could hear this when he was asked about his assertion that the only viable alternative to the Iran deal is war. In responding, he turned the question back on Iran deal critics, who say that there are peaceful alternatives to the nuclear deal and that Obama is \"fearmongering.\" \"Some of those same people just a while back were arguing that we should just go ahead and take a strike and it would be okay,\" he said. This, for Obama, was a sign of fundamental dishonesty. \"And now suddenly, because maybe that’s not the most popular position to garner votes from Democrats in Congress, they’re insisting no, no, no, no, no — that’s not necessary; we can just apply more sanctions. So there’s a little bit of this that’s not on the level,\" he said, growing visibly frustrated. It was interesting to see the way Obama connected what he sees as these two strands of criticism, as he did in talking about the opposition to the deal from pro-Israel and Jewish groups. At one point, he got a question about why a number of Jewish groups oppose the Iran nuclear deal. While he noted that some Jewish groups do support the deal, and that polling shows that most American Jews support it, he accepted the premise of the question. \"The anxieties of the American Jewish community are entirely understandable,\" he said. \"Those are amplified when there appears to be across-the-board opposition inside of Israel, not just within Likud, but among other parties.\" \"And some of that is emotional in a legitimate way,\" he went on. \"You don’t like dealing with somebody who denies horrible things happening to your people or threatens future horrible things to your people. Some of it is based on legitimate concerns about what a economically stronger Iran could do to further enhance their support of Hezbollah.\" But while he accepted this opposition as emotionally understandable, he still rejected the criticisms as substantially unfounded, and seemed to suggest that this fear and anxiety was being stirred up by people who oppose the deal. \"But I will say this: When I sit down with a group of Jewish leaders, just as when I sit down with members of Congress, just as when I sit down with policy analysts, I do not hear back credible arguments on the other side. I hear talking points that have been prepared,\" he said. \"But if you dig deep into it, the anxieties are real, they’re legitimate, but arguments that would carry the day as to why we wouldn’t do this deal, I haven’t heard presented in a way that I think persuades the room, much less persuades me.\" From there, Obama recounted a well-known story about his administration's dealings with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which has devoted tremendous resources to lobbying Congress to kill the deal. He said he'd had three senior administration officials give AIPAC a presentation on the nuclear deal. Those officials — Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman, and Treasury Department Sanctions Chief Adam Szubin — cleared they day, he said, to talk to AIPAC, but were given only 30 minutes to give a brief presentation. The administration officials \"were prepared to stay there as long as AIPAC wanted, to answer every single question that might be presented in the crowd, and AIPAC declined the offer to ask questions.\" The message Obama clearly wanted us to take away was that AIPAC was limiting his administration's ability to speak to the group's members because they did not actually want their members to learn about the deal and come to their own conclusion. \"My working assumption is that a number of those people who had flown in and, rightly, feel passionate about this issue would have benefited from hearing directly from Wendy Sherman, and that they would have, perhaps, had a different view of this deal,\" he said. \"They would have benefited from hearing directly from Adam Szubin about how sanctions work and why it’s not credible to think that simply doubling down on unilateral sanctions would bring about a so-called better deal.\" I asked AIPAC about this: A spokesperson said that the group did limit the administration officials to only 30 minutes, and that AIPAC members were not able to ask questions. But the spokesperson blamed the White House for this, saying the officials knew beforehand they would only have 30 minutes and took up all of that time with their presentation. The assumption embedded in Obama's comments is that anyone who has taken the time to fully and earnestly understand the nuclear deal will come out supporting it. People only oppose it, he seemed to believe, for one of three reasons: 1) they have a cynical ulterior motive, 2) they have been misled by people with a cynical ulterior motive, or 3) they do not wish to side against the Israeli leadership. Obama made that third point more explicit in a Thursday interview with Mic, when he said, \"There are going to be some Democrats who end up opposing this deal, partly because as I said yesterday in the speech, the affinity that we all feel towards the state of Israel is profound, it's deep. And you know when Israel is opposed to something a lot of Democrats, as well as Republicans, pay attention.\" That may have been a subtle nod to Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who only a few hours later announced that he was going to vote against the nuclear deal. Yes, it's hardly surprising that a president would frame his signature foreign policy effort as good and its critics as bad. But all of this seems to add up to a level of confidence in the deal, and an earnestly held reading of its critics as necessarily wrong, that goes beyond that political necessity. Whether you see Obama's confidence here as an encouraging sign of his faith in the deal or as a discouraging indication of his intolerance for criticism probably depends on your preexisting opinions about Obama and about the Iran deal. But what really matters right now is not so much my reaction or your reaction to Obama's temperament, but the reactions of a few dozens congressional Democrats who have not announced whether they will support or oppose the measure to kill the Iran deal.

Prisoners in 17 states began a three-week strike this week, with many refusing to eat or work to protest what they consider “modern-day slavery” in America’s correctional facilities. Among other demands, prisoners want to earn more than a few dimes for each hour of work that they do, considering that their work brings in billions of dollars in revenue to state and federal prisons. Most inmates across the country do skilled and unskilled labor typically for less than a dollar per hour. (In some states, it’s entirely unpaid.) The work ranges from building office furniture to answering customer service calls to video production and farm work — sometimes without the guarantee of safe work conditions. Prisoners and human rights activists say this dynamic is a form of exploitation and disproportionately harms people of color, who are more likely to be incarcerated in the first place. But correctional facilities argue that prison laborers learn real-life job skills while offsetting some of the costs of running a prison. There is truth to both arguments. But perhaps the most problematic element of prison labor is the twisted market incentive it creates. Because prison labor is so cheap, federal and state governments can sell prison-made goods and services to private companies at rock-bottom prices, creating a labor-market incentive for mass incarceration. Just take a look at how the federal government markets its prisoner workforce to the private sector. In marketing brochures, the Department of Justice touts its “cost-effective labor pool” and a workforce with “Native English and Spanish language skills.” About 17,000 inmates at federal prisons work at more than 50 government factories, farms, and call centers across the country, according to the latest annual report published by the DOJ program Federal Prison Industries, also known as Unicor. Prisoners make air filters, clothes, lamps, and office supplies for wages that range from 23 cents an hour to $1.15 an hour. Most of Unicor’s customers are other federal agencies, but the program also sells millions of dollars’ worth of goods and services to private companies that can’t find workers or plan to outsource jobs overseas. In the first half of fiscal year 2018, Unicor recorded about $300 million in total government and private-sector sales, according to the program’s midyear sales report. Unicor is expanding prison labor to the private sector, according to its annual report, as sales to federal customers are expected to shrink along with cuts to the federal budget. (The Department of Justice did not respond to a request from  for more details about those business partnerships.) Here are a three unsettling examples of how the federal government markets prison labor to US companies: The federal government wants businesses to know that its call centers, staffed by prisoners, are one of the “best-kept secrets” out there. The marketing brochure published by Federal Prison Industries shows smiling inmates wearing headsets as they handle calls from customers: The big sell for this service, according to the brochure, is that companies can avoid outsourcing their customer service departments to an international company to save money, because it’s just as cheap to hire American prisoners to take calls. That’s how one unnamed CEO described the benefit of working with Unicor, according to a customer testimonial in the marketing brochure. “We would receive services from an onshore agent — a US citizen — but at offshore prices. It’s a win-win for everyone involved,” the aforementioned CEO said. The Department of Justice runs seven of these call centers, staffed by “1,700 experienced inmate agents and support staff,” according to the brochure. The department plans to open more soon. In fiscal year 2017, revenue from these call centers and other commercial market services brought in $7.5 million to Unicor. Federal Prison Industries was created in 1934 as a government corporation. At first, inmates in the program mostly held factory jobs, and FPI could only sell goods to federal agencies. FPI later went through a corporate makeover (hence the new name, Unicor) and began creating jobs for inmates to answer customer service calls, ship goods, print manuals, and refurbish vehicles. But it wasn’t until 2011 that Congress allowed Unicor to start selling products and services in the private sector, within certain limits. The idea was that it would better prepare inmates to work in a business environment after their release from prison, and maybe the effort would keep some US companies from outsourcing jobs overseas. This is a twist on President Donald Trump’s “America First” platform to keep factory jobs in the United States. The federal government is marketing prison labor as an enticing alternative for US manufacturers who are thinking about closing factories and moving jobs abroad to save on labor costs, or to those who want to bring jobs back to America. “We can enhance your success ... and your bottom line,” the brochure states. Unicor highlights the experience federal prisoners have producing goods made from metal, plastic, wood, and textiles. The key selling points? Businesses can reduce manufacturing costs while also proudly displaying a “Made in America” label. Here’s the sales pitch: “There’s no need to deal with the hassles and logistical nightmares often associated with outsourcing in a foreign country! We perform many of the labor-intensive services that are moving offshore. And we continually investigate new opportunities to provide skilled labor to commercial firms looking for a stable, productive workforce.” Unicor says prisoners are available to sort, package, and ship products from government warehouses and distribution centers. They’ve been doing this work for federal customers for decades and now they are offering this service to private companies too. “UNICOR has over 100 potential sites located throughout the country that can warehouse your products and provide order fulfillment services customized to your needs, whether your project is a one-time mailing or an ongoing commitment,” the program states in a brochure. Prisoners can also sort magazines, put together marketing flyers, and mail marketing products. The three key selling points for hiring prisoners to do this work? It provides businesses with a “skilled workforce,” “low labor rates,” and “nationwide locations.” These marketing campaigns make this pretty clear: Paying people less than the minimum wage is good for a company’s bottom line. And this kind of exploitative relationship is what prisoners across the country are protesting. Providing inmates with the option to do meaningful work is a worthwhile goal. It allows them not only to buy basic toiletries and goods from prison commissaries but also forces prisoners to save a bit of money for their release. Most prisons also deduct a percentage of earnings to help cover a prisoner’s child support payments, alimony, and restitution to victims. But at 40 cents an hour, that seems impractical. The main argument for paying inmates pennies a day is that it would cost too much money for state and federal prisons to pay them more. There are more costs associated with running a prison factory than any other factory, they say, as they have to make sure there are armed guards and security measures in place. But the federal government has already shown that it’s possible to pay prisoners regular wages without putting prisons in dire financial straits. It currently runs a small program — the Prison Industry Enhancement Program (PIECP) — where about 5,000 state and federal prisoners work for private companies and are guaranteed to earn the average wages for their work. A portion of their wages cover the cost of their room and board in prison, another portion is saved for them to use when they are released, and some of it is set aside to pay alimony, child support, or restitution to victims. Employers must pay inmates the local average wage for the job they do, which cannot be less than the minimum wage. As of 2017, two Unicor factories participated in the PIECP program. There is hardly any research on the effectiveness of PIECP. But researchers from the National Institutes of Justice say that people who participated in this federal program in the late 1990s and early 2000s were twice as likely to hold a steady job after leaving prison, and ended up earning more money in the years immediately following their release than their fellow inmates who worked in prison factories. The conclusion are limited because participants in the program are picked by employers, so it’s possible that employers select workers who are more educated or skilled than the overall prison labor force. But the researchers say that the outcomes suggest the program should be expanded. The PIECP program does have its share of critics. Northstar Asset Management, a financial management company whose investment portfolio only includes socially responsible companies, says employers in the program use loopholes to avoid paying prevailing wages to prisoners who participate. In a report published in 2018, the asset management group also expressed concern about oversight of the program. The Department of Justice outsourced oversight to the National Corrections Industry Association, a group whose membership includes prison officials and the companies who hire workers through the program. “Given the exploitation risks and the profit-enhancing incentives to lower costs further, the fact that [the National Corrections Industry Association] is charged with policing its own dues-paying membership creates a clear and concerning conflict of interest,” the Northstar report authors stated. There is another option. The federal government could eliminate the perverse business incentive to keep people incarcerated, earning pennies per hour. Congress could change the laws that mandate decades-long prison sentences to people convicted of nonviolent crimes. Keeping people out of prison also saves money.

        "articles": "Over the past few years, Governors Bobby Jindal (R-LA) and Sam Brownback (R-KS) massively cut taxes in their states. But this month, in a major defeat for both, they were dragged, kicking and screaming, into raising taxes — while desperately trying to insist they did nothing of the sort. In Louisiana, Jindal agreed that hundreds of millions of dollars more in revenue should be raised — but he demanded the budget be designed in such a way that anti-tax activist Grover Norquist wouldn't count it as a tax hike. In Kansas, the legislature raised revenue by hiking the sales tax and the cigarette tax — yet Brownback said it's \"not accurate\" to characterize the budget as raising taxes. While these weird contortions may look silly, they reveal a lot about the modern GOP and the power of its anti-tax wing. For one thing, Jindal and Brownback's about-faces show Republican governors and state legislators remain deathly afraid of being labeled tax hikers, even if reality forces them to find more revenue. The solutions chosen by Jindal and Brownback are also revealing — because they don't involve raising income tax rates. Instead, the Louisiana deal rolls back various subsidies and credits for businesses, the Kansas deal raises the sales tax (which hurts low- and moderate-income workers most), and both states are hiking cigarette taxes. Indeed, both Jindal and Brownback say they still want to get rid of their states' income taxes entirely at some point. The upshot is that Brownback and Jindal's cuts in income taxes, which made their states' tax codes less progressive, will survive their governorships. And they'll only grow more difficult to reverse as people get used to them. So if the main target of conservative activists is the progressive income tax, then the right is still winning the war. \"Tax increase? What tax increase?\" Al Drago / CQ Roll Call / Getty Shortly after Bobby Jindal took office as Louisiana governor in 2008, he was under heavy pressure to sign a massive tax cut. A few years earlier, the state's voters had narrowly approved a hike in income tax rates for middle- and high-income earners. This measure, the \"Stelly Plan,\" was coupled with cuts on certain sales taxes, and was progressive overall. It soon became intensely controversial. As the Advocate's James Gill recounts, the previous governor, a Democrat, had already hollowed out part of the plan. Jindal was initially hesitant to give up the Stelly Plan's revenue, thinking the change too expensive. But eventually he changed his mind, and teamed with the legislature to repeal its income tax increases entirely (while leaving the sales tax cuts in place). By 2013, Jindal wanted to go even further. He proposed eliminating the state's income and corporate taxes entirely and replacing them with a higher sales tax and cigarette tax. That most recent plan didn't end up passing, but even under what had passed, revenues quickly began to fall short. Jindal cut spending and used various temporary fixes to balance his budgets, promising that soon enough, strong economic growth would refill the state's coffers, as the Associated Press recounts. But when last year's oil price collapse was added to the mix, the state's projected shortfall for its $25 billion budget grew to $1.6 billion. (The majority of the gap, about $1 billion, was because of Jindal's fiscal policies, not oil prices, according to the AP.) Finally, there was no way around it — taxes needed to go up. The deal approved by the legislature last month raised hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue, according to the News Star's Greg Hilburn. It includes a cigarette tax hike, as well as limits on credits and subsidies for businesses in general and the film industry specifically. But there was one big problem — Grover Norquist, the head of the national activist group Americans for Tax Reform, who famously presses politicians to sign a pledge not to raise taxes. Jindal had enthusiastically signed on to Norquist's pledge for governors, and therefore promised to \"oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.\" A flip-flop wasn't in the cards, because Jindal was hoping to launch a presidential campaign later this year. So what was he to do? Jindal created \"a purely fictional, procedural, phantom, paper tax credit\" to pretend he wasn't raising taxes overall Jindal's \"solution\" was truly bizarre. He demanded the legislature approve a program that would charge a new \"fee\" on higher education students that would raise $350 million — but immediately created a \"tax credit\" that would exempt all students from paying that $350 million. Why would Jindal do such a seemingly pointless thing? Because the new \"fee\" apparently does not count as a tax increase under the Norquist pledge, but the new \"tax credit\" counts as a tax cut. So now, to avoid violating the pledge, Jindal could claim that he was counterbalancing hundreds of millions of dollars the revenue was raising with his new tax credit — even though he really wasn't doing anything of the kind, since his supposed tax credit was meant to counteract a fee that he himself had just created. The main objections to this were, interestingly enough, from far-right Louisiana legislators. A group of them harshly criticized Jindal's solution, writing a letter to Norquist calling it \"the biggest threat to fiscal responsibility our state has ever faced,\" since it would let governors raise taxes but \"claim revenue neutrality solely based on the creation of a purely fictional, procedural, phantom, paper tax credit.\" For whatever reason, though, Norquist has decided to go along with Jindal's charade, and didn't deem his solution a tax increase. Republicans called it \"money laundering\" and \"stinky, yucky stuff,\" but the deal was passed, to avert huge cuts to higher education. Even in this deal, many of the fixes remain short-term, and more serious budget-balancing reforms will be left to Jindal's successor (who will take office in January) to handle. Despite all this, Jindal remains unbowed. He's expected to announce his presidential candidacy on Wednesday, and told Louisiana reporters recently that his main regret from his two terms in office was failing to eliminate the Louisiana's income tax entirely. Bo Rader/Wichita Eagle/TNS via Getty Images Governor Sam Brownback of Kansas also had big ambitions to eliminate his state's income tax cuts entirely — ambitions that were derailed by an increasingly dire fiscal situation. Brownback started in 2012 by announcing a plan to cut the top income tax rate from 6.45 percent to 4.9 percent to simplify tax brackets, and to eliminate state income taxes on most small-business income entirely. In a nod to fiscal responsibility, he suggested paying for it by ending several tax deductions and exemptions. But as the bill moved through the state legislature, these deductions proved too popular, and they all stayed in. The bill's estimated price tag rose from about $105 million to $800 million, but Brownback kept supporting it anyway. \"I'm gonna sign this bill, I'm excited about the prospects for it, and I'm very thankful for how God has blessed our state,\" he said. Revenue soon collapsed, education funding was slashed, Moody's cut the state's bond rating, and the state's job growth lagged. Brownback's popularity took a serious hit, too, though he did manage to win reelection in 2014. When he began his second term this January, the state's surplus, which had been built up over several previous years, was finally about to run out, and a shortfall of $600 million for the state's budget of around $15 billion was projected for the 2016 fiscal year. So Brownback acknowledged that revenue had to be raised, and this month legislators approved a deal to raise the state's sales tax (from 6.15 percent to 6.5 percent, one of the highest in the country) and cigarette tax (up 50 cents per pack), along with certain other changes to business taxes and a new tax hike on HMOs. Some of Brownback's scheduled future income tax cuts will be delayed, but not repealed. Here again, getting legislative approval was difficult — since so many legislators (along with Brownback) had signed Grover Norquist's pledge, or a similar one from the group Americans for Prosperity. And unlike in Louisiana, where there was some wiggle room, this deal wasn't Norquist-approved (he called it \"unfortunate backsliding\"). \"Some Republicans cried when they ultimately voted yes,\" wrote Jonathan Shorman of the Topeka Capital-Journal. Brownback has been defiant. \"Some would have you believe this bill represents a tax increase, and that is not accurate,\" the governor said last week. \"When looked at in totality, from 2012 to 2015, as I said at the outset, Kansans are paying less in taxes and continuing to move off income taxes to consumption-based taxes.\" That point is a revealing one — because, according to an analysis by the liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the bottom 40 percent of Kansans by income will, on average, be paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes than they were in 2012. Meanwhile, middle-class Kansans will be paying slightly less, and the top 1 percent of Kansans will be paying, on average, 1.9 percent less: Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy But that may be a feature of Brownback's plan, rather than a bug. It's well-known that sales taxes, which the governor prefers to income taxes, are usually regressive. That's because poor people spend more of their income per year, so sales taxes hit them harder overall. So even though Brownback — like Jindal — has been forced to raise more revenue, he's protected his income tax cuts. The wealthiest Kansans still have a lot to thank him for.

        "articles": "American Sniper has a problem. It's a movie about a black-and-white distinction between good and evil, but it is set almost entirely in the Iraq War, which can only be honestly portrayed in shades of gray. Faced with a choice between altering its narrative to account for that gray versus altering the facts of history, the film chose the latter. It adopted an \"honesty shmonesty\" approach to the war: in its retelling, Iraq was a fight of Good Americans against Bad Terrorists, led by Chris Kyle, the Good-est American of them all. The result is a sort of Hezbollah martyr video for the Fox News set; recruitment propaganda for culture-war extremists. In the world of this movie, the Iraq war is an extension of the war on terror; heroes with guns are our only hope of salvation; and anyone who doubts that is part of the problem. And if the film's historic box office success and many award nominations are anything to go by, that propaganda is frighteningly effective. Warning: This article discusses the plot of American Sniper in its entirety. (Warner Bros) The movie's central moral metaphor is voiced by Kyle's father during a flashback to his childhood. There are, he explains, three types of people in the world: wolves, sheep, and sheepdogs. The evil wolves threaten the sheep. The sheep are good people, but vulnerable to harm because they're too naive to understand that evil exists. That means that it's up to the sheepdogs to protect them from harm. In that metaphor, Kyle is America's border collie, shepherding the weak and vulnerable away from harm. The movie's Big Bad Wolves are al-Qaeda terrorists, led by a psychopathic child-torturer and his marksman sidekick. And the sheep? They would be the other Americans who lack Chris Kyle's vision and fortitude, and fail to understand that you're either with us or against us. That includes fellow US troops who lack Kyle's skill, or who dare to question the war. Iraqis, by contrast, are not sheep: in this movie they're either wolves themselves, or nameless collateral damage. Mostly wolves, though. (Shutterstock.com) American Sniper stacks its narrative deck, using imaginary history and characters to give Kyle a suitably evil foe to fight. While it's never great to see a movie falsify a true story, American Sniper's disdainful attitude towards the truth is especially disingenuous in light of its broader \"you're either with us, or you're a naive sheep\" narrative. To maximize the bigness and badness of its available wolves, American Sniper rewrites history, turning the Iraq War into a response to the attacks of September 11, 2001. The film finds time for entire scenes of Kyle viewing TV news reports about al-Qaeda's 1998 bombings of US embassies, and the planes hitting the Twin Towers on 9/11. And when Kyle gets to Iraq, his commander explains that they are hunting the leaders of al-Qaeda in Iraq. The inference we're supposed to gather is clear: that Kyle is fighting the same people who attacked America in 1998 and 2001. By contrast, the actual reasons for the Iraq war go unmentioned. The words \"Saddam Hussein\" are never uttered in the movie. Nor are \"George Bush,\" \"Sunni,\" \"Shia,\" or \"weapons of mass destruction.\" As Zack Beauchamp points out, this depiction of the war is breathtakingly dishonest. The Iraq War was not a response to 9/11: this was a war America chose, officially based on reports of weapons of mass destruction that were implausible at the time, and that have since been proven false. In real life, Chris Kyle argued that America owed its troops support because those troops did not get to choose the wars they fought, or the strategy they followed: they wrote the government a blank check for their lives and waited to see if it would get cashed. There's a very interesting movie to be made about that idea, and about what it means to be heroic during a misguided war. American Sniper isn't it. Instead, the film heightens the good-vs-evil stakes by supplying Kyle with two fictionalized enemies: \"The Butcher,\" an al-Qaeda in Iraq enforcer famed for his brutality, and \"Mustafa,\" a Syrian who once won Olympic medals for marksmanship, but now spends his days as an al-Qaeda sniper, picking off American soldiers as they go about their noble work. The Butcher is evil personified. He uses a power drill to torture a child to death in front of his screaming family. His workshop in a disused restaurant looks like the set for a cooking show hosted by Hannibal Lecter: a chained, mangled corpse dangles from the kitchen ceiling, and larder shelves are piled with dismembered body parts. Mustafa, on the other hand, is Bizarro Chris Kyle. He's equally skilled with a rifle, but instead of heroically protecting American troops, he's picking them off, one by one. You know, evilly. (Shutterstock.com) The movie's \"sheep\" problem is equally disturbing. The sheep are not the Iraqi civilians terrorized by the Butcher. With the exception of one murdered child and his payoff-demanding father, the Iraqis in the film are pretty much all terrorists or terrorist sympathizers. Rather, the sheep Kyle protects are the other American soldiers. For a movie that's been lauded for its support of the troops, that's a surprisingly disdainful view of their bravery and skill. In the movie's telling, ordinary soldiers' lack of SEAL training makes them sitting ducks (sitting sheep?) for insurgent attacks. At one point, Kyle leaves his sniper's perch to lead a group of Marines as they clear buildings in Fallujah, telling the awed soldiers, who burst with gratitude that the hero Chris Kyle has deigned to join them, that he can show them a thing or two. Even Kyle's own brother is given sheep status: when he deploys with the Marines, it's cause for family concern, not celebration of his heroism. And when Kyle sees him later on an Iraqi airstrip, he's shaking with exhaustion from battlefield trauma. A different movie might have acknowledged that those soldiers were, in many ways, more heroic than Kyle. They took greater risks with less training, and many of them lost their lives in battle as a result. American Sniper, on the other hand, presents them as an undifferentiated mass of grunts, waiting for Chris Kyle to save them. Worse, the movie's sheep-wolves-sheepdog narrative implicitly blames them for their own peril. The \"sheep\" are in danger because they are too naive to understand the evil in the world, not just because they are under-trained or under-resourced. The movie is very clear on that point. In a scene depicting the funeral of Marc Lee, Kyle's friend and fellow SEAL who was killed in action, his mother reads a moving letter Lee wrote a few weeks before his death, in which he questions the legitimacy of wartime glory, and worries that it can lead to an \"unjustified crusade.\" It seems, for a moment, like the film might be attempting to grapple with the justness of the war itself, or at least consider the possibility that a person could be both heroic as an individual, and ambivalent about the greater mission. Nope. Instead, the following scene features an angry rant from Kyle, who insists that \"that letter\" killed Marc, not the bullet that hit him. In the world of American Sniper, doubting your role as champion of good and enemy of evil is a fatal condition. (Shutterstock.com) That with-us-or against us construction is a problem, because the movie isn't just selling a vision of the Iraq War, it's selling a vision of violence as the only effective resistance to the forces of evil. In the movie, Kyle is infallible. We never once see him shoot a civilian who he mistakes for a combatant. When another soldier tells him that the wife of one of Kyle's \"kills\" claims he was carrying a Koran, not a gun, Kyle dismisses his concerns by saying \"I don't know what a Koran looks like,\" before describing in detail the exact type of gun the man was holding. When Kyle shoots a young child and a woman in an early scene, the film is careful to show the grenade they were carrying exploding, leaving no doubt that Kyle was correct about the danger they posed to nearby American troops. In a climactic scene, when Kyle disobeys an order to hold his fire and nearly gets his entire team killed, the movie still eventually validates his decision: he kills the bad guy, and all the good guys survive unharmed. That reinforces the movie's construct of good vs. evil — sheep vs. wolves. Because Kyle is always right, any limits on his use of violence would, by definition, leave American soldiers in danger. That's something only a naive sheep could want. But pretending that heroic sheepdog warriors never accidentally kill civilians is a dangerous lie about the true nature of combat. In the real world, even well-intentioned soldiers do sometimes kill innocent people, because that is how war works. Pretending otherwise is an insult to the many American veterans who have to spend the rest of their lives grappling with their actions during the Iraq War, and to the thousands of innocent Iraqis who have been killed since the conflict began. And it's also dangerous, because it tells Americans not to worry about the harm our wars may do to civilians, who are probably all terrorists anyway. It's bad enough to hide that truth behind euphemisms like \"collateral damage,\" but much worse to write it out of the story completely. (Cryanne) Given all of that, it is hardly surprising that many viewers appear to have absorbed American Sniper's message as \"Muslims are evil and should be killed.\" It would be bad enough if this were merely a shockingly inaccurate portrayal of the Iraq War and an appallingly insulting one of Iraqis themselves. But it's worse, because this movie feeds the narrative that the civilized world is at war with Muslims, that the only solution is to respond with crushing violence, and that people who refuse to believe that are naïfs — sheep, rather — who are dangerously undermining America's security. That's not a story that's limited to Clint-Eastwood-directed warsploitation movies. You'll hear the same thing on Fox News, where this month Jeanine Pirro delivered a bloodthirsty rant calling for mass murder as a solution to the problem of Muslim extremism, and the network repeatedly made the false claim that radical Islamists had taken over parts of European cities, turning them into Muslim-only \"no-go\" zones. That's its own form of dangerous extremism. Its premises are wrong, and its results are dangerous. By feeding that narrative, American Sniper is part of the problem.

        "articles": "Obama got 12 nominees confirmed in 2 days As liberals prepare to fight back against Donald Trump and his nascent administration, they are swiftly finding reasons to be disappointed in the elected leadership of the Democratic Party. Liberal senators like Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren are voting to confirm Ben Carson as secretary of housing and urban development, outraging grassroots progressives. Ben Carson openly said that he was against constitutional rights for Muslims - and Dems are voting him in. Democrats are going soft on proposed Small Business Administration chief Linda McMahon, setting off even more establishment-oriented outlets like the Center for American Progress’s ThinkProgress blog. And they’re offering a mixed message on Jeff Sessions’s selections to lead the Department of Justice. 7. Only 17 Democrats are publicly opposing Sessions, who couldn't get confirmed as a federal judge because of his history of racism Meanwhile, even as congressional Democrats mobilize to stymie Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they say they are trying to call Trump’s bluff on infrastructure spending by introducing their own plan for $1 trillion in direct spending, a political tactic Jonathan Chait denounces as “delusional” on the grounds that anything that gives Trump bipartisan cover on anything will boost his popularity. In the pungent words of the New Republic’s Clio Chang, “Democrats are already screwing this up” — citing Democrats’ selective willingness to vote yes on some of Trump’s Cabinet nominees. Lurking in the background is the accurate perception that Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell orchestrated an unprecedented and successful years-long campaign of obstruction to Barack Obama’s agenda, a campaign aimed in part at policy victories but largely at delegitimizing the new president and denying him the halo of bipartisanship. Is it really possible that Democrats have learned so little from the success of McConnell’s “just say nothing” approach? The reality, however, is that while McConnell certainly did break precedent and certainly did have this kind of strategy, GOP opposition was less across-the-board than it’s remembered in liberal folk history. Obama passed a number of significant bills with Republican support in his first two years in office, and Democrats have, thus far, been drastically less cooperative with Trump’s Cabinet nominees than Republicans were with Obama’s. McConnell’s success wasn’t that he literally held his caucus together in unanimous opposition to everything. It’s that he made sure the political agenda was dominated by the things he was choosing to oppose — most of all the Affordable Care Act — rather than the things that divided his caucus. Democrats’ core strategy at the moment is to paint Trump as a closet plutocrat, and to focus on aspects of his agenda that point to tax cuts, financial deregulation, school privatization, and health care cutbacks. And their votes have been consistent with that. Obama was inaugurated on January 20, standing in front of a record crowd despite the freezing cold weather. The very next day the Senate confirmed six of his Cabinet secretaries — Hillary Clinton, Ken Salazar, Tom Vilsack, Steven Chu, Arne Duncan, and Janet Napolitano. Clinton received two no votes, Duncan and Napolitano received so little opposition that Senate only did unrecorded voice votes, and the other three were literally unanimous. The very next day, the Senate unanimously confirmed Obama’s nominees for HUD, Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, United Nations ambassador, Securities and Exchange Commission chair, and the Council on Environmental Qualities. Other Obama nominees were more controversial but still had plenty of Republican support. Eric Holder, not exactly a conservative favorite, got 19 Republican votes. Hilda Solis got 24. Ron Kirk got 38. Tim Geithner got 10. Kathleen Sebelius ended up being the most contentious nomination, since anti-abortion groups decided to go hard at her, but she still got nine Republican votes. At the time, there were only 40 Republican senators, so that meant about a quarter of the GOP caucus was voting for even the most controversial nominees. Trump’s nominees have received much less support than Obama’s. Even his least controversial nominees like Defense Secretary James Mattis and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have drawn token opposition from someone looking to make a point. Obama’s legislative agenda, of course, met with considerably more resistance. But though his signature creation of a new health care program — paired with a consequential overhaul of student loans — was famously passed on a strict party line vote, basically nothing else he did was. That includes a stimulus bill that was backed by three Republicans (one of whom was later run out of the party as a result and became a Democrat) and the Dodd-Frank financial regulation overhaul (backed, like the stimulus, by the two Maine Republicans, this time joined by Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown). But there was also a whole raft of less controversial — but still consequential — bills that passed with bipartisan majorities: Beyond those seven measures, the 111th Congress also passed a series of lower-profile economic stimulus measures — an employment benefits extension, a payroll tax holiday, the “cash for clunkers” program — outside of the main stimulus bill, all of which garnered at least a handful of Republican votes. To be clear, Democrats who say that Obama faced an unprecedented level of partisan opposition are not misremembering. George W. Bush came into office with a much weaker electoral mandate than Obama, but nonetheless ended up getting a dozen Senate Democrats to vote for his tax cut plan. After the GOP gained seats in the 2002 midterms, Democrats simply chose to allow the GOP to pass a Medicare reform plan without filibustering it, even though the Republicans didn’t have 60 votes to pass the bill. Democrats were surprised to see that they received no comparable deference on anything. They were also surprised by the GOP leadership’s determination to simply throw as much sand in the gears as possible of many of these bills — using extensive delaying tactics even when they didn’t have the votes to block legislation — in order to chew up floor time and limit the amount Democrats could accomplish. Republicans also used their filibustering prerogatives to delay or block the confirmation of many sub-Cabinet appointees, often for trivial reasons. Most of all, McConnell ensured that the dominant narrative of Obama’s first year in office was one of highly partisan conflict. The stimulus passed with some GOP votes and was honestly not that substantively different from the Republican alternative. But as the economy continued to deteriorate, Republicans excoriated it as a blunder and a failure. They lured Democrats into a trap on health care, where Chuck Grassley and others maintained a protracted facade of bipartisan negotiations even while party leaders endlessly slagged the reform process. It’s not that nothing else got done so much as nobody heard about anything else. And — with a not-so-trivial helping hand from objectively bleak background economic conditions — it paid off in the 2010 midterms. Republicans would counter, of course, that this was all merely retaliation for unprecedented Democratic obstruction during the Bush administration. Democrats counter-charge that Bill Clinton faced unprecedented obstruction. Republicans say the real problem was the tactics Democrats used to block Robert Bork’s Supreme Court confirmation back in the 1980s. The truth is that this is a ratchet that has been shifting for a long time. In the middle of the 20th century, the two political parties did not offer clearly contrasting ideologies. That meant members of Congress generally felt cross-pressured between partisan and ideological imperatives, and it fostered a broadly cooperative atmosphere. For decades now that has been changing, as both parties have become more ideological and thus members of Congress from both parties face more pressure from their respective activist bases to “stand up to” the other side. This means each new president is greeted by a level of uncooperativeness from the opposition party that is genuinely unprecedented. The “Reagan Revolution” of 1981-’82 was undertaken even though Democrats held a majority in the House of Representatives because Speaker Tip O’Neil was willing to repeatedly bring Republican bills to the floor that would then pass with the support of a small number of conservative Democrats — a scenario that is totally unthinkable under today’s legislative norms. Democrats are responding to the Trump administration by offering — so far — an unprecedentedly low level of support for his Cabinet nominees. They are signaling potential willingness to pass an infrastructure spending program that, if it comes together, would essentially amount to Trump coming around to a view Democrats have espoused for years. Meanwhile, there is zero indication of any Democratic support for any Republican Party legislative initiatives to reduce taxes or federal spending. Given the combination of rising polarization, Trump’s unprecedentedly low approval ratings, and Trump’s unique personal attributes, an unprecedented lack of cross-party support is probably to be expected. But the ratchet of activist expectations has moved even faster than the ratchet of legislative reality, and consequently Democrats currently find themselves disappointing their own supporters, who want them to adopt a posture of root-and-branch opposition that they mistakenly believe McConnell took eight years ago.

        "articles": "Let’s say you’re at the doctor. And the doctor hands you a prescription. The prescription is for Humira, an injectable medication used to treat a lot of common conditions like arthritis and psoriasis. Humira is an especially popular medication right now. In 2015, patients all around the world spent $14 billion on Humira prescriptions — that’s roughly the size of Jamaica's entire economy. Let’s say your doctor appointment is happening in the United Kingdom. There, your Humira prescription will cost, on average, $1,362. If you’re seeing a doctor in Switzerland, the drug runs around $822. But if you’re seeing a doctor in the United States, your Humira prescription will, on average, run you $2,669. Humira is the exact same drug whether it’s sold in the United States, in Switzerland, or anywhere else. What’s different about Humira in the United States is the regulatory system we’ve set up around our pharmaceutical industry. The United States is exceptional in that it does not regulate or negotiate the prices of new prescription drugs when they come onto market. Other countries will task a government agency to meet with pharmaceutical companies and haggle over an appropriate price. These agencies will typically make decisions about whether these new drugs represent any improvement over the old drugs — whether they’re even worth bringing onto the market in the first place. They’ll pore over reams of evidence about drugs’ risks and benefits. The United States allows drugmakers to set their own prices for a given product — and allows every drug that's proven to be safe come onto market. And the problems that causes are easy to see, from the high copays at the drugstore to the people who can’t afford lifesaving medications. What’s harder to see is that if we did lower drug prices, we would be making a trade-off. Lowering drug profits would make pharmaceuticals a less desirable industry for investors. And less investment in drugs would mean less research toward new and innovative cures. There’s this analogy that Craig Garthwaite, a professor at Kellogg School of Management who studies drug prices, gave me that helped make this clear. Think about a venture capitalist who is deciding whether to invest $10 million in a social media app or a cure for pancreatic cancer. “As you decrease the potential profits I’m going to make from pancreatic cures, I’m going to shift more of my investment over to apps or just keep the money in the bank and earn the money I make there,” Garthwaite says. Right now America’s high drug prices mean that investing in pharmaceuticals can generate a whole bunch of profits — and that drugs can be too expensive for Americans to afford. You’re going to want to start setting up some meetings with agencies that make decisions about drug coverage and prices. These regulatory bodies generally evaluate two things: whether the country wants to buy your drug and, if so, how much they’ll pay for it. These decisions are often related, as regulators evaluate whether your new drug is enough of an improvement on whatever is already on the market to warrant a higher price. So let’s say you want to sell your drug in Australia. You’ll have to submit an application to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, where you’ll attempt to prove that your drug is more effective than whatever else is on the market right now. The committee will then make a recommendation to the country’s national health care system of whether to buy the drug — and, if the recommendation is to buy it, the committee will suggest what price the health plan ought to pay. Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is not easy to impress: It has rejected about half of the anti-cancer drug applications it received in the past decade because their benefits didn’t seem worth the price. But if you do succeed — and Australia deems your drug worthy to cover — then you’ll have to decide whether the committee has offered a high enough price. If so, congrats! You’ve entered the Australian drug market. Countries like Australia, Canada, and Britain don’t regulate the price of other things that consumers buy, like computers or clothing. But they and dozens of other countries have made the decision to regulate the price of drugs to ensure that medical treatment remains affordable for all citizens, regardless of their income. Medication is treated differently because it is a good that some consumers, quite literally, can’t live without. This decision comes with policy trade-offs, no doubt. Countries like Australia will often refuse to cover drugs that they don’t think are worth the price. In order for regulatory agencies to have leverage in negotiating with drugmakers, they have to be able to say no to the drugs they don’t think are up to snuff. This means certain drugs that sell in the United States aren’t available in other countries — and there are often public outcries when these agencies refuse to approve a given drug. At the same time, just because there are more drugs on the American market, that doesn’t mean all patients can access them. “To think that patients have full access to a wide range of products isn’t right,” says Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “If the drugs are so expensive that you can’t afford them, that’s functionally the same thing as not even having them on the market.” It also doesn’t mean we’re necessarily getting better treatment. Other countries’ regulatory agencies usually reject drugs when they don’t think they provide enough benefit to justify the price that drugmakers want to charge. In the United States, those drugs come onto market — which means we get expensive drugs that offer little additional benefit but might be especially good at marketing. This happened in 2012 with a drug called Zaltrap, which treats colorectal cancer. The drug cost about $11,000 per month — twice as much as its competitors — while, in the eyes of doctors, offering no additional benefit. “In most industries something that offers no advantage of its competitors and yet sells for twice the price would never even get on the market,” Peter Bach, an oncologist at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital, wrote in a New York Times op-ed. “But that is not how things work for drugs. The Food and Drug Administration approves drugs if they are shown to be ‘safe and effective.’ It does not consider what the relative costs might be.” The United States has no government panel that negotiates drug prices. There are thousands of health insurance plans all across the country. Each has to negotiate its own prices with drugmakers separately. Because Americans are fragmented across all these different health insurers, plans have much less bargaining power to demand lower prices. In other words: Australia is buying drugs in bulk, like you would at Costco, while we’re picking up tiny bottles at the local pharmacy. You can guess who is paying more. “You could say that American health care providers and pharmaceuticals are essentially taking advantage of the American public because they have such a fragmented system,” Tom Sackville, president of the International Federation of Health Plans, says. “The system is so divided, it’s easy to conquer.” There is one especially large health insurance plan in the United States: Medicare, which covers about 55 million Americans over the age of 65. But federal law expressly prohibits Medicare from negotiating drug prices or making decisions about which drugs it covers. Instead, Medicare is required to cover nearly all drugs that the Food and Drug Administration approves. This means that Medicare must cover drugs that aren’t an improvement over what currently exists, so long as the FDA finds they’re safe for human consumption. Drugmakers know that as long as their products are safe, Medicare will buy them. “For Medicare, the sky really is the limit,” on drug prices, says Jamie Love, who has studied drug pricing and directs the DC nonprofit Knowledge Ecology International. The result of this system is that Americans spend $858 per person on prescription drugs. That’s about twice as much as Australians and three times as much as the Dutch. There isn’t much evidence that Americans use an inordinately high amount of prescription drugs. It's just that when we buy prescription medications, we pay more for the exact same product. These are the prices for the cancer drug Avastin in different countries. And these are the prices for Harvoni, a drug that cures hepatitis C. Pick any brand-name drug, and you’ll almost certainly find that the price in the United States is significantly higher than in other countries. For one thing, we’d spend less on prescription drugs. If the United States set up an agency that negotiated drug prices on behalf of the country’s 319 million residents, it would likely be able to demand discounts similar to those of European countries. This would mean that health insurance premiums wouldn’t go up nearly as quickly — they might even go down. There would be trade-offs. We’d likely have to give up some of the choice of drugs that our insurance plans cover. If a national board made decisions about what prices were appropriate for drugs, it would need to have the ability to reject the drugs that didn’t make the cut. Consider the Veterans Health Administration, which does negotiate drug prices. It gets drugs that are usually 40 percent cheaper than what Medicare pays. But it also covers fewer products. Margot Sanger-Katz recently reported for the New York Times that “many older patients who get their health insurance from the V.A. also sign up for Medicare drug plans to cover medicines that the V.A. won’t.” At the same time, VA doctors do say their patients are generally able to obtain the medications they prescribe. Investors respond to economic incentives. When they see a market that will pay lots of money for their products, they’ll put more money toward developing the type of drugs that market wants. Consider the hypothetical venture capitalist from earlier, who is thinking about whether to fund a biotech firm or a social media startup. Part of that decision will revolve around the type of business that interests her — and part around what profits she thinks can be made. We’ve seen this happen in real life, too: When the government mandates the coverage of a new type of drug, there are more clinical trials to develop that particular treatment. Consider the work of MIT economist Amy Finkelstein. She looked at what happened after Medicare began covering the flu vaccine for its millions of enrollees. And she found that with the usage of the flu vaccine guaranteed to increase, there was a 2.5-fold increase in clinical trials for new flu vaccines. Separate research shows a significant increase in research dollars for drugs that the elderly typically take after Medicare began covering prescription drugs in 2005. Right now, the United States’ exceptionally high drug prices help subsidize the rest of the world’s drug research. We benefit from that work with new and better prescriptions — and so does the rest of the world. In other words: Right now, the United States is subsidizing the rest of the world’s drug research by paying out really high prices. If we stopped doing that, it would likely mean fewer dollars spent on pharmaceutical research — and less progress developing new drugs for Americans and everybody else. Every policy decision comes with trade-offs, and that’s true of regulating drug prices. If the United States began to price regulate drugs, medications would become cheaper. That would mean Americans have more access to drugs but could also expect a decline in research and development of new drugs. We might have fewer biotech firms starting up, or companies deciding it’s worth bringing a new drug to market. That might be okay: We might decide as a society that we are willing to trade some level of innovative to lower drug prices and make medication more financially accessible to those who need them right now. It’s a hard question to think about: Do we want to lower the price of the hepatitis C cure that hit the market for $84,000 — knowing that price controls might lead to less investment in pursuing other cures in the future? “If you have hepatitis C today, you probably want to have the drug for a cheaper price,” Garthwaite says. “If you have pancreatic cancer today, you probably want to do everything you can to get more money put into the research and development pipeline to cure that disease.” He adds, “This isn’t an easy question to think about, how much innovation we’re comfortable paying for — or the idea that we might be spending too much on innovation.” But it’s a conversation that America’s exceptionally high drug prices are forcing us to consider, as drug prices skyrocket — and one in four Americans report trouble paying for their prescription drugs. Are we, as a country, comfortable paying higher prices for drugs to get more innovation? Or would we trade some of that innovation to make our drugs more accessible to those of all income levels?

        "articles": "Minimum wages are a perennially controversial topic in the politics of countries all around the world. And yet despite the debate, virtually all developed countries have a minimum wage either set by law or set quasi-legally through an industry collective bargaining process. Yet, as British economist Simon Wren-Lewis noted in July, discussion of the minimum wage's natural complement — the maximum wage — is taboo in most circles. But the case for a maximum wage or something very much like it — say, a confiscatory marginal tax rate far too high to raise meaningful revenue — is surprisingly strong. LeBron James in Guangzhou (China Foto) One place to look to understand the implications of the maximum wage is an industry that actually has a maximum wage: professional basketball. The rules governing the NBA salary structure are extremely complicated, but one feature of them is a limit (\"the max\") on how big a contract any given player can receive. This is why things like LeBron James' bouts of free agency become such unpredictable events. The market for James' services is not an auction in which he ends up playing for the highest bidder. Instead, all bids are capped at the maximum wage, and every owner with half a brain would gladly pay James (or Kevin Durant or Chris Paul or a handful of other megastars) the maximum salary, so the ultimate decision comes down to non-monetary factors like teammates and title chances. But basketball is still a business, and the maximum wage has economic ripple effects. In particular, it serves to significantly advantage the league's middle class of talent. Since the Cleveland Cavaliers didn't need to spend all their available financial resources on James, they had spare cash to bid for the services of lesser (but still skilled!) players. As a result, even though winning in the NBA is typically driven by a handful of dominant stars, even average players are extremely well-compensated. Rookies aside, the league features a ratio of about 20:1 between the highest-paid and worst-paid players, with undistinguished athletes frequently reaping multi-million dollar deals. The most important lesson, however, is what the maximum salary doesn't do — lead the stars to Go Galt and take their talents to the retirement community. For starters, the top stars get paid a lot of money! But more than that, it turns out that to be successful at high-level professional basketball requires a certain level of passion for the sport and competitive instinct. Players want to win games and outshine their rivals on the biggest stages. Stars not only play for sub-market wages professionally, but they often play for free for their national team in the Olympics. Top performers like money, but they also take pride in a job well done. Top US marginal tax rates over time (guest2626) The idea of a maximum wage sounds outlandish today. But though no such maximum wage level has ever been embedded in America law, it's worth noting that until relatively recently we had a de facto maximum wage policy in place. The Second World War pushed the top marginal tax rate up to 90 percent. The Kennedy administration adjusted that down to 70 percent and there it stood until Ronald Reagan's election. Neither of those was a formal maximum. But they acted as a maximum wage. During the 90 percent top income tax rate, for a firm to put an extra $100 in the pocket of a top executive required them to pay onother $1,000 in salary. Rather than send $900 to Uncle Sam to pay a CFO an extra $100, it makes more sense to give modest raises to five separate middle managers — putting more money in the pockets of your workforce and less in the pockets of the federal government. And the thing about this high tax policy regime is that it worked pretty well! The pre-Reagan trend of productivity growth in the American economy was faster than the post-Reagan trend. At the same time, the distribution of the gains from economic growth was more equal pre-Reagan than post-Reagan. Of course, by the late-1970s the economy had run into trouble. Oil shocks from the Middle East were battering the economy, and their negative impact was exacerbated by poor monetary policy. The resulting \"stagflation\" quite naturally led to a push for substantial policy change, and substantial policy change is what we got. Those changes included, among other things, a shift to a new tax policy regime that no longer sought to deter high salaries and promote an egalitarian distribution of market income. The thinking was that more inequality would create better financial incentives and more rapid economic growth. A rising tide would lift all boats, and nobody would miss equality in the midst of broad-based prosperity. Maybe this guy could teach math instead (John Moore/Getty) Over the past 35 years we have gotten the inequality that Reagan promised. What hasn't been forthcoming is the more rapid economic growth. A maximum wage would definitely help solve inequality: firms would spend less on bidding up the pay for the richest workers and that would free up more resources for middle-class salaries. And it is now a commonplace of progressive discourse to argue that executive compensation growth largely reflects rent-seeking that could be rolled back without impairing managerial talent. But there is actually some reason to believe that a maximum wage could improve growth outcomes and help up bring back some of the higher growth rates experienced before the late 1970s. The key reason for believing this might be possible comes to us from a paper by economists Benjamin Lockwood, Charles Nathanson, and Glen Weyl. They observe that not all jobs are created equal. What Lockwood, Nathanson, and Weyl find is that by increasing the financial incentive for top talent to pursue careers in finance and law rather than teaching and research, the Reagan tax reforms reduced overall economic output while increasing the pre-tax share of income earned by top earners. In other words, rather than giving the middle class a smaller slice of a bigger pie and making everyone better off, these reforms gave the rich a larger slice of a smaller pie and made only them better off. Bringing back the notion of a cap or near-cap on wages, in other words, could make the country more prosperous and make prosperity more broadly shared. A related issue is raised by Facundo Alvaredo, Anthony Atikinson, Thomas Piketty, and Emmanuel Saez who find that lower tax rates have shifted incentives for executives at big companies such that effort is now \"diverted to increasing their remuneration at the expense of enterprise growth and employment.\" In other words, in a high-tax regime executives compete to run the biggest, best company for pride and glory whereas in a low-tax regime they compete to take home the biggest paycheck. Redistribution party! (Cartsen Koall/Getty) Of course, it's one thing to say that the country should try to cap top-earners' wages and another thing entire to say exactly what a maximum wage policy should look like. The basic reality is that as with a minimum wage, the correct answer needs to be determined empirically. At the moment, there is very little research available on the subject to guide our thinking, and so little has been done in policy terms that there isn't even much empirical information to research. Another issue is that the precise terms of the maximum wage policy need to be ironed out. Though it will rankle some, capital gains income will almost certainly have to be excluded from the policy. To do otherwise would create a massive disincentive for wealthy people to ever sell the things they own — preventing the reallocation of capital to more productive uses. But the differential treatment will create a large loophole that people will seek to exploit. Already hedge fund managers have found ways to characterize what is clearly a form of management fees as a form of investment income in order to enjoy a lower tax rate. Closing that loophole and similar ones should be a priority. One good starting point toward a maximum wage policy would be revisit a 1993 law intended to curb CEO pay. The rule in question said that executive salaries of over $1,000,000 a year could not be deducted from companies' corporate income tax bill. That would be a powerful reason to pay less and redistribute resources inside the firm. But the rule had a gigantic loophole: performance-based pay is exempted. It's trivial to classify CEO pay as performance-based pay. So these days CEOs are paid more than ever before and whatever they happen to do is deemed excellent performance. Rewriting section 162(m) of the law to have a higher threshold ($10 million?) with no performance loophole would put a dent in the problem, and also generate some potentially relevant data. But eventually the goal is to impose a new super-high top marginal income tax rate — something like the old 90 percent top rate — at a very high income threshold. Happy German factory worker (Ute Grabowsky/Photothek) Only time and research will tell us exactly what the right numbers are. But here are two guiding principles. The super-tax should attempt to bend the Laffer Curve and modestly reduce the amount of federal tax revenue, and the super-tax should try to avoid seriously reducing the number of hours people work. What you want to do is levy a tax rate that's high enough that almost nobody pays it. But you also want the tax threshold to be high enough that it doesn't induce doctors to see fewer patients and spend more time on vacation. The idea is to nudge corporate executives and big-time finance guys to pay themselves less. For executives, that will leave more money in corporate treasuries to spend on other workers or new investments. For finance, it will leave talented individuals with less-lucrative but more socially-useful careers to pursue. This is counterintuitive to policymakers who mostly think of taxes as ways to raise revenue. But if you're trying to create a maximum wage then a tax rate that people are paying is a tax rate that's too low. At the same time, a tax rate that's convincing extremely productive workers to simply stop working as hard is hurting the country rather than helping. You want to get in that NBA sweet spot where top CEOs, like top athletes, will still work hard for the sake of money and glory and competition but a larger share of the enterprise's financial rewards flow to the middle class.

        "articles": "The Dallas Morning News broke with more than 75 years of tradition on Wednesday morning to endorse a Democrat for president, choosing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. And in doing so, they got right to the point: \"There is only one serious candidate on the presidential ballot in November,\" the editorial began. \"We recommend Hillary Clinton.\" The Dallas Morning News’ editorial page is very, very conservative. It hasn’t endorsed a Democrat for president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1940. (Its unbroken streak of Republicans has one exception: In 1964, the newspaper declined to choose between Barry Goldwater and Lyndon Baines Johnson.) And the editorial included a critique of the Democratic Party’s \"over-reliance on government and regulation.\" But the editorial went on to savage Trump: He plays on fear — exploiting base instincts of xenophobia, racism and misogyny — to bring out the worst in all of us, rather than the best. His serial shifts on fundamental issues reveal an astounding absence of preparedness. And his improvisational insults and midnight tweets exhibit a dangerous lack of judgment and impulse control. Clinton, the editorial board wrote, is a \"known quantity.\" The endorsement is a sign of how much Trump’s campaign has shaken even staunch bastions of Republicanism. But will it matter to anybody else? Given how polarized American politics have become — not to mention the waning influence of newspapers — it’s reasonable to be skeptical that any Republicans were sitting around waiting to hear what the Dallas Morning News had to think before making up their mind on Trump. According to a study published in 2011, though, an unusual endorsement like this might matter precisely because it’s not what readers expected to hear. Newspaper endorsements change the most minds when they break with the usual pattern to endorse a candidate of the other party. Two political scientists, Chun-Fang Chiang, of National Taiwan University, and Brian Knight, of Brown University, studied the effect of newspaper endorsements in 2000 and 2004, using a survey that asked voters in the days leading up to the election about which newspapers they read and which candidates they preferred. The researchers sorted newspapers on a spectrum based on how likely they were to endorse Democrats for president. The Dallas Morning News was the most predictably conservative of the group — endorsing Democrats just 17 percent of the time. At the other end of the spectrum, the New York Times endorsed Democrats 90 percent of the time. They found that when Democratic-leaning newspapers endorsed Republicans for president, or vice versa, readers were slightly more likely to support the candidate the newspaper endorsed. If newspapers endorsed the candidates that typically lined up with the editorial page’s ideology, though, they didn’t really convince anyone. The effects were greatest among people who had seen the endorsement, as you might expect, and among older readers, who were more likely to read the editorial page. The study’s findings might not be as true today. Newspaper circulation has fallen 20 percent since 2004, the last election the researchers studied, and more and more Americans are getting their news online or other ways. Pew found that 81 percent of the public gets at least some of its news online. Meanwhile, the American public has become even more polarized. Still, given the Dallas Morning News’ strict conservative bent, its choice to endorse Clinton isn’t just making headlines — research suggests it could make a real difference.

        "articles": "The left can win over rural America without compromising its values. But it will take time and building relationships. When I go home to South Dakota to visit my family, I speak two languages. One is the language of my new home in California, of my job in the national media, a freewheeling speech that blends irony and academia and weird jokes. You’re probably familiar with this language if you read a lot of left-leaning internet sites. The other is the language of my youth, and its hallmark is a sincere, aching tone that longs for salvation and worries everything is about to crumble. We talked a lot about the end of things when I was growing up, about the last trumpet and Armageddon. But when I sit and talk with family, it sounds almost as if the apocalypse came and went in the form of government regulation. When did this regulation happen? It’s never clear. The government has just gotten too big, too all-encompassing. Aren’t you angry about that? goes the unspoken question. Well, you should be. I don’t say anything. I don’t want to upset the precarious balance between old life and new. I just listen and laugh and nod. If you want to understand the anger rippling through rural, white America, especially among older folks, sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild has written the single best book you can read. Called Strangers in Their Own Land, it concerns Hochschild’s visits to rural Louisiana, far from her home in Berkeley, California. Hochschild’s deepest insight stopped me dead in my tracks. I went back and read it four or five times. She writes that the people she interviewed in Louisiana felt as if they were being made to feel certain ways because the media wanted them to. They believed that if they found marriage equality to be a step too far, or if they didn’t entirely understand the meaning of or need for “Black Lives Matter,” or if they didn’t want to see sex depicted on TV, or if they thought owning a gun could be a lot of fun, well, they weren’t feeling the “right” way, and they would be mocked for doing so. Try to set aside, for a second, your political feelings on all of the above. Think only of how rarely people who feel any or all of the above are presented by mainstream mass media as sensible. There’s nothing wrong with owning a gun. There’s nothing wrong with being cautious about sex. There’s not even anything wrong with not immediately understanding the ideas behind Black Lives Matter. But how often does progressive pop culture treat any of the above cultural signifiers as the signs of a person with a rich inner life? People who believe the above are often presented as dumb yokels on TV and in movies, and if you push further, racists and sexists are presented as outright villains or “behind the times” in period pieces. Even Mad Men, which flirted as much as any project recently has with endorsing casual racism and sexism, made sure to signal to the audience that it knew all of this was Not Okay through carefully chosen directorial and writing decisions. HBO’s Vice Principals, perhaps the only show on TV that truly tries to understand Trump’s America, prompted much fretting over whether the show recognized that its white male heroes — who were trying to tear down a black woman who had the job they wanted — knew what they were doing was Wrong, even as they were burning down her house. Look back to the 1970s. Think of popular, Best Picture–winning movies like The French Connection, where lead character Popeye Doyle is an unrepentant racist but gets the job done. Think of All in the Family’s Archie Bunker, a racist and sexist who, nonetheless, is fiercely loyal to his family and willing to admit when he’s underestimated someone based on the color of her skin. These characters rarely exist in modern film and TV, or they’d be the butt of the joke, not allowed to make jokes of their own. Left-leaning culture doesn’t attempt to understand; it attempts to isolate that which says “the wrong thing.” It too often embraces easy moralizing over complexity — and even if you agree with the morals, that’s disappointing. National Review’s Henry Olsen even pointed to an Archie Bunker factor when he predicted a Trump victory was more likely than most other pundits believed. The online multicultural left is too often intent on making sure our entertainment, our news sources, and our political heroes send the “right” messages, that everybody learns the right things. But we’re increasingly only talking to ourselves. Hochschild notes that the people she spoke to in Louisiana emphasized what they believed to be a fundamental contradiction in liberalism: It was tolerant of everything but their views, which it called intolerant. That’s true on both ends — conservative and progressive. Certainly, I’m not going to step back and say, during an argument about trans bathroom rights, “Wow, you really have a point about how trans people are just making up their identity so they can sneak into places where they don’t belong.” Trying to empathize with that point of view rejects the lived experience of every trans person I know. But I also immediately snap, too often, to calling such views intolerant, instead of trying to figure out where they come from. Older rural whites usually express their frustrations in some variation of “I’m sick of political correctness,” which I find maddening — since political correctness in my view just means treating people politely. What’s wrong with calling someone by their preferred pronouns? Nothing, if you’re steeped in ideas about antiquated gender binaries and the like. But if you’ve never even met a trans person, the existence of trans people, much less the idea that they have inherent rights, can be a big leap to make, as is the case for plenty of older rural whites. (See also: the close cousin to “I’m sick of political correctness,” “Why do people hate white men all of a sudden?”) To be clear: I do not want to advocate for giving an inch on any of these issues. Ending racial, misogynistic, anti-LGBTQ, and classist power structures is essential to the future of this country, as is ending the enormous levels of income inequality. But I also think progressive America has become too quick to leap to crying racism or sexism — even when talking about genuinely dangerous, racist, and sexist ideas — instead of trying to unpack what’s motivating those ideas. The rise of the alt-right shows that these dark ideas are not going away without a fight. That’s what makes it so important for progressives to get better at communicating what they mean and fighting for what they believe in. I say “racism” and mean “a system, built up over centuries of American history, that privileges white people over everybody else.” Many rural whites hear “racism” and think it means, “You’re a bad person who hates black people,” when they believe they’re not actively discriminating against anyone because of race. And that goes for plenty of other terms as well — “privilege” or “rape culture” or even “feminism.” There’s a communication gap, and there has to be a way to bridge it. Much of that is on rural white America, yes, but some of it necessarily is on urban progressives, as well. Because if the 2016 election has made anything clear, it’s that older rural whites are now acting like an interest group, who will vote for any party that even pays lip service to their desires. And though their demographic power is waning, there are still a lot of them. And they watch TV. They believe they know what progressives think of them. Okay, yes, this is another article about rural white people. Amid the rise of Trump, trying to understand his supporters has become something of a cottage industry. There have been profiles, good and bad and satirical. There have been attempts to understand their plight via economic means and via racial anxiety. There’s nothing wrong with any of that. Rural America has been hollowed out by a ruling class that no longer has much use for it. The Democratic Party sometimes pays lip service to rebuilding manufacturing communities via new job training and the like, but never seems to make doing so a priority — a bitter irony for those who remember when the Democrats were the party of labor. Before I go any further, I want to clarify two things. The first is that this is not a piece about progressivism winning back rural America. I’m not sure such a thing is possible, en masse, and there are no easy answers to this problem. Progressive economic policy might not be as redistributive as many (including myself) would like, but it is, on average, better for rural America than conservative economic policy. (See my colleagues Ezra Klein and Dylan Matthews for more on that point.) And over the course of my life, I’ve spoken with many people in rural America who know conservative economic policy won’t benefit them but care much more about deporting undocumented immigrants or ending abortion rights. But there are also some rural whites — a minority, I think, but some — who are receptive to progressive messages on all sorts of economic and social policy issues but don’t feel heard or understood. There is a performative aspect to life in rural areas (which I wrote more about here) that too often gets overlooked, and I have had many, many conversations with rural whites who say Democrats just don’t hear them or understand them. Again, I don’t think there’s an easy answer to this, but I think an answer does exist, and we ignore those who are receptive to it at our peril. But even if there isn’t an answer, empathy is a good thing, whether or not we still condemn rural whites’ various deeply held beliefs. Understanding where those beliefs come from is vital to crafting messages that will beat them back. The second thing I want to clarify is that what I’m saying might seem like a rough gloss on Emmett Rensin’s excellent, earlier piece for this site “The smug style in American liberalism.” And while my argument shares several points with Rensin’s — particularly when it comes to how progressives express themselves online — it’s more about how progressive America presents itself as the de facto face of all of America, often through its pop culture. The whole of progressive America doesn’t have a lot of control over that, because progressives don’t all work in the entertainment industry. But rural America rarely sees itself reflected back in pop culture. That might seem like a silly complaint, but it’s creating alienation, as I’ll dig into below. To grow up in rural America is to know that your odds of financial success are lower than ever before. Even a state with 2.9 percent unemployment — like my home state — struggles with how wages have not risen at the same accelerated pace as the cost of living. To many of South Dakota’s children, finding success means leaving their hometowns, as I and some of my friends have, whether for urban areas within the state or other states entirely. I don’t want to understate the racial component here. It’s probably the most important part of understanding the rise of Trump. The forces driving Trump’s most fervent supporters are almost all racially based, from anti-immigration positions to Trump’s proposed plan to ban Muslims from entering the US. (Read more on this topic from Matthews right here.) And even states with populations as monochromatic as South Dakota’s — it’s just over 86 percent white — can be driven to distraction by fear of a racial other. (For more on this topic, a recent This American Life episode is essential.) But Trump didn’t just win South Dakota. He crushed South Dakota by around 30 percentage points. And I can’t help but feel as if the attempts to paint Trump supporters with the broadest possible brush — sometimes because they deserve it! — miss a fundamental part of his appeal, one that’s almost entirely cultural. I was once one of those rural conservatives who would have voted for Trump gladly, a South Dakota boy rolling my eyes at how often the mainstream media missed the mark, turning us all into broad stereotypes. And yet pop culture also seeded progressive ideas in my brain. I was a teenager when the first rumors that Ellen DeGeneres might be a lesbian, and that her sitcom character on the show Ellen might come out of the closet too, began to circulate. I bought the week’s Entertainment Weekly, which featured her, and read it carefully. Everything I’d been taught in church and from friends and family suggested that being gay was a terrible choice that some people made. But here was living proof that if you were going to “choose” to be gay, it probably wouldn’t be worth the hassle. DeGeneres’s name was being dragged through the mud endlessly by members of the religious right, and still she persisted with her plan to make her character the first gay lead character in American TV history. Well, I thought, she probably just is gay. She probably isn’t doing this for attention. It’s probably really important to her that she be allowed to be herself on her TV show. Still, I didn’t meet an out gay person until college. I lived in an incredibly small, incredibly homogeneous little town in South Dakota. I loved it, and love it still, but it didn’t present the best view of what the world is actually like. I didn’t really get to know a black person, or someone of Latino descent, or a Muslim, until many, many years later, when I moved to Milwaukee and later Southern California. My wife frequently remarks on how she, another small-town native, didn’t meet anyone who was Jewish until she was 25. I grew up in an environment that was kind, supportive, and nurturing. It was also incredibly cloistered. And as the 2016 presidential election approached, I saw friends from back home darkly ruminating on easily disproved rumors about how, say, the state of South Dakota was bringing in large cohorts of Syrian refugees and keeping them hidden in abandoned state facilities. Progressives understand but still underestimate how ensconced we are in a progressive bubble — and how all-encompassing the conservative bubble on the other side is as well. Can those bubbles be popped? I don’t know, but I’d like to hope so. Yes, we know Facebook is driving this isolation, but we can’t really contend with what it is to be someone who deeply believes himself to not be racist or homophobic or what have you — even if the policies he supports are racist or homophobic — and then feel as if everybody in America thinks that’s who you are. And we’ve barely begun to realize how much geography plays into this, how the diversity we see in America’s great urban centers has barely begun to spread into many rural areas. There’s nowhere to meet anymore, and progressive culture too often acts as if those who disagree with it are weird anomalies, not a major section of the country. Near the end of his terrific new book The End of White Christian America, Public Religion Research Institute CEO Robert P. Jones points to a quote from Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne calling white Protestantism the “civic and moral glue” that has held America together throughout much of its history. Jones writes: [White Protestantism] spun a coherent national narrative, cultivated a common vocabulary, served as an institutional intermediary between whole sectors of society such as business and government, and curated symbols of national life, all of which created a sense of strong civil solidarity. ... The passing of White Christian America presents a unique challenge, analogous to the death of the patriarch who served, for good and ill, at the center of family life. Standing beside the resting place of White Christian America, amidst unprecedented diversity and renewed racial tensions, it’s unclear what could provide a similar civic glue again. But on the left, at least, there’s an increasing attempt to create just that sort of civic glue sans religious affiliation. I call it progressive fundamentalism. (I’ll just state upfront here that progressive fundamentalism, by and large, is the province of upper-class white folks. It’s more diverse than your average Trump rally and getting more so every day — but probably not yet by as much as your average progressive fundamentalist would like.) Here’s how I define progressive fundamentalism: It’s the idea that a sort of mildly diverse, cosmopolitan near-liberalism has essentially “solved” society. It traffics in feel-good optimism about multiculturalism, nods toward forms of diversity that don’t actually confront what it means to make an equal society, and emphasizes broad cultural signifiers of what it means to be “good.” For much of the country, it’s best known through its pop cultural output, not what it really believes or stands for. Progressive fundamentalism’s primary defining characteristic is its urban cosmopolitanism, which means it includes a good number of economic conservatives who are socially moderate. But it at least flirts with real, open socialism every once in a while. (It maybe didn’t vote for Bernie Sanders, but it sure liked reading about his ideas.) A lot of it is performative, but I don’t mean that in the sense that progressives don’t genuinely care about, say, pop cultural diversity. Think of how many times you’ve read a piece about the importance of racially diverse casting in Hollywood projects (sometimes on this very website) — something that is, indeed, hugely important. But think about how often you’ve read an article about diversity behind the scenes, or in talent agencies, or atop the show business executive food chain. Then think about how often you’ve heard about diversity of class, or diversity of religion, or diversity of political perspective. Hollywood diversity goes only so far and largely reflects the views of those who are economically comfortable and live in Brentwood. The lack of outcry about this seems to suggest a slippage between what progressives want and the lived reality of many rural whites — even if that’s not true. Many white folks in the mainstream left — myself included — increasingly function in terms of making sure we follow the right rules and nod toward the right cultural signifiers: shopping at the right stores and watching the right TV shows and saying the right things in the right way. Do all of these things, and you will be saved, become woke. Foreign policy theorists have a concept of “soft power” — the idea that a country’s cultural output has influence that extends beyond its borders. To put it another (vastly simplified) way, American TV shows and movies sell a vision of the US to other countries that makes us seem cooler than we actually are. What’s happened in the cultural divide between progressive fundamentalists and the white Protestant remnants of our rural areas is sort of a mirror-universe version of America as it appears onscreen. Movies and TV shows and music sell that superficially diverse, seemingly equitable society I talked about earlier, and that world seems further and further away from the rural viewers who are supposed to live in the same country as those creating that entertainment. Think, for instance, of the Oscars So White movement. This was a huge deal for the online left, and justifiably so. It reflected how poor the film industry is at telling stories about the broad group of Americans out there who aren’t white. But if you’re not ensconced in progressive news sources and simply tuned in to the Oscars, the constant pushing on this point by host Chris Rock and others must have seemed a little bizarre. Of course the Oscars don’t reflect America, a rural white person might think. I don’t see anybody who looks or acts like me. That divide creates the subconscious sense that there’s a party somewhere that all these rural folks aren’t invited to — and everybody at the party is laughing at them, even as their towns grow more and more desperate, racked with economic pain, health crises, and opioid epidemics, problems that before 2016 were barely touched on at all in either conservative or progressive media. This idea comes up in every single book I’ve read about trying to understand the collapse of white, rural America. Put another way: I’m increasingly convinced that too many on the left want the appearance of being equitable, rather than actual equality. So long as the picture looks right, it doesn’t matter who’s excluded from it. Where the right longs endlessly for a past that never was, an unchaotic 1950s that largely exists in its head, the cultural left seems trapped in hopes of a future that leaves out everybody who disagrees with it, where everything is okay because we’ve embraced a surface-level diversity. It doesn’t realize how little its America looks like the America many others live in. And some of that, to be clear, is on older rural whites. It’s not my fault that they live in homogeneous enclaves and believe that my downtown Los Angeles home must be surrounded by constant crime and near anarchy. (It’s not.) It’s not my fault that in my hometown, at least, nonwhites who visited when I was a child were treated as, at best, exotic curiosities. But I think we progressive fundamentalists can find other ways of both defending our ideals and listening to those who disagree without reflexively dismissing their concerns. Progressive economic policies, again, largely benefit rural whites when compared with conservative ones, but the culture we make and consume, and the politics we express on our Facebook walls, often seem like they only have room for city dwellers, no matter how much that’s not true. Like religious fundamentalism, progressive fundamentalism, at the moment, is far more concerned with going through the motions of a so-called “good” life and belonging to the right movements than it is with actually trying to build relationships with people from outside of the fundamentalist core. We understand the problems of abject poverty, but only abstractly, largely through data or statistics. We have limited experience with what it means to actually live through such a thing, whether in a rural area or an urban center. Similarly, we understand that people who live well outside of our progressive fundamentalist, urban core are people, too, but only abstractly. When actually confronted with the messy realities — like the country electing Donald Trump president — we shut down just a little bit. We focus on the certainty we feel in our moral and philosophical codes and on that hoped-for future we expect will arrive any day now, but we ignore the very real pain and hurt going on in our own country. We can’t blame a nebulous “other” for Trump, not 100 percent. We were at fault, just a little bit. We treated him as a joke for a long, long time, and didn’t understand that treating him as a joke only gave him more power, because his core voters thought we were constantly mocking them all along. Let me tell you about where I grew up. If you imagine America as a person, Armour, South Dakota, is a bump, a tiny little speck on the skin. You can drive through it in about a minute, if the town cop isn’t there to stop you. My wife — whose hometown population numbered just 2,000 people — is quick to mock me for having grown up in Mayberry, and she’s not wrong. I describe it as a good place to be if you like to feel lonely, and I remember long post-school afternoons sitting on a green, humming electrical box, looking out over the endless horizon of my family’s farm. Main Street is emptier today than it was when I was a child, but those who still live in Armour have made worthy attempts to keep it lively. And the employment rate is stable, with most Armour residents driving to the nearby city (he said of a town with about 15,000 people) of Mitchell for work. Armour’s Main Street is no longer the center of any universe, but it has settled, at least somewhat peacefully, into being part of a solar system. What I remember most about it is a feeling of stability. Living in Armour was a little like living inside a chrysalis. On the outside, it appeared unchanging, maybe growing a little bit harder, a little bit less flexible. But on the inside, massive changes were in motion. Now, having moved away, I see the things my family didn’t talk about. Even in a town of 750 people or so, class distinctions were present. My family wasn’t absurdly rich or anything of the sort, but my parents had both gone to college and were insistent that my sister and I would go too, thanks to the money they set aside every month. We didn’t want for things. We had new clothes, and when I badly damaged the side of my dad’s pickup in an ill-considered tangle with a dumpster, it wasn’t the financial apocalypse it could have been. Beyond that, my family was stable. My parents loved each other, and they loved their children. We went to church every Sunday. My father’s parents lived just a few miles away, and my mother’s parents weren’t too far — just a 90-minute car ride. I grew up surrounded by people who loved me and cheered for me and wanted me to succeed. I know my parents wish I would move back home, but they’re also a little pleased to tell people their son lives in Los Angeles. There were others in town who didn’t have such comfort. I didn’t realize it at the time, but Armour was haunted by social schisms that threatened to swallow us. We were all white. We were all Christian. We were all Republican (except for a friend who bragged about his family being the only Democrats in town; he might have been right). But we were not the same, not by a long shot. A friend of mine, whose father owned a successful local business, lived in the biggest house any of us had ever seen. Anytime we visited someplace far away from our hometown — the top of the St. Louis arch, say — we’d joke that we could see his house from there. He would laugh but defensively say it wasn’t that big (which, objectively speaking, was true; it wasn’t a mansion or anything), and anyway, his dad had done a lot of the work to fix it up. Today, I understand that we weren’t just laughing in the good-natured way that teenage boys laugh at each other. We were also trying, subtly, to restore some sense of the social order. No one should be so successful, went the undercurrent of the joke. We believed in being rewarded for hard work, in God’s blessings. But our ribbing longed for redistribution. And we never talked about those who really did live in abject poverty, just a few miles away — the Native Americans who had once ruled the prairies we lived on and were now trapped in a reservation prison we all wanted to believe was a gift. In her book White Trash, scholar Nancy Isenberg convincingly argues that the roots of American social and economic class — inherited from our British ancestors — stretch all the way back to the 1500s. The book is nothing less than a suggestion that the beating down of poor, rural whites is one of many ancient sins that America can’t quite find it in its heart to do penance for. Reading Isenberg’s book made me realize, finally, how to talk about something I’ve always struggled to express. We Armourites were living right alongside a social caste system we didn’t dare discuss, but unlike the more obviously racist caste systems of other rural areas, this was one that the national media and government more or less accepted without question. I was lucky enough to have nice things, to have a shot at leaving South Dakota someday. Many of my peers did not. And we would never talk about it. We had our church and our schools and our social clubs. All of those institutions mediated the gap between have and have not. But we had our jokes, and our gossip, and our insinuations too. We built a shadow kingdom of resentment and anger, in hopes that our real one might remain upright and stable. I think we haven’t adequately grappled, as a nation, with what it means to go from white Protestant America to progressive fundamentalist America — from the small towns to the cities. Even as America has urbanized over the past two centuries, we maintain our national mythology around small towns. Certainly the growing pains associated with shifting from a solidly white majority to the majority-minority US that will arrive in 30 years or so are driving these anxieties, but so is the thought that the small town used to be the center of American discourse, even if that was mostly an illusion. Now it’s not even part of the conversation. So imagine you once lived in what seemed like a stable community, safe and predictable — or what it might be like to live in a place with a living memory of such a time. Beyond that, imagine that during this time, much of US popular culture seemed catered to making sure you felt validated in your life choices. As recently as the 1960s, film and television regularly told stories about rural America, and as recently as the 1990s, country music was seen as a vibrant, creative, explicitly traditionalist pop culture force. Now imagine that world fading — slowly at first, when the plant closed, or the family farmer couldn’t make ends meet, or the school consolidated with the one from the town next door. But then all of a sudden, it seemed to accelerate: businesses closing, kids moving away, opportunity dying, the best possible representation of your community on TV becoming Duck Dynasty, of all things. And in a country where you assumed white Protestantism was the center of everything, religion is suddenly just not a major factor in public life at all. Marriage equality is the law of the land, and the media insists you should be happy about it. Is the anger over the loss of that world driven by white supremacy and the patriarchy? Absolutely. But imagine yourself as that person again. You’d be freaked out too. In Strangers in Their Own Land, Hochschild hoped to understand how Louisianans whose lives had been hurt by the industrial pollution so rampant in the area could still support Republican politicians who wanted to slash government regulations. Her key finding — her “deep story,” she calls it — is that the people in these communities feel they’re being passed over, that their shot at the American dream is being taken by a whole bunch of people who don’t look and act like them: racial minorities, yes, but also city residents and LGBTQ citizens and even endangered animals. She imagines this feeling as a line, in which rural whites stand and wait while imagining that folks from other constituencies are cutting in ahead of them and being celebrated for doing so. The resulting discomfort and frustration is easiest to explain in terms of race and gender, and I don’t want to discount how this cultural anxiety has exploded, in ugly fashion, via racism and misogyny. But Hochschild also unpacks how completely the modern world has torn apart these rural communities, simply by existing. The people she interviews can remember the world as it was, the beauty of the Louisiana swamps and the communities there, and they can see what it has become. One man, in particular, just wants to have a place where his adult children, who have since moved away, can find work and live near him. We, all of us, live within systems we don’t realize are systems. Think of the way Earth stretches before you when you’re out somewhere open and wild, how it seems to be a flat plane that buildings and mountains and trees have been plopped down upon. Intellectually, you know it’s a sphere, that you are held to it by gravity. But to just see it, that’s not always obvious. And yet it would be obvious if gravity suddenly weakened, or if the Earth rapidly began to contract. The system you live in would reveal itself. The questions of why evangelical Christians would support Trump, or why people who live in communities that are so predominantly white would be so anti-refugee, or why older white evangelicals are still so resistant to marriage equality are just three different masks concealing  the same problem. Trump voters are people who suddenly realized — and I mean very rapidly, over a couple of decades — that the system they thought they lived in, where they thought they were at the center of the country’s power structures, isn’t the objective reality everybody else occupies, but rather a system that’s collapsing. Voting for Trump, then, isn’t just a cry of desperation. It’s the latest shot in a civil war where too many progressive fundamentalists have brought political comedy videos to a ballot fight. I would guess that I have very little in common, politically, with J.D. Vance, author of the best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy. The book is about his life growing up among the descendants of Scotch-Irish immigrants in Kentucky and Ohio, before joining the Marines and eventually graduating from Yale Law School. He’s quite obviously a political conservative, while I’m a liberal who’s uncomfortable with liberalism’s frequent timidity when it comes to remaking the American polity. But I found myself nodding, over and over, at his conclusion that even now, having left behind his childhood and moved into the professional, ruling class, he finds himself trying to understand his new world, to operate by rules that are simply assumed by those he meets in this world to be known. He finds himself in the unlikely position of translator, of trying to explain each world to the other and often becoming frustrated. His occasional feelings of inferiority in the face of this new life resonated deeply with me. And I was flabbergasted by how his tendency to either explode or completely retreat from conflict mirrors my own — and how he ties it to the rural past we share. I think, if I had the chance to talk with Vance, he would understand what I mean when I talk about progressive fundamentalism, even if he might disagree on the details. Progressive fundamentalism is just another system, one that you don’t realize is all around you until you step back. It’s one that encompasses those on the left and the right who would argue at length about supply-side economics but blanch at the thought of outlawing marriages between two people of the same sex. It believes it has answers, but it mostly has data. Indeed, if you only got a glimpse of progressive America through its pop cultural output, it would barely seem to care about economics, seemingly believing, on some level, that the kinder, gentler capitalism of the Clinton and Obama administrations has solved inequality — and anyway, a lot of the people who are stuck on the less equal side of the ledger believe obviously inaccurate things. Those who subscribe to progressive fundamentalism confuse their beliefs for a solution because they embrace the cosmopolitan world those beliefs thrive in. They tend to view other solutions — older ways of thinking — as outmoded and outdated, as something that should be scrapped. They may not immediately consider themselves to be part of a clash between civilizations, between a new America centered on progressive fundamentalism and an old America centered on white Protestantism, but everybody who’s still living in the latter believes in that war, and sometimes rides that belief to gigantic electoral outcomes. This discrepancy is what Vance and Hochschild and Jones and Isenberg and myself are all fretting over in the end. How do you translate messages between two different countries that share the same set of borders? For as much as I needle it, I do believe the cosmopolitan, more open, more diverse nature of progressive fundamentalism is a necessary improvement on the homogeneous nature of the old America. And it’s not as if issues like marriage equality are something I’ll compromise on. Both Republicans and Democrats have fooled themselves, since the ’80s, into thinking American politics is an argument about how nice capitalism should be, when to a lot of people it’s about whether some of us should even exist. Progressive fundamentalism, to use a religious metaphor, is lousy at witnessing for itself. It assumes that by looking cool on TV, it can win over those of us who could leave our small towns and move to a coast or major city. It assumes it doesn’t need to share the core tenets of its theology if it seems like a cool party. But there are a lot of people left behind without the money or means to escape, people who might have once been receptive to these ideas but are now stuck. And they curdle. Let me tell you about where I live now. Downtown Los Angeles is the culmination of a dream I had when I was 15, when I realized that all of the time I spent watching TV might someday be put to good use. Believe me, that I get paid to watch television isn’t lost on me as a kind of cruel joke the universe has played on everybody who doesn’t get to do the same. This fact inevitably comes up anytime I engage in Facebook arguments with people from back home — about Syrian refugees or transgender bathroom rights or anything else. They scoff at the thought that I could write about TV and get paid for it. But I do! And I live in a neighborhood with some of the best restaurants and nightlife in the country. We’ve got an amazing movie theater coming, and if I left my apartment at 2 in the morning, there would be people around, everywhere I went, who similarly want to share in my neighborhood’s bounty. We might smile at each other. We got out! our glimpses might say. We made it! But did we? Or did we trade one seemingly oppressive system for a completely different one? Because let me tell you more about where I live now. If I leave my apartment and turn a different direction, I’ll walk right into the heart of Skid Row, right into the heart of poverty so absolute that the brain’s automatic response is to try to shut it out. I drive through it often, watching this shadow society exist alongside my own, this place full of people who are my neighbors but who are ignored by so many as an inconvenience. And as downtown LA gentrifies, the boundaries of Skid Row tighten a little more with each new year. There’s a skirmish on the horizon, between the progressive, gentrified world downtown LA is becoming and this place that has stood, for decades, as a community for those who have lost everything. These are the faces not presented in the progressive fundamentalist version of Los Angeles. Yes, we might talk about the homeless problem in the abstract, or donate a little money to a charity. But someday it will become inconvenient to our newly gleaming edifices, and it and the people who live there will be washed away. Remember the Jesusland map? It circulated widely online after the 2004 election, when George W. Bush narrowly squeaked out reelection over Democratic nominee John Kerry, thanks largely to religious conservative voters, who were driven to the polls by a slew of anti–marriage equality measures. (The race was more complicated, of course, but that was the story that spun up in the immediate aftermath of the election.) It was an honest, if bitter, reaction to a hard-fought contest that ended in the reelection of a bad president, who was reelected (in this argument) almost entirely because of bullshit cultural allegiances. But it also catalyzed, for me, how swiftly the left’s reaction to rural whites had gone from, at worst, “They’re a little misguided,” to, “No, these people are fucking idiots.” And again, maybe that’s where we want to go. I disagree with the people I grew up with on just about everything — whether political or social or cultural. Maybe the answer is just to go all in on the Democratic Party, maximize turnout of nonwhite voters and millennials in every election cycle, and hope time and demographic shifts will save us all. It didn’t work in 2016, but Hillary Clinton did still win a convincing popular vote victory. Maybe this strategy will work in 2020. However, I’d like to think progressive fundamentalists could articulate our values more effectively — and convince those who don’t share them to actually listen. It’s absolutely necessary to call out the racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ sentiments inherent to many of the beliefs held by Trump and his surrogates, and we should be vigilant in doing so, at all times. But I think there are places where we can listen, too, and admit that on some of these points of wider cultural anxiety, there’s ample room for empathy. I’d like to think we could step forward not in the spirit of, “I have all the answers,” but in the spirit of, “I want to hear about your problems.” When I started digging into the rumor I mentioned above that Syrian refugees were hiding out in an abandoned government facility in South Dakota, just to see where it came from, just to see if it was as racist as it seemed to be (and it was), everybody I talked to said some variation on the same thing: The people spreading this rumor might be angry and bitter and a little bit racist, but they’re good people. Really. To be honest, that sentiment seems to contradict itself. Those who peddle dark conspiracy theories driven by racial paranoia would seem to not be blameless by simple virtue of doing, well, that. The more I thought about it and continued talking to people, the more I realized that what they meant was maybe the rumormongers weren’t always good people, but their defenders hoped they still could be. There exists some universe where we can all talk about these things, where we can remember that we’re all Americans, going over the cliff together. This, in a nutshell, is the American small-town ideal — the mythological apex we aspire to. But if Trump’s election proved anything to me, it’s that this vision of the small town where everybody (who’s white) can come together and have a chat about what’s troubling them is over. It’s increasingly a lie, a place that’s been lost beneath waves of bitter, vituperative backlash. The place dubbed Jesusland has lashed right back out to paint the (urban, progressive) world I live in as soft and “too PC.” And, pardon my French, fuck that. Progressive fundamentalism has many, many, many faults, but it also has a compelling, competing vision of what America can and should be. That it has spent so much time trying to figure out how to understand rural America in the past year is, to me, a sign of its strength. It makes room for everyone at the table, and it believes the stories of all people have inherent value and interest. It might not always live up to those ideals — and it needs to find a way to let rural whites know they are a part of its vision without compromising its larger ideals of diversity — but I’ll be damned if I’m going to be told that those ideals aren’t worth holding in the first place, that those ideas shouldn’t be the future of this country. Our lives are beautiful and American too, but we do a lousy job of selling the emotion of that, the — dare I say it — patriotism of that. We’re lousy at owning up to our weak spots too. True political change comes from relationship building. Just look at how rapidly opinions on marriage equality changed as more Americans came to know the LGBTQ people in their midst. We should work to get better at building those relationships, at telling our stories. There are aspects of the old social order, now lost, worth mourning. Were there terrible things about it? Yes. Many. But there were also communities of people looking out for each other, places where you could feel like you knew yourself and everyone around you. I miss the one I grew up in every day — which may, to you, mark all of the above as a bunch of horseshit. But I do believe there’s nothing wrong with stability, or with faith. We are all struggling toward the same answers and hoping for the same things. We just want to be understood, and we just want to be loved. And I still believe the best way to build the world we want is to invite others in — even if they reject it, again and again. Progressives keep trying, because our America makes room for everybody, and it can make room for those who are receptive to its message in rural, white America too, if we can only bridge that communication gap. That’s not soft. That’s the biggest, strongest ideal this country has ever had. Let’s make America great again.

        "articles": "Trump managed to accomplish very little on health care, despite Republicans’ decade-long obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act. Mere days before his 2016 election to the presidency, Donald Trump boldly promised his voters: “When we win on November 8th and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.” Now Trump is on his way out of the White House, and the health care law is still standing. Trump, who had promised on the campaign trail to deliver “great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost — and it’s going to be so easy,” quickly realized how wrong he was. Republican congressional attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act consumed most of Trump’s first year in office. They wanted to deliver on a years-long obsession with undoing the previous president’s signature legislative achievement. The repeal push ultimately failed with Sen. John McCain’s thumbs-down in July 2017. Though Republicans said they would make a second attempt that fall, it quickly sputtered and never came up for a vote. Trump and Republicans failed to figure how to satisfy the outsized promises they had made. Rather than make health insurance more affordable, their plans would have shrunk federal assistance and hiked premiums for millions. Rather than cover everybody, as Trump said he wanted to do, millions of people would have lost their insurance. Rather than protect Medicaid, as the president pledged he would, their proposals would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending and led to millions falling off its rolls. People with preexisting conditions would have lost the iron-clad protections that Obamacare had given them, that they would not be denied coverage or charged a higher premium because of their medical history. “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated,” Trump said just one month into his term. The Trump White House paid the price for its miscalculation. Democrats, campaigning heavily on preserving health care, won back the House in the 2018 midterms. The GOP’s Senate majority was lost in 2020. Biden pummeled Trump over his health care agenda and made the latter a one-term president. Not every president passes a landmark health care bill, as Barack Obama did. But Republicans swept into power four years ago having promised to fix what they said Obama had broken. Trump said he would not only repeal and replace Obamacare, but he’d put into place ambitious plans to bring down drug prices. The Covid-19 pandemic response was a disaster, with 400,000 Americans now dead, and the repercussions will be felt for years. That will be Trump’s legacy more than any affirmative steps his administration took to change US health care. As Trump surrenders power, what’s remarkable is how little of a mark he will leave on American health care. “We spent four years waiting to see Trump’s health care plan, which may or may not have ever existed,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “His promise of ‘great’ health care was certainly never realized.” The denouement to Trump’s failed health care record should come later this year when the US Supreme Court, of which he’s appointed a third of the members, is expected to reject the latest challenge to the ACA — a lawsuit that the Trump administration had supported. Biden begins his term looking to quickly build on the ACA, expanding the welfare state that the outgoing president tried so hard but failed to shrink. There are still serious problems in US health care: tens of millions still uninsured and medical care left unaffordable for many others who do have an insurance card. But Biden will pick up where Obama left off, almost as if the Trump administration never happened. Legislation is the surest way to change US public policy for good, and Trump’s most comprehensive health care plans failed to pass Congress. Even though Republicans did succeed in repealing the individual mandate as part of their tax bill, experts were around the same time concluding that the mandate was not as essential to the law functioning as previously believed. Obamacare enrollment stayed mostly steady in the first year after the mandate penalty was zeroed out. Trump’s record on health care is largely his administrative actions — and those are most vulnerable to being undone by the courts or the incoming Biden administration. Many of his most significant achievements already appear to be at risk. The Trump administration approved, for the first time in history, Medicaid work requirements in several states, conditioning a person’s eligibility for health insurance on whether they are working or looking for work. But those requirements were blocked by the courts, which questioned whether they met Medicaid’s objectives as it quickly became clear that thousands of people would lose coverage. The Supreme Court will hear a lawsuit challenging Medicaid work requirements in the coming year, and legal experts actually believe there is a chance the conservative-leaning high court will side with the lower courts and block work requirements from taking effect. Alongside the Obamacare case, the justices could spell the end to another one of Trump’s health care priorities. A sense of desperation clearly kicked in during the final months of Trump’s term. Trump’s No. 2 health official, Seema Verma, worked overtime in the final days of the administration to ensconce some of the administration’s agenda for Medicaid. A waiver to establish Medicaid spending caps in Tennessee, also known as block grants, was approved, as were waivers proposed by conservative governors in Tennessee and Florida. The problem, according to experts, is that these Medicaid waivers are approved at the discretion of the federal government. The Biden administration is not going to be friendly toward work requirements or block grants. Verma has tried to put in place procedural barriers to unwinding these last-minute approvals, but the consensus of experts is that Biden should be able to reverse them, though it will surely take time and a lot of paperwork. Some of Trump’s other actions — such as cutting Obamacare outreach funding — can be nixed with the stroke of a pen. Others, like various plans to cut drug prices, have been proposed but never finalized as regulations and therefore will not actually take effect unless Biden takes them across the finish line. This shoddy legal and regulatory work has exposed Trump’s health care policies to being quickly and permanently nullified. Even his administration’s most successful action could be weakened if Biden succeeds in passing the Covid-19 stimulus plan he has proposed. Having failed to repeal Obamacare, the Trump health department proposed and did actually finalize a regulation expanding short-term limited-duration insurance. Those plans are not subject to the ACA’s rules about preexisting conditions and, under these new regulations, they would be allowed to last as long as three years. Trump officials portrayed them as a cheaper, free-market alternative to Obamacare, though their sales have been plagued by misleading marketing, and patients have sometimes found that these plans do not provide the level of coverage they were led to believe. Nevertheless, enrollment in those plans did grow under Trump, up to about 3 million consumers, according to the best estimates. The merits could be debated, but the impact was real. When I asked health policy experts about what Biden could do administratively to change health care, I was surprised when several of them said they weren’t sure whether he would be able to reverse Trump’s expansion of short-term plans. Their thinking was that the Biden team might be hesitant to yank those plans, cheap and substandard though they are, away from people without giving them an alternative. But then Democrats won both Georgia Senate runoffs, and with them control of the Senate, and suddenly Biden’s legislative agenda had some life. As part of his Covid-19 stimulus plan, Biden is proposing to make Obamacare’s premium assistance more generous and to make more people eligible for it. People might be more willing to drop a short-term plan and sign up for Obamacare if those proposals pass and ACA-compliant plans are cheaper. There was one Trump policy that Levitt thought could leave a lasting impression: new requirements that health care providers and insurers disclose more data about the prices paid for medical services. But there’s a twist. “The data that will become available could shine a spotlight on how high prices are and how much they vary,” he said. “Perhaps ironically, Trump’s market-oriented price transparency regulation could help build support for more regulatory approaches to deal with high costs.” We have a request In moments like this — as people grapple to understand variants and vaccines, and kids head back to school — many outlets take their paywalls down. ’s content is always free, in part because of financial support from our readers.

        "articles": "Hugo Drochon's new book on Nietzsche can teach us about American populism and European disintegration. Normally, a book about Nietzsche’s political theory would not be of interest to general audiences, but against the backdrop of Brexit and Donald Trump, I suspect it will be. One reason is that Nietzsche anticipated our current cultural and political climate. From his late 19th-century perch, he warned that Europe’s increasingly democratic states would fall into parochialism and mass hysteria. He even condemned Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian statesman who unified Germany in 1871, for cementing his power by stoking nationalist resentments and appealing to racial purity. Despite Nietzsche’s pointed, if sporadic, political commentary, there’s a debate among scholars about the political relevance of his thought. On the one side are those who think Nietzsche’s concerns were largely apolitical. If you comb through his texts, you don’t find much that speaks directly to traditional political concerns. And when he does touch the political, it’s never in any systematic way; there’s no unified theory. On the other side (confession: I’m on this side) are those who see in Nietzsche a deeply political thinker. It’s true that much of his writing is about morality and the role of art in society. But if you believe, as I do, that ethics and culture are inseparable from politics, Nietzsche’s ideas are inescapably political. The school that counts Nietzsche as an important political thinker is now one scholar bigger. Hugo Drochon is a postdoctoral researcher at Cambridge University and the author of a new book called Nietzsche’s Great Politics, Drochon’s approach is to make sense of Nietzsche’s broader political thought by focusing on what he had to say about the politics of his time. Nietzsche saw Bismarck’s vulgar “blood and soil” politics as a harbinger of things to come. It was the beginning of a period of great transformation in Europe. There was a debate about the future of the continent, and Nietzsche perceived a shift into a form of “petty politics” of the sort pioneered by Bismarck. Nietzsche hoped for a grand unification of Europe, a trans-national politics in which high culture and art could thrive. What he witnessed instead was more fragmentation, more nationalism, more tribalism. Drochon argues that Nietzsche develops frameworks to analyze these transformations that could help us think differently about the “unraveling we’re seeing today” in Europe and North America. In December, I sat down with Drochon to talk about his new book. I also asked him about Nietzsche’s reputation as a nihilist, the significance of his “God is dead” proclamation, and what his political musings might teach us about our current political drama. One of the things I hear most from people about Nietzsche is that he was a “nihilist” or an advocate of nihilism. But the reverse is true. Nietzsche diagnosed nihilism; he didn’t celebrate it. He saw a crisis of culture brewing and tried to point the way forward. Why was he so worried about nihilism? I completely share your point about Nietzsche not being a nihilist. He was responding to the specter of nihilism that was haunting Europe at the time. First, we have to remember that Nietzsche was the theorist of the \"death of God.\" He said we used to live our lives according to a transcendent morality that everybody could agree on, but if nobody agrees on that anymore, then we have to confront, really confront, the challenge of relativism. I want to linger on Nietzsche’s “God is dead” thesis for a second because I think it’s arguably the most important thing he said, and probably the least understood. There’s this idea that Nietzsche gleefully pronounced God’s death, but the next sentence after that line reads, “And we have killed Him.” For Nietzsche, it was a terrible thing that this had happened. “Since Copernicus,” he wrote, “man has been rolling away from the center towards X.” That “X” was the abyss opened up by the collapse of this belief that earth was the center of things, that history had a direction or that humanity held a privileged place in the cosmos. How do you understand this phrase “God is dead” and why did you think Nietzsche considered it such a monumental event? Well, I think we have to first remember the context. This was the late 19th century and Nietzsche was talking specifically about the Christian God, or the idea of a monotheistic god. And he was referring to the values that had sprung up in the Western world which had their roots in this monotheistic tradition. The death of God meant simply that no one really believes in this anymore. They carry on as though they do, but science and reason had completely undercut the metaphysical claims of monotheism, which is to say the idea of absolute moral truth. What we learned was that life was always in the process of becoming. For Nietzsche, God may have died in this sense, but we were still living in his shadow. And this meant that people no longer believed in God but were living as if God were still alive. Nietzsche really wanted to challenge those types of people. He wanted to force them to reckon with the consequences of this. The claim here wasn’t that there could be no morality or values; rather, it was that we had lost the transcendent justification for the Judeo-Christian worldview, and that the moral implications of this extended well beyond religion. Precisely. One of the more jarring predictions that comes out of Nietzsche’s discussions about the death of God was that the next century would be defined by these grand ideological battles — that we’d have competing “isms” struggling to assert a new meaning and direction for history. I wonder how you think about that as a political theorist? Nietzsche predicts what he calls \"wars to determine the future of mankind,\" which will take place in the shadow of God. And his reasoning is that the death of God reopens the question of what we want humankind to be. Before, in the West at least, we had a Christian answer to this, a Christian conception of the good man. But if we don't believe in that anymore, or if we can't justify belief in that anymore, we have to take up this question yet again. And Nietzsche believed the next centuries would consist of wars over what the answer to that question ought to be. And these grand “isms” that dominated the 20th century — communism and fascism in particular — are very much the kind of political religions Nietzsche anticipated, right? That's right. These are attempted answers at this question of what mankind ought to become, but they're still stuck in the shadow of God for Nietzsche, and that's because they're still founded in these unchallengeable dogmas — about history, about human nature, about the future. These are all mistaken insofar as they claim their vision of morality or politics is the only one possible, the only true one. What the death of God made clear, or should have made clear, is that there are no absolutes. What he wanted to say is that there can be many different ways of existing, and societies should be organized in such a way that they allow for the possibility of many types of existences and not insist that there must be one answer, one truth, one morality. My sense is that Nietzsche did not believe humanity would move beyond this impulse for totalizing answers to questions about morality or history or higher meaning. We’re creatures that demand a higher meaning for our actions, and if one doesn’t exist, we’ll fabricate it. Well, Nietzsche is always talking to two different audiences. He grants that a lot of people need a kind of existential banister, some philosophy or belief system that grounds them in historical time, and that's fine. But his point is that these people should not be allowed to say that everyone needs to live according to these rules, and that there should be space for people who have the courage to face the fact that the world is in flux, and they should be allowed to experiment with different forms of living. To the extent he was concerned with politics, it was for this reason: to protect individuals from the totalizing tendencies of dogma — be it religious or political or ideological. That’s absolutely right. He asked how we might develop institutions that would defend the individual in society against pressures of mass culture. Let’s try to connect some of this to contemporary politics. What’s the thesis of your book about Nietzsche and why is it relevant? The conceit of the book was to ask if Nietzsche talked about the politics of his day, and if he does talk about the politics of his day, is this an entry point into trying to think about what his broader politics would be. The answer, of course, is yes. He talks quite a bit about the politics of his time. Most of his writings are critical, and we can talk about why that is, but what he does offer is a vision of what a truly great modern politics would look like. And that vision includes a grand unification of Europe and a transcendence of petty nationalisms. What he hopes for is the emergence of a kind of trans-European elite that can lead this cultural and political revolution. What I say in the book is that Nietzsche is writing at a time in which you could see changes in European politics that announce other things that would happen in the 20th century: the explosion of democracy, the extension of suffrage, there are emergent questions about European politics and a balance of power. My claim is that the conceptual tools he develops to talk about these transformations offer a unique way of thinking about the unraveling we're seeing today, especially as it relates to Brexit and, more recently, Donald Trump. You don’t really write about Trump in the book, but you’ve suggested elsewhere that he’s a sort of caricature of Nietzsche’s idea of the ubermensch (often mistranslated at “superman”). Is that right? Well I've heard it said that Trump may represent some approximation of Nietzsche's ubermensch, and I think that's deeply mistaken. But the reasons why it's mistaken can help us think about what Trump actually is. First, it's wrong because Trump represents everything Nietzsche hated. The philistinism, the mediocrity, the worshipping of money for its own sake — this is exactly the opposite of what Nietzsche advocated. By ubermensch, Nietzsche meant someone who could live beyond good and evil, beyond conventional values, who refused to appeal to herd instincts. There's a passage in Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra in which he talks about the ubermensch, and I think it's quite relevant. Zarathustra, the protagonist, comes down from his mountain retreat and tells the people in the town square that he's going to teach them about the ubermensch, about what mankind should become, and the people are having none of it. They don't want to hear that they’ve stopped believing in God; that life is chaos; that nothing lasts; that they’re living in illusion. Zarathustra realizes the people are too decadent to hear this and so he decides instead to teach them about the \"Last Man.\" And the “Last Man” is the kind of person who doesn't want to think, who fears progress, who is risk-averse and desirous of comfort, who just wants everything to stay the same. Of course, the people erupt in joy when they hear this because this is what they really want. This is what Trump is to me. This is what he represents. He's a kind of \"Last Man\" demagogue, telling the people that he's going make things great again, which is to say simple and how they once were — and they love him for it. For Nietzsche, the celebration of a man like Trump was the inevitable result of a democratic culture built on the virtues of ignorance and self-fulfillment. Part of what’s going on in that text, and really in all of Nietzsche’s texts, is a protest against the decadence of democratic culture, and certainly it’s hard not to think of Trump in this context when revisiting Nietzsche’s ideas. Absolutely. Nietzsche spent a lot of time thinking about decadence and resentment, and how it manifests in society. For Nietzsche, culture has to do with overcoming yourself, and anything that is static and non-moving is the death of culture. All this nostalgia and looking back you see from Trump supporters is poisonous to culture for Nietzsche because it stunts any possibility of progress. I want to talk more about Trump, but it may help to zoom back a bit and talk about Nietzsche’s broader political thought. He’s often regarded as a non-political thinker, but I’ve never agreed with that. Culture is perhaps his first concern, but he insists that culture is bound up with politics, and so how a society organizes itself politically matters a great deal. You're right about this tendency to say Nietzsche isn't a political thinker. I also agree with you that this is wrong. For Nietzsche, there's a clear link between politics and culture in the sense that certain political systems support or produce certain kinds of cultures. What did Nietzsche hate about modernity and modern culture and how does someone like Trump reflect his critiques? Or maybe a better way to get at this is to ask: What was Nietzsche attacking in his own time and what are the analogues today? If you look at Nietzsche's writings in his own time, which is the end of the 19th century, the main figure is Bismarck. Of course, there's a huge difference between Trump and Bismarck, but Nietzsche's critique of Bismarck is still applicable to the type of critiques you might want to make of Trump. A key term I use in the book is \"great politics.\" Both Trump and Bismarck were obsessed with this notion of greatness. Nietzsche hated Bismarck's \"great politics\" for the same reasons many people hate Trump's politics: It's rooted in fragmentation, nationalism, xenophobia — the kind of things you might associate with Trump today. Nietzsche despised this insofar as it represented an appeal to popular resentment, to what he called herd instincts. I think it’s clear already, but it’s worth clarifying: Why was Nietzsche so contemptuous of democracy? Nietzsche didn't have much experience with democracy, so he has a kind of skewed view. That said, he's critical of democracy because he thinks of it is a leveling device, as a rejection of natural hierarchies. He believed certain people are destined for a life of culture and others aren’t, and democracy, in his mind, was a mechanism for the destruction of higher culture. You mentioned “resentment” a minute ago and of course Nietzsche is known as a philosopher of “resentment.” As you know, there’s a wave of anti-establishment sentiment sweeping across Europe and the United States. What’s the Nietzschean interpretation of this moment? A term I use in the book is \"misarchism,\" which is a rejection or hatred of authority. Nietzsche sees it as a uniquely democratic mindset. In some ways, this is positive because you need a level of criticism in society. But it can also go too far, and Nietzsche's view was that, over time, misarchism would tend towards the extreme. And I think that is where we are today — there's a rejection of elites, of the establishment, of authority itself. This is dangerous because there's a kind of nihilism behind it. There's not really a positive project that comes out of it. It's just a resounding \"no\" and it's not clear what comes next. You’re careful in the book to say that Nietzsche’s worldview is blinkered in its own way, but that he does give us an analytical framework that is applicable to our own time. That's right. I do think Nietzsche gives us concepts which can help us make sense of what's going on. His notion of resentment is certainly one of these concepts. Resentment, for Nietzsche, always starts with a rejection of the other. And this is what we’ve seen both in the UK and obviously in America with Trump’s campaign, which is wrapped up in white nationalism. We can, of course, argue about the causes of the resentment, but there’s no question that it’s there and that it’s fueling the populist reactionaries. Nietzsche has this great line about not looking into the abyss lest it look back, and I can't help but think we've done just that. It’s just not clear to me what’s on the other side of this wave we’re seeing. People are losing faith in the authority of governing institutions and they’re too busy throwing them off to worry about what follows. I don’t see how this ends well. Are you more optimistic about our political future? Well, I think that's a great way of putting it: Look into the abyss and the abyss looks back. All of this is definitely a big wake up call for people who consider themselves liberals. We know the world has changed, and we can't go back to the way it was before. So now we need to have the strength to look at what's happening and be able to formulate something that can come out of it. We have to resist this regression into a petty, fragmented brand of politics rooted in resentment and fear. But you're right to put it the way you did: We're staring into an abyss and we need to stare back and try to propose something positive. This is the main challenge for the 21st century.

        "articles": "Trump’s best hope is to convince opponents he’s more popular than he actually is. Outside contributors' opinions and analysis of the most important issues in politics, science, and culture. These are disorienting times for American democracy. Key features of a democratic nation — that the candidate who wins the majority has the right to rule, that elections are free from outside influence, and that political actions reflect the views of the majority of citizens — are all in question. The newly elected president has historically low approval levels, as does the newly convened Republican-led Congress. And key features of their political agenda — repealing the Affordable Care Act, reducing taxes for the rich, restricting access to abortion, inaction on climate change, opposing minimum wage increases — are all opposed by majorities of the American public. Our second president, John Adams, coined the phrase the “tyranny of the majority” to express his concern that majority-rule politics could trample the interests and rights of minority groups. Today we face a different challenge. Even though the majority of Americans do not support their agenda, Republicans will soon control all three branches of the federal government while also holding tremendous power at the state level. What can politicians and citizens do to resist this powerful but unpopular regime, to ensure majority sentiment is represented? Social science research on the dynamics of social norms, by myself and others, provides a variety of insights. This research fills an important gap, because while many post-election analyses have highlighted the causes of our undemocratic moment — the Electoral College, gerrymandering, and the diffusion of \"fake news,\" among them — it is much less clear what action the majority of Americans should take, as they find themselves governed by politicians pushing an agenda they do not support. Social scientists say that an “unpopular norm” exists when people perceive a view or behavior to have popular support when it is actually opposed by the majority. An unpopular norm is on view in the Hans Christian Anderson fable in which an entire village pretends to see a naked emperor’s nonexistent new clothes, falsely believing that everyone else can see them. Though you might assume unpopular norms are unusual, studies show they are actually quite common. Examples range from undergraduates overestimating the popularity of binge drinking on college campuses to citizens within repressive regimes underestimating the dissatisfaction of their peers. In a situation where the ruling minority asserts, falsely, that it represents the desires of the majority, what can politicians and citizens do to ensure that the true majority sentiment is represented? Most critically, the majority position must consistently broadcast that theirs is the more popular view. The key factor driving unpopular norms is the misperception of public opinion. Wherever possible, reliable data on the true majority sentiment should be brought to the table and emphasized relentlessly. Journalists have a role to play in making sure that false impressions of the public’s political views do not take root. Since the election, a view has emerged of Donald Trump as a clever and evasive politician who is able to upend existing policies and standards of decorum without consequence. But this narrative is false. Trump has taken a significant hit in the polls for pursuing an unpopular agenda. Where incoming presidents typically gain support following the election, Trump has lost support. Amazingly, he entered office with roughly half the favorability that Barack Obama did in 2008 — 40 percent versus 79 percent. Trump often asserts that he is overwhelmingly popular, claiming that he lost the popular vote only because millions of votes for Hillary Clinton were cast illegally. But there is no evidence for this claim. In fact, he squeaked into office based on the quirkiness of the Electoral College. The true story of the public’s perception of Donald Trump is not one featuring an easily distracted nation accepting outrageous behavior, but instead of widespread rejection of an incoming president and his agenda. Second, the majority must be deeply committed. Norms don’t just exist; they are made. And making them requires commitment. In my own research, my co-authors and I find that a minority of \"true believers\" who not only express their views but also seek to convert others can be critical to the emergence of an unpopular norm. Thus, an inequality of political will can be a critical factor driving the emergence of an unpopular regime (a dynamic captured by the W.B. Yeats line, “The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity”). But this can be undone where the minority's will is met with equal or greater determination from the majority. In practical terms, this means not just maintaining one's views but also working to spread them through grassroots campaigns, contacting legislators, organizing for candidates and ballot initiatives, and engaging in effective protests and persuasive conversations with other citizens. Additionally, the majority must never “move on” by assimilating to the reigning minority, thereby losing sight of the political injustice inherent in minority rule. Democratic institutions tend to be “self-justifying”: Because they are the result of elections, we assume they must represent the will of the people. Viewing officeholders as unpopular and, in President Trump’s case, possibly elected illegitimately produces cognitive dissonance, more than most can comfortably maintain. There is a tendency to reduce this dissonance through cognitive distortion, by simply concluding that these figures and their policies are in fact popular, legitimate, and acceptable. Instead, the injustice of the situation should be seen for what it is. The majority should resolve the dissonance by changing the facts on the ground, not in their minds. Resisting such cognitive distortion is particularly critical since the misperception of majority sentiment can easily become self-fulfilling. For example, the research on undergraduates' perceptions of drinking norms noted above found that the majority of students initially found themselves uncomfortable with campus binge drinking. Falsely assuming that they were in the minority, however, they gradually adjusted their views to put them more closely in line with what they assumed most of their peers thought. An imagined norm can easily become real. Finally, voice matters. The Vietnam War was not as unpopular as we assume it was. But those protesting the war were easier to see — whether on the streets or on the evening news — leading people to draw inaccurate inferences about the scope of disapproval of the war. Indeed, one of the strategic goals of social activism is to shape the public's perception of how widespread a view is. It's little surprise that the size of public protests is a significant predictor of their political influence. It's hard to stand up to an apparent majority. An unpopular regime that nonetheless attains power develops a persuasiveness that is outsize. People feel a strong pull to agree with what they believe most people think, and people fear speaking out against views they assume are held by a powerful majority. But unpopularity is the Trump regime's — indeed every unpopular regime's — greatest weakness. While the alienation many feel now can breed hopelessness and apathy, these feelings are misplaced. Recall the end of the Anderson fable, in which a child laughs at the naked emperor, triggering a cascade of nonconformity that undoes the spell. Unpopular regimes rest on a fragile foundation. Their legitimacy can be undermined if the true majority reveals itself. Above all else, in order to resist the tyranny of the minority, the majority must remember the strength of its numbers.

        "articles": "If paid for with spending cuts, the bill leaves 71.6 percent of Americans worse off. Officially, the tax bill passed by the US Senate in the early morning hours of December 2 costs $1.45 trillion over 10 years, or $1 trillion after taking into account its effect on economic growth. Those are the numbers of the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s official arbiter of tax figures, but skeptics like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget have argued that the true cost is substantially higher. If the many temporary provisions of the bill are made permanent (and Republican senators have insisted they will make them permanent), the true cost is more like $1.6 trillion to $2 trillion, and it continues to mount after 10 years are up. That bill has to be paid for, somehow. Congress could keep rolling over the debt, yes, but historical experience suggests that tax cuts are typically paid for by tax hikes in the future. Republicans have suggested they want to finance the cuts by slashing entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and food stamps. “We're going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a radio interview on Wednesday. Whether you pay for the $1.5 trillion through tax hikes or spending cuts, that financing changes who ultimately wins and loses under the bill. And a new study by the Tax Policy Center suggests that when you take financing into account, the vast majority of Americans lose out. Republicans haven’t put out any specifics about the Social Security, Medicare, and other spending cuts they want to use to reduce the deficit. So TPC's William Gale, Surachai Khitatrakun, and Aaron Krupkin present a number of options for how the burden of the spending cuts could be distributed: I should say that the first of these options is, by far, the most likely. The US doesn’t spend a lot of money directly on rich people; our benefits to the affluent tend to come through the tax code, through provisions like lower rates on capital gains, or through the mortgage interest and charitable deductions. That makes scenario 3, which assumes massive cuts to spending programs that benefit the rich, a bit fanciful. More to the point, Republicans’ efforts to cut spending have focused almost exclusively on programs for the poor, like Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income or food stamps. President Trump’s budget proposal includes $2.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, Affordable Care Act subsidies, food stamps, Social Security Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income, and cash welfare (TANF). That would go a long way toward paying for tax cuts, and its impact would be even more concentrated on the poor than in scenario 1, where spending is cut equally per capita. Gale, Khitatrakun, and Krupkin find that the overall distributional impact of the tax cuts depends wildly on which of the scenarios they considered occurs. Here’s the Senate bill, as financed by a $1,210-per-household cut in government spending: With spending cuts incorporated into the analysis, the bill turns into a rather shocking tax hike on the poor and middle class. The poorest fifth of Americans face an 8.1 percent cut in their income due to loss of government benefits (likely in the form of programs like food stamps and Medicaid). The middle fifth of Americans would be $370 worse off per year. The rich, however, and particularly the 95to to 99th percentiles (households that earn $308,200 to $746,100 a year) get substantial tax cuts still, because $1,210 just isn't a whole lot next to their overall income. The TPC also modeled what share of households would gain or lose under this plan: If the bill is financed this way, 71.6 percent of Americans would be worse off, including 99.9 percent of the poorest Americans. By contrast, large majorities of the richest Americans, in particular the 95th to 99th percentiles, would be better off. If the cuts are proportional to income (which, again, I think is a much less plausible modeling scenario than equal per-household spending cuts), and every household is 1.6 percent of income worse off due to the financing, then 63.9 percent of Americans wind up with a tax increase, including 93.4 percent of the poorest Americans. That’s a little better than the first scenario, but not much. If the cuts are proportional to income tax burden, and concentrated among the richest Americans who pay the most income taxes, the results are, unsurprisingly, progressive. In that scenario, 65.2 percent of Americans would get a tax cut, while 81 percent of the top 0.1 percent would see a tax hike averaging 3.7 percent of their income, or $273,400 a year. I’ll leave it to you to judge how likely Republicans are to champion such a plan. It’s common in economic analysis to assume that the long-run budget deficit a government runs is $0. That is, all budget deficits are eventually financed by budget surpluses in the future, and tax cuts that increase the deficit have to eventually be paid for by tax hikes or spending cuts in the future. But the “long run” is very long indeed. The US has historically run budget deficits much more often than it’s run surpluses, and the deficits were substantially larger than those rare surpluses as well. Over the span of US history, the country has spent considerably more than it’s taxed. And maybe that’s okay. The United States isn’t a business whose books need to balance eventually. It’s a permanent government that pays its debts in a currency it controls. If its deficits get too big, that can spur high interest rates and inflation, which have a number of negative consequences. But there have been no signs of either of those problems in recent years. That’s led a lot of people, like my colleague Matt Yglesias, to grow skeptical of the idea that deficit-financed policies like tax cuts have to be, in some meaningful sense, “paid for.” The Bush tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars haven’t really been “paid for” yet in any way. Maybe the Trump tax cuts will be the same. That’s a fair argument, but it’s not one that Republicans in Congress are making. Their claim, instead, is that they’re going to enact this massive tax cut and then pivot to cutting spending programs, in particular Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps. In that context, it makes sense to consider what such pay-fors would do to the overall distribution of the tax cuts. And what they do is make the tax cuts extremely regressive, and create net tax hikes on the middle class and poor.

        "articles": "Outside contributors' opinions and analysis of the most important issues in politics, science, and culture. On Wednesday, November 9, after the presidential victory by Donald Trump and the Republican’s sweep of both houses of Congress, Paul Ryan said that “to heal the divisions of a long campaign … [t]his needs to be a time of redemption.” Historically literate Americans felt it a curious choice of words. Redemption was the term used by white-supremacist Democrats in the 1870s to refer to the reversal of Reconstruction, a process that was perhaps the most violent and anti-democratic campaign in American history. It stands as a frightening comparison for Americans committed to more inclusive, equalitarian democracy because Trump and his administration have the real opportunity to reshape the nation’s political structures to perpetuate racial, religious, sexual, and economic oppression in virtually unprecedented ways. After the Civil War, Southern states were quickly returned to the Union with many of the same leaders who had participated in the Confederacy. President Andrew Johnson, inaugurated after Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865, began conciliating former Confederates and alienating Republicans — the party of anti-slavery and Union. Tensions between Johnson and Congress, and between the Southern states and the federal government, escalated to the point that congressional Republicans impeached Johnson and passed the Military Reconstruction Acts in March 1867. These acts enabled the enfranchisement of black men in the South, led to the drafting of newly democratized Southern state constitutions, and helped secure the ratification of the Reconstruction amendments. The 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship for all Americans and guaranteed equal protection and due process; then the 15th Amendment prohibited racial restrictions when voting. 1868 was the high-water mark of Reconstruction. Biracial coalitions of black and white Republicans swept to power across the South. They funded public education, turned local appointed offices into elected ones — dismantling a patronage system — granted women independent property rights, built railroads, bridges, and poorhouses, and even, in some places, decriminalized interracial marriage. African Americans reunited with families torn apart by slavery, negotiated for more favorable labor contracts, and established churches, political organizations, and militias. There was a significant limit, however, to Reconstruction’s impact upon the lives of millions of people struggling in the war’s aftermath, black and white alike, radical though that impact was. There was no real redistribution of land to former slaves, and both state and federal governments proved incapable of effectively addressing widespread hunger and health crises. Women were not granted the rights to vote and hold office. Still, unlike any time before in American history, federal and state governments were led by, and responsive to, both black and white men from across the economic spectrum. Conservative white Southerners organized in response both formally through the Democratic Party — at the time an explicitly racist party whose economic policies rewarded the rich while mobilizing a rhetoric about the importance of the common farmer—and through an unprecedented campaign of racist vigilante violence. Vigilantes assassinated, whipped, or threatened thousands of Republicans; most of their victims were black, though many were white. Many vigilantes were part of the newly created Ku Klux Klan, a loose network rather than a single organization of racial terror, though hundreds of black and white Republicans were also killed by impromptu mobs. Republican voters were intimidated, ballots were destroyed, and dozens of Republican politicians were assassinated. One by one, state governments were “redeemed” by explicitly white supremacist Democrats who declared that they were restoring “a white man’s government.” Once Democrats retook a state government, they ensured that Republicans would not get control again. They quickly called constitutional conventions that reversed the democratizing changes of 1868. By 1876, only three Southern states still had Republican control. The 1876 presidential campaign was marked by more fraud and violence, committed not by disguised Klansmen but openly defiant rifle clubs and groups that called themselves Red Shirts. The Democratic nominee Samuel Tilden won the popular vote — though that may have been the result of violence and intimidation. But a disputed electoral vote led to a bargain wherein Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican nominee, would get the presidency, and the last remaining federal troops — too few in number to prevent the violence, in any case — were removed from the South. “Redemption” thus ended Reconstruction. There is a common misconception that 1877 marked the end of black political life in the South, but the end of Reconstruction did not lead immediately to segregation. Though Democrats controlled Southern legislatures, 1876 to 1900 was a quarter-century period when some black men could still vote in the South — depending upon state laws and local levels of intimidation — and viable biracial political coalitions occasionally arose to challenge Democratic hegemony. As C. Vann Woodward most famously proved, Jim Crow segregation was not secured until the late 1890s and early 1900s. Racial oppression in Jim Crow was achieved through legal, political, and extralegal mechanism. These included the constant threat of mob violence in the form of lynching; the Plessy vs. Ferguson Supreme Court decision that twisted the purpose of the 14th Amendment and legalized intentionally discriminatory laws in housing, public accommodations, education; and voter disfranchisement in the form of literacy tests and poll taxes. These efforts led to the so-called “Solid South” wherein the Republican Party essentially ceased to exist. They were also aided by the national Republican Party’s retreat from both black civil rights and the economic concerns of everyday farmers. When faced with the threat of a political insurgency from the original Populists — who sought to make the nation’s economy more equitable by expanding the money supply and establishing policies friendly to common farmers — Republicans ceded no ground, affirming the banking and industrial interests in the Northeast and embracing imperialism abroad. White Republicans acquiesced to Democrats’ usurpation of power in the South in order to continue to compete as a national party. Jim Crow was finally dismantled by the achievements of the civil rights movement, which were so vast that the period has sometimes been called a Second Reconstruction. In particular, the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act re-opened Southern, and by extension, American, politics to both white and black voters. The Democratic Party in the North had been cautiously embracing civil rights for African Americans since at least the 1930s, leading many white Southerners to switch to the Republican Party, precipitating the dismantling of the Solid South. The Second Reconstruction also proved broader than the first. Social Security was expanded to all Americans, and the creation of Medicare and the War on Poverty led to a more effective welfare state. Public schools were desegregated. Women gained radical new opportunities to participate in the workplace, sports, and education. Our understandings of human sexuality were radically expanded through the gay rights movement. For another quarter century, American politics saw a system where both political parties were competitive in almost every state. As in the case of the original Reconstruction, the accomplishments of the Second Reconstruction were also slowly chipped away. This occurred less through legislative prohibitions on political participation than a slow disintegration of our national commitment to civil rights and integration. School desegregation was protested and abandoned; the so-called “war on crime” led to the imprisonment and disfranchisement of millions of African-American men; and deregulation of the national economy resulted in both soaring inequality and soaring corporate profits. But there were marked differences between the efforts to reverse the first and second Reconstructions. Conservative campaigns in the 19th century had harnessed vigilante violence as well as local, federal, and state governments to erect explicit discriminatory policies and sustained patterns of economic oppression against African Americans. By contrast, American conservatism in the second half of the 20th century and into the first parts of the 21st — the ideologies of Nixon, Reagan, and Bush — let unfettered corporate capitalism function as the chief agent of inequality. This was couched in the language and genuine ideology of small government; “Government is the problem,” Ronald Reagan declared in his 1981 inaugural address. This ideology of conservatism arguably did more harm through inaction and deregulation than through explicitly discriminatory federal policies. Late 20th-century conservatives increased budget deficits, defanged government regulators, and used the mechanisms of mass incarceration to plunder the poor and stifle mobility, but they rhetorically resisted outright discrimination on the basis of race — particularly in George W. Bush’s “compassionate conservatism” in the early 2000s. Conservatives tried to demolish protections against discrimination like affirmative action, but with the notable exceptions of mass incarceration and bans on gay marriage, the state itself was not really the chief agent of oppression against American minorities. Until the Tea Party. The trends that led to Obama’s presidency have sometimes been called a Third Reconstruction. The label was applied not only because the nation elected its first black president, but because the Obama coalition was a broad and diverse group committed to inclusive and rational political solutions to America’s problems. Today, the efforts to reverse what this third Reconstruction accomplished seem more like the redemption of the 19th century than conservative responses to the New Deal and the civil rights movement — and not just in the superficial way Trump supporters’ red hats echo the Red Shirts. Unlike the conservatism espoused by Reagan and Bush, the Tea Party and now the Trump administration propose adding the teeth of explicit racial and sexual discrimination to the small-government model of corporate plunder. Trump campaigned on promises to create a federal registry of American Muslims, discriminate against transgender people, stop almost all immigration, increase deportation of undocumented people, criminalize women’s reproductive choices, punish dissidents and political opponents, and restrict access to the ballot. There is much less deadly political violence now than the 19th-century redeemers committed, but Trump put violence and vigilantism at the center of his presidential campaign. He was endorsed by resurgent white supremacist groups including the Ku Klux Klan and has only given pro forma denunciations of them. Many of his supporters took it upon themselves to threaten or commit political violence. Everyday conservatives had begun bringing guns to protest health care reform town halls in 2009, and the open display of arms, including assault rifles, became a common feature at conservative rallies. Trump subtly and not so subtly encouraged his crowds to beat up protesters. He capitalized on the murder of 50 LGBTQ people in Orlando to justify his calls for banning Muslim immigration. He suggested that if Hillary Clinton won, “Second Amendment people” might assassinate her. He used rhetorical violence against our electoral system by declaring that he would only accept the outcome of the election if he won. Racist and sexist violence erupted in the aftermath of his victory. The Southern Poverty Law Center has tracked over 700 pro-Trump hate crimes in the immediate aftermath of the election, with the most common being attacks against immigrants — and most commonly occurring in K-12 schools. Just as redeemers focused on solidifying control on a state-by-state basis, Tea Party Republicans have also concentrated on taking over state house legislatures. They have succeeded to the point that although the majority of Americans identify as Democrats, after the 2016 election Republicans control both houses of state legislatures in at least 32 of the 50 states. Republicans would only need to take over six more states to be able to ratify any constitutional amendment of their choice. Those legislatures have redrawn both state and congressional districts to radically depress representation by Democrats. This has happened nationally, but most egregiously in the South. According to a report by the Institute for Southern Studies, in 2012 41 percent of Southerners voted for Democrats to represent them in Congress, but only 29 percent of the elected representatives from the South were Democrats. As a result, it is nearly impossible for Democrats to take control of either a majority of state legislatures or the US House of Representatives. Trump and Tea Party Republicans are also engaging in a widespread attack on the very methods by which our representative democracy functions. They have refused to approve qualified judicial nominations by President Obama. They disdain constitutional protections for religious freedom and equal protection. The most awful, but under-reported, of their efforts is voter suppression. Republican-controlled legislatures have passed voter ID laws that we should recognize violate the letter and spirit of the 14th and 15th Amendments. State and county electoral boards have limited voting sites, cut voting hours, and purged voters from their rolls — often improperly and always with undue impact on racial minorities. Though these efforts are not considered to be a decisive reason for Trump’s Electoral College victory, it is impossible to know how many thousands of Democratic voters were dissuaded from voting in Republican-controlled battleground states like Florida, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. Political, social, and technological trends are driving Americans toward more entrenched residential and social segregation. Supposedly color-blind education policies encouraged school resegregation during the 1990s and 2000s. The echo chambers of social media — including Facebook, which recently admitted its algorithm has no mechanism to control for the spread of verifiably fake news reports — means that tech corporations are profiting off of Americans’ inability to talk to each other across political divides. Trump’s efforts to incite Americans against each other was aided by preexisting trends from the dismantling of the second Reconstruction that prevented suburban and rural white people from encountering nonwhite folks in equitable day-to-day interactions. Most of Trump’s electoral gains over Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign occurred in places that are overwhelmingly white. Though markedly different in both intention and the scale of violence, Trump’s campaign and the wider Tea Party that fueled it echoed the redeemers’ campaigns of vigilantism and intimidation, state-by-state legislative triumphs, neighborhood and educational segregation, and the perversion of American democracy through the political suppression of poor and nonwhite people. What, then, can Reconstruction and redemption teach Americans eager to restore an inclusive democracy to political power? Historians are not good prognosticators of the future, nor are we trained in political coalition building. Our commitments to an accurate understanding of the past and the importance of teaching all our students also means it is both difficult and unwise for us to make many suggestions for the present without both skewing our understanding of the past and alienating people who politically disagree with us. I offer the following not as a historical prescription, nor as campaign strategy, nor because of my affinity for a particular political party, but out of my desire to see an effective response to the political trends that trouble me because of their historical echoes. One lesson is the importance of rejecting paranoia but listening to testimonies of terror. Paranoia gripped many Americans throughout Reconstruction. People feared that Andrew Johnson would set himself up as a king; that Ulysses S. Grant would orchestrate a military coup; that foreign powers would invade the United States. Almost none of these wild fears had any basis in fact. But everyday white Americans, especially in the North, chose to turn a blind eye to the real violence that was happening to African Americans. Many white people actively denied that the Ku Klux Klan was even a real thing. Northern newspapers were as likely to joke about Ku Klux Klan members as to critique the violence they were committing. When Major Lewis Merrill of the US Seventh Cavalry arrived in South Carolina in 1871 on orders to investigate and stop the racist violence, he came with the belief that “the stories in circulation [about violence] were enormous exaggerations, and that the newspaper stories were incredible.” He found the opposite to be true. “I am now of the opinion,” he testified to a congressional committee, “that I never conceived of such a state of social disorganization being possible in any civilized community as exists in this country now.” Merrill’s investigation resulted in the arrests of hundreds of Klansmen and the effective dissolution of the Klan by late 1871, but it did not prevent the eventual reversal of Reconstruction. Today we should be wary that our worst fears are as likely to be stoked by the echo chamber of social media as they are to be real. But we should absolutely listen with open ears and anxious hearts to the stories of violence committed against people of color, immigrants, and LGBTQ people by Americans who supported Donald Trump. These stories are especially worrisome because the federal government will now be led by the very man who incited this violence. During Reconstruction, the federal government used congressional investigations, the fledgling Department of Justice, and even the US Army in attempts to secure voting rights for black men. During the New Deal and the civil rights movement, too, federal courts and the federal government proved essential allies for labor and civil rights. But the federal government might no longer function as a check to discrimination by individual states during the Trump administration. It is difficult to predict the extent to which the Trump administration will follow through on its campaign promises to register and track American Muslims, ban immigration from the Middle East, increase the deportation programs of the Obama administration, limit access to reproductive health for women, and jail political opponents. Trump’s declaration that he would not pursue charges against Hillary Clinton conveniently ignored the practice that the president does not directly control the investigations of the Department of Justice. Trump and his surrogates have given conflicting statements about the creation of a registry for Muslim Americans. But if implemented, any one of these efforts would fundamentally reshape the relationship between the federal government and American citizens. Another chief lesson of Reconstruction is the importance that Democrats ought to place upon regaining representation in state legislatures. During Reconstruction, national Republicans failed to safeguard the control of state legislatures they briefly achieved. Our system of federalism still delegates considerable power to state legislatures ranging from education to health care to the electoral franchise. State legislatures controlled by Republicans today ensure their continued dominance through redistricting and voting rules just as Democrats did during redemption. Democrats should focus on regaining power at the state level both to safeguard their future as a national party and to ensure that they can implement policies that will positively help Americans at the local level. Though Reconstruction was reversed, the constitutional amendments that radically expanded the rights of American citizens remained in the letter of the law; they continued to inspire, and they served as a latent source of political power. In hindsight it seems that the Obama administration achieved few accomplishments that cannot be undone by a Republican Congress and a Trump presidency. The Affordable Care Act seems likely to be dismantled, as does much of the social safety net, including hallmarks of the Second Reconstruction like Medicare and the expansion of Social Security. The Supreme Court’s ruling for marriage equality should stand as a substantial step forward for LGBTQ people, but the Obama administration achieved no substantial expansion of employment or housing protections for ordinary LGBTQ folks (aside from federal employees and the military). Many states have already passed bills that erode existing discrimination protections on the grounds of so-called “religious liberty” or that explicitly discriminate against transgender people. Most significantly, the Obama administration did little to curtail the power of the executive branch. Indeed, the administration expanded executive privilege because of congressional intransigence and gave to it increased surveillance and police powers. Cyber-spying, data-mining, and assassinations by drone-strikes against American citizens are now at Trump’s fingertips. There were no new constitutional protections for women’s reproductive rights or gender discrimination, and no constitutional or substantive legislative efforts to protect the right to vote, despite Obama’s declaration that “we have to fix” long voting lines in his 2012 victory speech. Reconstruction teaches us the critical importance of open access to the ballot. Expanding voting rights will be a difficult task, and not only because of the lack of power the Democratic Party has in most states. Unfortunately, many Americans support voter ID laws, even though there is astoundingly little in-person electoral fraud. Even more frustratingly, our national television media gave insufficient coverage of voter suppression during this election. Virtually no election night coverage mentioned that Wisconsin — which Trump won by fewer than 28,000 votes — had passed a voter ID law requiring identification that 300,000 voters in Wisconsin did not have. Most Americans take for granted that citizens convicted of felonies lose their right to vote, but the intersections of these prohibitions with mass incarceration have radically reshaped the voting population of states like Florida. Though the current mechanisms of voter suppression are more difficult to notice or discuss than the clear fraud and intimidation of Reconstruction, Democrats must assert that there is a positive right to vote that many Republicans are intentionally denying to American citizens. Like the redeemers, Trump’s campaign was a direct assault upon the ideals of a diverse, functional representative democracy that values the political and economic inclusion of all of its citizens. It strikes me that those of us who want a nation made up of Americans who think, look, pray, work, and love differently need to assert clearly that we want such diversity to be at the heart of the opposition to Trump’s presidency. American leftists are currently debating the ways post-election post-mortems should prioritize singular economic, gender, or racial factors that led to Trump’s victory, with some advocating that identity politics be entirely abandoned. That feels misguided precisely because the oppression Trump and his supporters seek cuts across multiple identities; they seek an intersectional oppression. Trump and his supporters intertwined narratives of racial, sexual, and economic grievances they claimed had been done by people who were not true Americans, women who advocated for equal pay for equal work, undocumented workers, free-trade politicians (if they were Democrats), Black Lives Matters protestors, Muslim refugees. White moderates and liberals must not abandon the project of protecting minority rights. During Reconstruction, an increasingly polarized white electorate rejected black political activism rather than racist violence. Republicans in the 19th century preserved their party but lost the heart of American democracy by giving up on minority rights and a fledgling commitment to economic equality. Reconstruction failed because it was under direct assault in the South, but moderate white folks in the North could have committed to defending it for far longer than they did. This history ought to inform conversations among Democrats about the need to work with the Trump administration to appeal to the white working class. Democrats will likely find both electoral defeat and great moral failure if appeals to white voters jeopardize the inclusion and political rights of racial and sexual minorities. Perhaps Americans opposed to Trump and the Tea Party can regain political power by explicitly intertwining economic and identity concerns with a positive fight for the institutions of American democracy at local, state, and federal levels. After all, Trump won by stoking the basest fears of a minority of Americans in opposition to a political system he called rigged. Though his message was effective in the Electoral College, it did not capture the votes of the majority of American voters. Over 2 million more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump. In response, Americans opposed to Trump’s political vision might embrace a commitment to fostering diverse, inclusive communities at all levels in ways that can channel rather than silence intra-party disagreement. Some scholars of the civil rights movement have described the disagreements that arose among differing goals, tactics, and organizations of the second Reconstruction as a productive tension. A similar ethos today might be useful in the face of the existential threat of a federal government controlled by people eager to use the power of the state to dismantle multicultural democracy. Whether such an abstract approach would prove electorally successful is of course unknowable; that it would articulate a coherent opposition to Trump’s politics feels certain. Democrats ought to resist the temptation to seek out race- and gender-blind appeals to centrist white voters or to trot out new focus-group-tested and major-donor-approved slogans. The Democrats cannot claim inclusivity without incorporating it into our political economy. Unlike the Republicans facing the reversal of Reconstruction, people today opposed to Trump’s vision of America might choose to actively embrace a broad mobilization that champions the ways that different kinds of Americans in different kinds of communities can be together committed to the idea that all Americans’ voices count. Let us seek to make our nation more politically, economically, and socially equitable. Redemption — the campaign to reverse Reconstruction — stands as a stark lesson about the long-term damage that can come to our democracy from insufficiently inclusive political action.

The Senate has officially confirmed former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler for the role of EPA administrator, a position he had taken over in an acting capacity following Scott Pruitt’s resignation last July. Wheeler, who was confirmed for the EPA deputy administrator role in April 2018, appears to be cut from much of the same cloth as his former boss when it comes to rolling back environmental regulations. Here are three key facts to know about the person who will continue overseeing the Environmental Protection Agency. Wheeler is a former lobbyist who represented Murray Energy, a massive mining company, as one of his chief clients. Murray Energy was among the companies Wheeler listed on his financial disclosures while he was being considered for the deputy administrator position. Others included Xcel Energy and General Mills. Murray Energy CEO Robert Murray is also a well-known Trump adviser and supporter, who Wheeler worked with closely. As a New York Times story lays out, Murray was the architect of a so-called environmental regulations wish list, which detailed a list of policies aimed at reinvigorating the coal industry such as curbing restrictions on greenhouse gases and slashing staff at the EPA. Wheeler and Murray were photographed at a March 2017 meeting with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, where many of these policies were purportedly discussed. All this suggests that Wheeler won’t be particularly aggressive toward the coal industry while in office. “Andrew Wheeler’s coal credentials are without equal,” Sen. Edward Markey has said, according to CBS News. “He is, without question, a member of the coal industry’s Hall of Fame.” Wheeler was also a longtime staffer for Sen. Jim Inhofe, serving as chief counsel for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee while the lawmaker was chair, according to Inside Climate News. All told, Wheeler spent 14 years working with Inhofe on the Hill. Inhofe was among Pruitt’s biggest fans, although the barrage of scandals ultimately began to dim his enthusiasm. Inhofe is known for denying that climate change is affected by human activity, once throwing a snowball onto the Senate floor to counter arguments about climate change and prove that it was “very, very cold” outside. (His former staffers have become nicknamed by some as the “Inhofe mafia.”) During a congressional hearing earlier this year, Wheeler discussed the threat of climate change, and acknowledged that humans play a role. He stopped short, however, from deeming climate change the “greatest crisis” the world currently faces. “I would not call it the greatest crisis, no sir. I would call it a huge issue that has to be addressed globally,” he said, noting that his concerns come out at an “8 or 9” on a 1 to 10 scale. As the New York Times points out, however, there is one crucial way that Wheeler differs from his departing boss. Pruitt was Oklahoma’s attorney general before being named to Trump’s Cabinet, and an outsider who recklessly took advantage of the privileges he obtained. Wheeler is seen as a seasoned political operative who knows how to carefully traverse the system. (He was also at the EPA as a special assistant in the agency’s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics for four years before he worked for Inhofe.) Unlike Mr. Pruitt — who had come to Washington as an outsider and aspiring politician, only to get caught up in a swirl of controversy over his costly first-class travel and security spending — Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a consummate Washington insider who avoids the limelight and has spent years effectively navigating the rules. Pruitt’s goals as EPA administrator have centered on crafting (or destroying) policy in order to establish a friendlier regime for the fossil fuel industry. His efforts have included revising emissions standards for cars and trucks, increasing his control over the implementation of the Clean Water Act and weakening standards on hazardous chemicals. It appears that Wheeler is on track to do more of the same — and his insider instincts and methodical nature could mean even more effective rollbacks. (A number of Pruitt policies are thought to be shoddily constructed and have faced significant legal challenges.) As Trump said himself, “I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda.” We have a request In moments like this — as people grapple to understand variants and vaccines, and kids head back to school — many outlets take their paywalls down. ’s content is always free, in part because of financial support from our readers.
