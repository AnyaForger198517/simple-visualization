        "articles": "Still giddy about their political victory in the special congressional election in upstate New York, Democrats have resolved to put the GOP plan to phase out Medicare at the heart of their 2012 election strategy. But they may have more to thank Rep. Paul Ryan for. Though the Medicare provision in Ryan’s budget, which has been embraced by House and Senate Republicans, has dominated headlines, his plan to roll back Medicaid dramatically is another essential element of the GOP budget, and a new poll has found that Americans are loath to support this effort to gut Medicaid. As NPR’s Julie Rovner explains: This month’s health tracking poll from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation finds that only 13 percent of those polled support major reductions in Medicaid spending as part of congressional efforts to reduce the deficit. At the same time, 60 percent want to keep Medicaid as it is… Perhaps even more striking, although maybe it shouldn’t be given how much Medicaid has grown in recent years, is that more than half of respondents said they had a personal connection to the Medicaid program. That was defined as the respondent or a friend or family member having received assistance from the program at some point. Medicaid has often been characterized as a program for the very poor, yet the economic downturn has put a record number of Americans into the program. What’s more, senior citizens also receive a big proportion of Medicaid dollars through nursing homes, as even middle-class Americans have resorted to the program as their savings have run out. Medicaid is serving a larger and more diverse group of Americans than before, making the GOP proposal to eviscerate the program all the more unpopular—and politically dangerous for the Republicans. But the Dems may not be positioned to unleash a full-fledged offensive against the Rs on Medicaid. While Democratic opposition to the Ryan plan for Medicare has been nearly unanimous, there’s more of a split within the party concerning Medicaid, which state governments have to pay for as well. Squeezed by state budget crises, some Democratic officials have joined Republicans in pushing the Obama administration to give states greater leeway to reduce benefits and cut down the Medicaid rolls. Though most Dems oppose the Ryan plan for Medicaid—which would radically reduce the amount of money in the program—they’re more inclined to support some reductions to the program. Consequently, Democratic-supported cutbacks to Medicaid are still possible, and this could undermine the Democrats’ ability to use the draconian GOP Medicaid rollback against the Republicans. Still, when Gene Sperling, the director of the White House national economic council, appeared at a conference on fiscal issues this week in Washington, he made it a point to note that the Republican budget’s Medicaid “reform” was perhaps even more severe than its Medicare provision. He emphasized the fact that much of Medicaid covers nursing home patients. It was perhaps the clearest sign yet that the White House sees an opening.

        "articles": "Les Stone/Zuma Two weeks ago, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued a new set of stringent guidelines for abortion clinics. Under the new requirements, the three remaining clinics in the state would have to make enormous structural changes to their buildings and obtain new certifications in just two weeks or face possible closure. These types of laws are known as Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP) laws, and critics say they’re intended to make it almost impossible for clinics to operate. But despite the new rules, abortion rights activists aren’t giving up: On Tuesday, the Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR) filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of one of the remaining Kansas clinics, the Center for Women’s Health, which is run by a father/daughter duo who practice in Overland Park. In a complaint filed in federal court in Kansas City, physicians at the Center for Women’s Health claim they weren’t given the final instructions about the new regulations until June 17, and that they were ordered to adhere to the guidelines—which included things like number, type, and dimension of rooms—by July 1. They were then denied a temporary license based on an existing law that would allow them to request waivers. Dr. Hodes and Dr. Nauser, the team operating the clinic, “cannot meet these requirements without rebuilding their office from the ground up,” according to a press release. The guidelines are so harsh that they sometimes verge on parody; one requires that abortion offices come equipped with pediatric-sized ventilation masks, cannulas, and other instruments even though the clinic’s doctors do “not have child-aged patients, do not deliver babies in their office, and only perform abortions there prior to fetal viability.” The CRR suit argues that many of the requirements are “ambiguous and unclear.” But even though the guidelines would force some clinics to rebuild, the Kansas Department of Health issued a statement claiming that the new guidelines “should not impose any unusual cost on regulated providers or consumers of provider services.” In its suit, the Center for Reproductive Rights argues that the new rules come at the expense of due process, among other things. As for Kansans, if the health department gets its way, the cost to them may be living in a state that does not have a single clinic where abortions can be performed safely and legally.

        "articles": "Screenshot: Fox Business After first placing Paul Ryan’s drastic Medicaid-slashing proposal on the negotiating table, Republicans are lining up behind a yet another plan to curb the program’s benefits and payments—a smaller-scale change that’s likelier to pass Congress. Republicans in both houses introduced bills on Tuesday that would eliminate federal regulations that prevent states from trimming their Medicaid rolls or erecting new barriers to enrollment. In February, Mother Jones broke the news that Republicans planned to target these so-called Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirements, which the federal government put in place after giving states a new injection of Medicaid money in 2009. Now they’ve made good on their promise. The State Flexibility Act—sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) in the Senate and Reps. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (D-Wash.) in the House—would give states significantly more leeway in kicking beneficiaries to the curb, reducing payment to nursing homes, and making other reductions to shrink budget gaps. “Take the handcuffs off the governors,” Gingrey (R-Ga.) said at the bill’s unveiling on Tuesday, arguing that current law prevents the states from “ferreting out waste, fraud, and abuse, finding out if someone’s falsified information on income…maybe even if they’re illegal immigrants.” The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bill would save $2.8 billion over five years. The State Flexibility Act would not go as far as the Ryan plan, which proposes a massive overhaul of the Medicaid funding structure. But it would allow states to take a knife, if not a hatchet, to the program. Gingrey said that only 300,000 beneficiaries would be eliminated from the program under the bill, but he and his colleagues admitted that they didn’t have an independent CBO estimate to confirm the number. Back in 2001, before the federal government made Medicaid money contingent on the MOE rules, states took 1.2 to 1.6 million people off Medicaid. Having already made steep cuts to provider payments and benefits, “some states will certainly make eligibility cuts,” says Edwin Park, VP for health policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Moreover, by introducing new procedural hurdles—Mississippi, for instance, has made it harder for people to renew coverage—states could deter more-vulnerable residents from signing up, says Park. Similar proposals put forward in California would have reduced enrollment by 500,000, he adds. That said, the act has a better chance of making it through Congress than Ryan’s controversial budget, at least, which passed the GOP-controlled House on a strict party-line vote. “Eliminating the MOE provision is so much easier to get done, it’s easy to understand—you have such strong bipartisan support on this one,” Gingrey told me. “You don’t quite have that bipartisan level of support” with Ryan’s plan to administer Medicaid as block grants to the states. While Gingrey wouldn’t “name names” of any Democrats on board, a handful of Democratic governors facing budget crises might support such legislation. In Washington, for instance, Rep. McMorris Rodgers has heard encouraging words from Democratic Gov. Christine Gregoire, who’s pushed for more state more control over Medicaid. By pushing the Ryan plan so aggressively, the GOP has managed to move back the goalposts of the Medicaid debate: This plan, by comparison, appears significantly more moderate. What’s more, Republicans seem to be anticipating the common criticism that their cutbacks victimize the most vulnerable. At the Tuesday press conference, Hatch pointed out that ballooning Medicaid costs might force states to further cut things like education and law enforcement. His colleagues similarly claimed that paring back Medicaid would free up money for public university tuition, transportation, and environmental protection. In fact, the Republicans have pushed for major cuts to all of those programs, so it may be tough to convince the public that they’re eager to spend elsewhere. And all the talk about giving states “flexibility” is, of course, a euphemism for snipping away at the social safety net.

        "articles": "A sign reading \"Help! Solve the Water Crisis,\" posted in California's central valley. In Pictures Ltd./Getty This story was originally published by The Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. California water officials have moved to stop Nestlé from siphoning millions of gallons of water out of California’s San Bernardino forest, which it bottles and sells as Arrowhead brand water, as drought conditions worsen across the state. The draft cease-and-desist order, which still requires approval from the California Water Resources Control Board, is the latest development in a protracted battle between the bottled water company and local environmentalists, who for years have accused Nestlé of draining water supplies at the expense of local communities and ecosystems. Nestlé has maintained that its rights to California spring water dates back to 1865. But a 2017 investigation found that Nestlé was taking far more than its share. Last year the company drew out about 58 million gallons, far surpassing the 2.3 million gallons per year it could validly claim. Nestlé has sucked up, on average, 25 times as much water as it may have a right to, according to the Story of Stuff Project, an environmental group that has been fighting to stop the bottled water company’s pumping in California for years. State officials sent the company a letter notifying it of the order on Friday. “We have a limited amount of water, said Julé Rizzardo, the assistant deputy director of the Division of Water Rights. “And as we face our second dry year in a row, it’s important that we use our authority to protect the municipal water supply and the environment.” Strawberry Creek, which Nestlé has been pumping from, is a tributary of the Santa Ana river, which provides drinking water for about about 750,000 residents. The region’s watersheds also provide a habitat for deer, fox and mountain lions, and threatened Alameda whipsnakes. The draft order comes two months after Nestlé, which is based in Switzerland, sold its US- and Canada-based water brands to equity firms One Rock Capital Partners and Metropoulos for $4.3 billion. Nestlé Waters North America, which has been rebranded as BlueTriton Brands, has 20 days to appeal the draft order and ask for a hearing. A spokesperson said the assessment that it only had the right to draw 7.26 acre-feet of water per year was erroneous. The company’s water fight in California mirrors similar fights in Oregon, Pennsylvania, Maine and Michigan. Across the US, conservationists have accused Nestlé of leveraging vast lobbying funds to bend local and federal officials to its will. “The forests that Nestlé is draining—they’re our forests, supported by every US taxpayer,” said Amanda Frye, an activist who provided state officials with documents and research going back at least a century to show Nestlé did not have the right to the water it was pumping. Frye, who has been protesting Nestlé’s pumping from Strawberry Creek for years, said the draft order is significant. “But we still have a long way to go in protecting the forest from over-pumping,” she said. The pumping has desiccated Strawberry Creek, damaging a local ecosystem. “It’s such a lovely ecosystem, and it’s doubly under threat due to climate change,” Frye said. “I hope that if Nestlé stops pumping, the environment will be able to heal.” Officials said the state’s water board cannot easily challenge Nestlé’s rights to creek water established before 1914. If the board approves the cease-and-desist order against BlueTriton, the company could face fines of up to $1,000 a day, or up to $10,000 a day if a drought is declared in the area. Meanwhile, as much of the western US faces extreme drought conditions, long-standing fights in California between farmers, cities and environmental groups over the state’s scarce water supplies have heated up. Governor Gavin Newsom has already declared a regional drought emergency in two counties, after a dry winter left the state’s major reservoirs at half capacity or lower. The climate crisis has brought on hotter, drier conditions – leaving the state more vulnerable water shortages and wildfires. Prior to its sale this year, Nestlé Waters North America was the largest bottled water company in the US—its brands include Poland Spring and Zephyrhills. It paid the Forest Service a permit fee of $2,100 per year, but had been pumping water for free. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "<a  Point Fr<a/>/Shutterstock The abortion rate is declining, but that has nothing to do with the sharp increase in anti-abortion legislation over the past decade. Instead, you can give credit to effective contraception, according to a new study. From 2008 to 2011, the abortion rate dropped 13 percent, but it did so at a similar pace as the overall decline in the national birth rate, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank that regularly releases data on sexual and reproductive health. A new study by Guttmacher, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, states that unplanned pregnancies are occurring less frequently, but the percentage of unplanned pregnancies that end in abortion remains statistically the same. In 2008, for example, 40 percent of unplanned pregnancies ended in abortion, and in 2011, 42 percent did. But, the overall rate of unintended pregnancies dropped 18 percent between 2008 and 2011—its lowest in 30 years, according to Guttmacher. The study’s authors point out that the use of long-acting reversible contraception (or LARCs) such as IUDs or implants more than tripled between 2007 and 2012. Considered by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists as the most reliable and effective form of birth control, the use of LARCs contributed to the declining unintended pregnancy rate. But poor women and women of color are still disproportionately affected; while rates are falling everywhere, they are falling less for these women, most likely because LARCs are more difficult to obtain in these communities. A different study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that rates of unintended pregnancy for poor women were two to three times the national average. IUDs are very effective, but they can be costly—according to Planned Parenthood’s website, it’s possible to pay up to $1,000 for one that lasts 12 years. A New England Journal of Medicine study last month found that when Texas eliminated Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid public family planning program for low-income women, fewer claims were filed for contraception, and more low-income women in Texas ultimately gave birth. A number of restrictions on abortion in Texas have already shut down more than half of the state’s 42 clinics and could close 8 more. “Supporting and expanding women’s access to family planning services not only protects their health and rights; it also reduces abortion rates,” says Joerg Dreweke, senior policy communications associate at Guttmacher. “The clear implication for policymakers who wish to see fewer abortions occur is to focus on making contraceptive care more available by increasing funding and stopping attacks on all family planning providers.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) Center for American Progress Action Fund/FlickrIt’s breakfast time at the Larson Acres Dairy in rural Evansville, Wisconsin, and the line for hot-off-the-griddle pancakes and iced chocolate milk winds around the big barn, past the kids crawling in a bed of corn kernels, the live band tuning up, and out to the silver grain silos gleaming in the morning sun. June is Dairy Month in Wisconsin, highlighted by the weekend dairy breakfasts put on by farms across the state. On this Saturday, droves of sleepy-eyed cheeseheads descend on Larson Acres to eat, drink, buy T-shirts, and see the latest in milk-pumping technology. But before the hungry masses get to the pancake tent, they have to get past Tammy Baldwin. The seven-term Democratic congresswoman representing Wisconsin’s second district is all smiles and handshakes, issuing a stream of Greetings! and Well, hello theres. Larson Acres is on Baldwin’s home turf, as evidenced by the number of people who simply call her “Tammy” and pledge to vote for her this fall in her bid to replace the retiring Democrat Herb Kohl in the US Senate. Wisconsinites joke that Dane County, which includes Madison, the state capital, is an oasis of liberalism “surrounded by reality.” Baldwin cut her teeth in politics here, and she can bank on its support in the first statewide campaign of her 27-year career. “Reality” is where she runs into trouble. If elected, Baldwin would be the first openly gay senator in the institution’s history. Yet can a gay Madison liberal win over Wisconsinites in the polarized, cash-drenched Scott Walker era? Voters outside Dane County don’t outright dislike Baldwin (though a few million dollars in super-PAC attack ads could change that). It’s just that few of them know who she is: Ask voters in northern Wisconsin about her, and you’ll get blank stares and shrugs. Thirty two percent of voters responding to a recent Marquette University Law School poll had never heard of Baldwin. “You’d think that having been a member of Congress for a long time, she’d be known outside her district,” says Charles Franklin, a political scientist who oversees Marquette’s polling. “But that’s not the case at all.” On a break from working the pancake line at Larson Acres, Baldwin previews how she’ll win over voters who don’t know her name. It’s not what you’d expect from one of Congress’ most liberal members. Gone are the impassioned calls for a single-payer health insurance system, tougher environmental regulations, and legalizing same-sex marriage. Now Baldwin wants to talk about paper. Paper manufacturers employ more than 50,000 Wisconsinites—and Baldwin is tailoring her message to those people. “I’ve proposed policies to keep China from cheating the paper industry,” she tells me. She mentions the CHEATS Act, short for the China Hurts Economic Advancement Through Subsidies, which would impose new tariffs on Chinese paper imports. The Chinese government heavily subsidizes its paper-makers, she explains, putting Wisconsin paper plants at a disadvantage; the CHEATS Act would erase that disparity. Wisconsin’s paper industry featured front and center in the Baldwin campaign’s debut TV ad. In it, Baldwin sounds almost like a dyed-in-the-wool tea partier. “In Wisconsin, we lead the entire nation in paper industry jobs,” she says. “But China, they lead the world in cheating.” The choice to launch her TV campaign with a broadside against China and an appeal to blue-collar workers took some Wisconsin politicos by surprise. Franklin says it’s a gutsy move—and the right one in trying to appeal to white working-class voters. “You’re talking about someone stepping outside the stereotypes and representing herself in a way that is right up the alley of job creation,” he says. “I don’t think you can win on just the paper issue, but she’s chosen the issue that seems to me to have the potential for much broader appeal.” Baldwin’s tough talk on China dovetails with her broader demand for tax fairness—not just in trade, but up and down the income ladder. “It’s about fairness, playing by the rules,” she tells me. “That’s how you get a vibrant middle class in Wisconsin.” Baldwin’s blue-collar appeal also serves to deflect attacks on her liberal voting record. At Larson Acres, Baldwin reminds me that she introduced the CHEATS Act with Rep. Reid Ribble, a Republican who represents Wisconsin’s 8th district—a rural region where Baldwin needs to make inroads. In March, she cosigned a bill sponsored by conservative firebrand Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) to a build a new bridge over the St. Croix River linking Minnesota and Wisconsin. And back in her state legislature days, Baldwin co-sponsored campaign finance disclosure legislation with then-State Assemblyman—now Governor and Republican hero—Scott Walker. “Hard to imagine now, isn’t it?” she quips. Baldwin has less to say about her own story. She first dipped a toe into politics as a Dane County supervisor in the mid-1980s. Her 1992 election as the first openly gay member of the Wisconsin State Assembly catapulted her into the national debate over gay rights, HIV/AIDS, and gays in the military. Six years later she replaced outgoing Republican Scott Klug in the House of Representatives, becoming the first openly gay woman to win a congressional election. A win this November would make history once again. In the past, Baldwin saw herself as clearing the way for other gay and lesbian politicians. “Sometimes I think my most significant contribution is not the legislative initiatives I introduce, but the stereotypes I shatter,” she told the Washington Times in 1993. She has also stressed that her openness about being a lesbian plays to her advantage. “I would get statements from voters such as, ‘If you can be honest about this, I believe you’d be honest about everything with me,'” she told the Toronto Star in 1995. By now, Baldwin’s sexual orientation is old news in Wisconsin, says Susan Johnson, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater. “We’re at a point as a state and a country that that’s just not as important of an issue,” Johnson says. No matter: Baldwin has plenty more to worry about. Her Republican opponent, former governor Tommy Thompson, is as much a household name as Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, and Thompson has consistently outpolled Baldwin. Another factor: President Obama’s performance. If the Obama campaign invests heavily in the state to boost the president’s standing, it could lift every other down-ballot Democrat, including Baldwin. And a few million dollars more in outside money—super-PACs and nonprofits have already spent $850,000 attacking Baldwin—could inflict major damage. “She hasn’t been in a race where fundraising has been so important,” Johnson says. “I just think with the outside money, it’s such a wildcard.” Johnson’s advice for Baldwin is simple: Take a map, circle every must-win region, and go “make herself a presence.” Close elections are won and lost at dairy breakfasts and county fairs, Brewers and Packers games, ice cream socials and Friday fish fries. No one knows that better than Baldwin. Her summer calendar has been packed with events everywhere from Wausau to Janesville to Rhinelander. Indeed, the Larson Acres’s dairy breakfast is the first of many stops on this Saturday. Baldwin walks toward the parking lot, stopping to chat with anyone who’ll give her the time of day. “Do you have any Packers schedules?” a round-bellied, middle-aged man asks her. Baldwin glances toward a campaign aide. The aide shakes his head. “No, I’m sorry we don’t.” “You always have Packers schedules at Dairy Breakfasts,” comes the reply. The man hustles off toward the pancake tent. “Note to self,” Baldwin says to her team. “Bring Packers schedules.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Brian Snyder/Zuma Joe Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, walked onto the stage at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, a few hours before Donald Trump was supposed to deliver his acceptance speech. Arpaio, a tough-on-illegal-immigration crusader, flashed a peace sign as the crowd roared its approval. Wearing an oversize black suit and a tie pin in the shape of a pistol, the 84-year-old sheriff said he’s spent 55 years in law enforcement, but his “most important mission has just begun: to help elect Donald Trump president of the United States.” Trump is the only candidate strong enough to defend the nation from “terrorists coming over our border, infiltrating our communities and causing massive destruction and mayhem,” he said, adding that “criminals [are] penetrating our weak border security system and committing serious crime.” Arpaio earned his spot on the RNC stage by styling himself as “America’s Toughest Sheriff,” who famously stops immigrants for no reason, dresses jail inmates in pink underwear, and houses the inmates in Korean War tents in the desert heat. He’s ridden his fame to six four-year terms as sheriff of the country’s fourth-biggest county. Now running for his seventh term, he’s facing an opponent with better poll numbers whose message is getting a signal boost with $300,000 from liberal billionaire George Soros. He’s also having his own trouble with the law, with a looming criminal contempt referral for disobeying the orders of a federal judge who sought to restrain some of his anti-immigrant excesses. He’s saddled Maricopa County taxpayers with more than $140 million in settlement fees and court costs—the results of his sometimes overzealous approach to law enforcement. Arpaio has been a national figure for years, but this year’s race underscores the wider political fight playing out across the country: Donald Trump’s xenophobic brand of populist bigotry has propelled the once-taboo and semi-fringe identity politics of white racists back into the mainstream conversation. For years Arpaio has been a leading national figure for fighting and criminalizing undocumented immigrants, and this race is drawing a lot of attention. Millions of dollars in out-of-state donations have poured in for Arpaio, but his challenger—retired Phoenix Police Sergeant Paul Penzone—has also drawn outside support, chiefly in the form of an independent expenditure committee funded solely by liberal financier George Soros. Trump’s nomination could push the red state blue for the first time in a generation and motivate the state’s Hispanic voters to vote in greater numbers than ever before. A proposal to legalize recreational marijuana, and a minimum-wage ballot question could also drive younger Democratic-leaning voters to the polls. Republican Sen. John McCain’s tough challenge from Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick has enhanced on-the-ground Democratic organization across the state and won’t help Arpaio, nor will the sheriff’s ongoing “investigation” into President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. On the other hand, Trump’s intense anti-immigrant rhetoric has galvanized many voters, and Arpaio has been that crowd’s hero for years. “He’s somewhat like me,” Arpaio told the Guardian, referring to Trump. “Or I’m like him. I don’t know which way it goes.” Whichever way it is, Arpaio is still incredibly popular among Republicans in Maricopa County. He easily won the Republican primary in August, defeating three other candidates. (The second-place finisher came in nearly 40 points behind Arpaio.) So will this be Arpaio’s last election? “If it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen now,” says David Berman, a professor emeritus of political science at Arizona State University and a senior research fellow at Arizona’s Morrison Institute for Public Policy. “It’s going to be the toughest election he’s ever had.” Arpaio’s challenger is Paul Penzone, a retired Phoenix police sergeant who came within six points of beating the sheriff (50.66 to 44.65) in 2012. That year, a third-party candidate named Mike Stauffer siphoned off crucial votes. Some Arizona Democrats assumed Stauffer had been recruited by Arpaio’s campaign to thwart a Penzone victory. They wondered again this year when third-party candidate Chad Lisk threw his hat into the ring, only to be blocked after failing to garner the requisite number of petition signatures. “It’s apparent that the voters are tired of the nonsense they’ve seen from the sheriff the last several terms, and we feel confident with our chances,” said Penzone. He says the 2012 race was closer than it looked because the percentage of the vote Arpaio received was “barely above the median.” He rattles off the problems: Arpaio has cost county taxpayers at least $72 million, and that’s from only one case related to profiling and harassing Latinos; he’s facing a referral from a federal judge for criminal contempt of court related to a racial profiling case filed in 2007; his lawyers hired an investigator to look into the wife of the judge who issued that order. Penzone is announced that he filed a defamation lawsuit against Arpaio after the sheriff ran an ad recycling overstated and exaggerated claims that Penzone assaulted his ex wife in 2003. “It’s [all] just a complete abuse of his authority,” Penzone says. “The voters are tired of it, and I’m tired of it.” Chad Willems, Arpaio’s campaign manager, did not respond to several requests for comment. After the contempt referral, Willems told the Associated Press that the exorbitant legal fees were the fault of the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, because the organization refused to settle, costing taxpayers millions in legal fees. “If Penzone wants to side with the ACLU on this issue, he can be our guest,” he said. He told reporters with Cronkite News at Arizona State University that polling casting doubt on Arpaio’s popularity is dead wrong, and that the Arpaio campaign’s internal polling suggests the incumbent will “heavily” defeat Penzone. But Penzone’s political challenge isn’t Arpaio’s only problem. The sheriff could face criminal charges after US District Court Judge Murray Snow, appointed by George W. Bush, ruled August 19 that Arpaio and another senior sheriff’s deputy ignored court orders, lied to the court, and withheld information in a racial profiling case dating back to 2007. The case, Melendres v. Arpaio, was filed by a group of Latinos in Maricopa County targeted by sheriff’s deputies for illegal-immigration sweeps during traffic stops. In 2011, Snow ordered Arpaio and his deputies to quit detaining suspected undocumented immigrants who had not broken any state laws. In 2013, Snow ruled that Arpaio and his deputies had discriminated against Latinos and also that Arpaio had violated the 2011 order in part to bolster his popularity during the 2012 election. In May this year, Snow ruled that Arpaio had continued to arbitrarily detain Latinos based solely on immigration suspicions and held him in civil contempt, which left the door open for a criminal contempt referral that took place on August 19. Now the US Department of Justice will determine whether to criminally charge Arpaio with contempt of court, a crime punishable with up to six months in prison. In the middle of all this, Arpaio’s attorneys hired a private investigator to investigate the judge’s wife after a tipster told Arpaio that Snow’s wife said that Snow wanted to get Arpaio out of office. “This is really almost completely uncharted territory,” says Mel McDonald, a former US attorney who is representing Arpaio privately in the criminal case. McDonald says there isn’t a lot of precedent for Arpaio’s case, and he’s meeting with DOJ officials October 11 to figure out what the next steps will be. He says the DOJ can choose to pursue criminal charges, or it can decline to do so. Snow can then choose to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue the case. Although Arpaio is paying for his legal defense in the criminal contempt case, the rest falls on the taxpayers of Maricopa County to the tune of $72 million, according to the Arizona Republic, which notes that in all, Arpaio has cost taxpayers $142 million in legal fees, settlements and court awards since 1993. Arpaio does have a massive war chest that dwarfs the approximately $540,000 Penzone has raised thus far. According to filings published by the county on Thursday, Arpaio has raised just more than $12 million, roughly three-fourths of which came from small donors in other states, according to the Associated Press’ August analysis. Penzone also has support from out of state: Liberal financier George Soros has stepped in to help. Soros has pumped $3 million into local district attorney races in a half-dozen states over the last year with an eye toward reforming the criminal justice system, according to Politico, with millions of dollars going toward radio and television ads. In Arizona he donated $300,000, the total budget of Maricopa Strong, an independent expenditure committee not affiliated with the Penzone campaign, according to records filed with the county. “We’re looking to persuade voters who have some doubts about Arpaio because of his record of wasting taxpayer money on lawsuits and legal fees, and losing sight of his primary mission of enforcing the law and keeping the people of Maricopa County safe,” said a source close to Maricopa Strong. Despite all this baggage, Arpaio still has a strong chance of extending his 23-year reign over Maricopa County. Berman, the political scientist, says pundits have been predicting a surge of Hispanic voter turnout for years—a prospect that could cripple state Republicans up and down the ballot—only for it to never materialize. He concedes that the marijuana initiative, the minimum-wage question, an organized Democratic effort in the Kirkpatrick race against McCain, and Donald Trump—let alone all of Arpaio’s legal issues and history of racial profiling and harassment—could put Penzone over the top. But there are still many more Republican voters in Maricopa County than Democrats and independents (737,439 active Republicans, 577,885 Democrats, 743,456 others). Besides, he said, it’s Arpaio’s true believers who have kept him in office this long. “Arpaio has got the Trump supporter type—he has the same kind of true believer behind him,” says Berman. “If he went to jail, they’d still elect him. He just has this following that thinks he can do no wrong, just like Trump.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Following up on Tyler Cowen’s post about mistakes he thinks liberal and conservative economists make, David Leonhardt provides a matching pair of lists of economic blind spots among non-economists on left and right. You might agree with his lists or not, but he also has a broader point to make: I think that liberal economists, by nature, tend to be less economically liberal than your average liberal. That’s not true — or at least it’s not nearly as true — about conservative economists and conservatives generally. As a result, some of the left’s biggest blind spots on economics arise much less often among left-leaning economists. ….The difference, I think, is that conservative economists’ blind spots overlap more with general conservative blind spots than is the case for liberal economists and liberal blind spots. That’s not a value judgment so much as an observation: liberal economists tend to be more economically conservative than average liberals. Yep. Obviously there are some hardcore lefty economists out there, but for the most part liberal economists still tend to be fairly sober sorts who are wary of maximal arguments and generally in favor of market solutions in a wide variety of contexts. Conservative economists, by contrast, are largely willing — even eager — to trumpet a uniformly hardcore party line on things like regulation, taxes, unions, trade, and incentives in general. Maybe it’s because they still feel like a beleaguered minority, maybe it’s because the incentives work differently on the right. I’m not sure. But Leonhardt does seem to be right about this. As a side note, I’ll mention that I’ve seen a number of lefty bloggers engage with Tyler’s original list of lefty mistakes, but I haven’t seen anyone on the right engage with his list of righty mistakes. Maybe that’s just because I haven’t been reading the right blogs. But I have a feeling that’s not it. On the right, an awful lot of economic shibboleths have become almost religious totems, and that’s just not something you’re allowed to express any doubts about.

        "articles": "Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) has been a devoted opponent of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Bill Clark/ZUMA Ever since White House budget director Mick Mulvaney’s embattled appointment two months ago as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he’s moved swiftly to transform the watchdog agency he once called a “sick, sad” joke. He has shelved investigations and kneecapped the work of CFPB examiners by halting data collection. In just the last week, he announced plans to gut an Obama-era payday loan regulation, spend down the CFPB’s rainy day fund, and launch a review of all its operations, signaling a likely overhaul. “The structure of the CFPB is just fundamentally flawed,” Mulvaney said in a November interview shortly after taking control at the agency, adding that he planned to “try and limit as much as we can what the CFPB does to sort of interfere with capitalism and with the financial services market.” Mulvaney, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, has long sought to dilute the CFPB’s power; he once even co-sponsored a bill to eliminate it. Now that he’s in charge, he has brought in like-minded allies to help overhaul the agency. That’s meant that one of Mulvaney’s former House colleagues, Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), has seen his influence expand at the agency, as Mulvaney has hired two of his senior staffers into high-level positions. Earlier this month, Hensarling, a persistent critic of the CFPB who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, announced that Kirsten Sutton Mork, his longtime aide and committee staff director, would be leaving his office to become the CFPB’s chief of staff. In December, Hensarling staffer Brian Johnson, who also worked as the financial service’s committees chief counsel, left his job on the hill to serve as a senior adviser to Mulvaney at the CFPB. Johnson, according to the Wall Street Journal, is expected to have “authority to act on Mulvaney’s behalf” as the agency’s director straddles his two full-time jobs at the CFPB and the White House. Both Mork and Johnson are leaving Hensarling’s office as the congressman winds down his legislative career; in October, Hensarling announced he would not seek reelection in 2018. His pending retirement has fed speculation that Hensarling himself might succeed Mulvaney as the CFPB’s next Senate-confirmed director. The Trump administration has for weeks said its nomination for a new bureau head is imminent, and the congressman is said to be on the short list. So is another ex-Hensarling staffer, former counsel Mark McWatters, who now chairs the board of the National Credit Union Administration, a federal regulator. For 15 years, Hensarling has helped lead the charge in Washington against greater supervision of Wall Street, first by opposing bank regulation before the 2008 financial crisis, and later by fighting Congress’ response to that collapse: the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, which created the CFPB. The agency’s recent hires of Hensarling aides offer a glimpse into the transformation taking place at the CFPB under the influence of the Trump administration. “Hensarling has made it a mission to destroy the consumer bureau and to eviscerate the laws that protect ordinary people against Wall Street giants and predatory lenders,” says Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center. “We certainly have deep worries about anybody who shares Hensarling’s view of the importance of sabotaging the consumer watchdog.” Hensarling first arrived in Congress in 2003. By then, Democratic lawmakers had begun to grow concerned that the bloated, poorly regulated mortgage market was threatening the economy, and introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at keeping better tabs on big financial institutions and lenders. Hensarling consistently opposed these measures. “We still have to remember that millions of people have homeownership opportunities due to a subprime market. I am very leery of any legislation that could undercut that market,” Hensarling said at an October 2007 committee hearing on the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, a bill that would have increased oversight over lenders and loan processors. “We should also take note about what is happening in the marketplace now. The market has a wonderful ability to correct itself.” A year later, mortgage lending giant Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, ushering in the Great Recession. When the Bush administration proposed a $700 billion emergency bank bailout package to stave off an economic meltdown, Hensarling was among several dozen Republicans who refused to support it. At the time, Hensarling said the bailouts would put the nation “on the slippery slope to socialism.” The “no” votes of Hensarling and his colleagues sunk the bailout bill, leading to the largest one-day dive ever recorded by the Dow and the worst stock market collapse since 1987. Hensarling went on to oppose a second bailout bill, which garnered enough votes to pass. After the bailout, lawmakers began crafting what became Dodd-Frank, aiming to keep a watchful eye on the big banks and prevent crashes that might require future taxpayer-funded bailouts. Hensarling introduced proposals to defang Dodd-Frank. He sponsored a 2009 amendment which would have eliminated the Office of Financial Research, a Treasury Department bureau tasked with measuring vulnerabilities across the financial system. That same year, he sponsored a bill to roll back Dodd-Frank requirements that major financial institutions disclose information about executive incentives tied to company performance, in order to weed out arrangements that might encourage risk-taking that could put the institution—and the broader economy—in jeopardy. Hensarling took the helm of the House Financial Services Committee in 2013. Under his leadership, the committee has introduced dozens of proposals to cut or weaken Dodd-Frank’s provisions. The bills served as a basis for the Financial CHOICE Act, a broader Dodd-Frank overhaul that Hensarling has twice introduced, and which passed the House in 2017. It would roll back major regulations, like the Volcker rule aimed at curbing risky Wall Street investments and stress tests for big banks, along with protections for military veterans, the elderly, and mortgage borrowers. The bill also targets the CFPB by returning its power to enforce bank rules to the agencies that did so before the financial crisis. It would lessen the CFPB’s independence, giving the president greater power to fire its director and control its activities, and strip it of its ability to regulate “small-dollar credit,” including high-interest payday loans that often target low-income households. Over the course of his congressional career, Hensarling has accepted $8 million in campaign contributions from the real estate, insurance, and financial industries, whose activities are often regulated by the CFPB. He has also regularly been one of Congress’ top recipients of funds from commercial banks. “Mick Mulvaney and his appointees have very little interest in protecting consumers and holding financial institutions accountable for bad behavior,” says Ira Rheingold, the general counsel of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. “Now the people who supported the reckless behavior that created the financial collapse are being put back in place and trying to undo the progress that was made. It’s the ultimate example of the fox in the hen house.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Donald Trump and Andrew PuzderCarolyn Kaster/AP President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Andrew Puzder, chief executive of the company that runs fast-food giants Carl’s Jr. and Hardees, to head the Department of Labor. This choice has already sparked concern among labor advocates, given Puzder’s frequent commentaries opposing minimum-wage increases. But reproductive rights advocates should also be concerned. Puzder has long opposed abortion rights and even wrote the Missouri abortion law that the Supreme Court upheld in its 1989 Webster v. Reproductive Health Services decision. This was a seminal case that allowed states to impose far more restrictions on abortion care than had previously been permitted under Roe v. Wade, including limits on the use of public funds and facilities for abortion care. Trump has promised to appoint anti-abortion Supreme Court justices, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence has said he wants to “send Roe v. Wade to the ash heap of history.” Back in the ’80s, when he was a lawyer working in St. Louis, Puzder acted on similar convictions. In a 1984 article in the Stetson Law Journal, Puzder and another lawyer proposed that the Missouri Legislature pass a law defining life as beginning at conception in non-abortion contexts—in property or contract law, for instance. Puzder saw its purpose as mounting a challenge against Roe, which had legalized abortion a little less than a decade earlier. If the court recognized that a fetus had rights in contexts other than abortion, he reasoned, it created a foundation for challenging legal abortion down the line. “This is not an abortion statute,” Puzder told the Chicago Tribune in 1989, three months before Webster was heard by the Supreme Court. “It is designed to make the Supreme Court face the question of deciding whether a state can decide when life exists.” Puzder worked with Sam Lee, a local anti-abortion lobbyist, to move the proposal to the Legislature. The two got acquainted because Puzder had often helped get Lee out of jail following his arrests during sit-ins at abortion clinics “by arguing a defense of necessity,” noted the Tribune. “Lee had to break the law and trespass because he believed that life began at conception and that the only way to stop the greater crime was to limit access to the clinic. The defense almost always worked.” The two added a slew of other abortion restrictions to the bill—including one prohibiting the use of public resources to provide or counsel on abortions—and soon it was signed into law in Missouri. The measure was challenged by a local abortion clinic, Reproductive Health Services, and provisions of the law were subsequently found unconstitutional by several appeals courts. Ultimately, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court found that none of the bill’s provisions were unconstitutional, dealing a blow to abortion rights advocates—but the high court clarified their ruling should not be taken as a referendum on the original decision in Roe v. Wade. Now, Puzder will likely join an administration that plans to complete a mission he began 30 years ago.

        "articles": "<a  Doctr</a>/Flickr As Republican lawmakers have pushed ever more intrusive and expansive uterus-related legislation, some of their colleagues across the aisle have fired back with intentionally and equally ridiculous counterproposals. From mandatory rectal exams for guys seeking Viagra to prohibitions on sperm-stifling vasectomies, most of these male-only provisions have, unsurprisingly, flopped. But they’ve scored big as symbolic gestures, spotlighting the inherent sexism of laws that regulate only lady parts. Some of the tongue-in-cheek ideas introduced across the country: Delaware: By an 8 to 4 vote, the Wilmington, Delaware, city council recognized the personhood of semen because “each ‘egg person’ and each ‘sperm person’ should be deemed equal in the eyes of the government.” Virginia: As the state Senate debated requiring transvaginal ultrasounds for women seeking abortions, Sen. Janet Howell proposed mandating rectal exams and cardiac stress tests for men seeking erectile dysfunction meds. Her amendment failed by just two votes. Georgia: Responding to a Georgia house bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, Rep. Yasmin Neal wrote a bill outlawing most vasectomies because they leave “thousands of children…deprived of birth.“ Ohio: A bill introduced by state Sen. Nina Turner would compel men to get psychological screenings before getting prescriptions for impotence meds. “We must advocate for the traditional family,” Turner said, “and ensure that all men using PDE-5 inhibitors are healthy, stable, and educated about their options—including celibacy as a viable life choice.“ Illinois: State Rep. Kelly Cassidy proposed requiring men seeking Viagra to watch a video showing the treatment for persistent erections, an occasional side effect of the little blue pill. As she explained, “It’s not a pretty procedure to watch.” Missouri: Protesting the legislature’s vote to reject Obama’s contraception coverage mandate, nine female lawmakers cosponsored a bill restricting access to vasectomies except for men risking death or serious bodily harm. “In determining whether a vasectomy is necessary,” the bill reads, “no regard shall be made to the desire of a man to father children, his economic situation, his age, the number of children he is currently responsible for, or any danger to his wife or partner in the event a child is conceived.” Oklahoma: When a zygote-personhood bill came before the state Senate, Sen. Constance Johnson penned an amendment declaring that ejaculating anywhere outside a woman’s vagina constitutes “an action against an unborn child.” Bonus: Johnson also suggested that any man who impregnates a woman without her permission should pay a $25,000 fine, support the child until age 21, and get a vasectomy, “in the spirit of shared responsibility.” In response to the same bill, state Sen. Jim Wilson proposed an amendment requiring the father of an unborn child to be financially responsible for its mother’s health care, housing, transportation, and nourishment during pregnancy. Texas: Contesting a bill mandating sonograms before abortions, Rep. Harold Dutton unsuccessfully offered three amendments in a row. The first would have required the state to pay the college tuition of children born to women who decide against an abortion after seeing a required ultrasound image. The second would have subsidized the children’s health care costs until age 18. When that failed, he lowered the age to 6. That didn’t fly, either.

        "articles": "In 2008, Barack Obama padded his electoral vote total by taking on John McCain in states that had been ignored by previous Democratic presidential candidates. He won Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana, and, for good measure, Nebraska’s first congressional district. Now, Glenn Thrush reports, he’s set his sights on an even bigger target—Texas: On the surface, their rationale seems compelling. The state’s population is about 35 percent Hispanic, almost identical to California’s proportion. The voting-age population in Texas is growing faster than almost anywhere else in the U.S. — with an estimated 1.2 million eligible minority voters, most of them Spanish speakers, added to the state’s population between 2008 and 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Those trends have been emerging for a decade, but Democrats have, by and large, been unable to capitalize on them, owing to the state’s geography and abysmal voter registration and turnout patterns among Latinos. Obama talked enthusiastically about contesting Texas in 2008 but virtually abandoned the state to Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain as Election Day drew near, eventually losing by a million votes and 12 percentage points. In the right circumstances—facing off against GOP nominee Buddy Roemer, for instance—Obama could probably come pretty close to winning Texas. It’s a long-shot, though, and realistically, any electoral scenario in which Obama does pick up the Lone Star State’s electoral votes probably has him cruising to reelection pretty easily with or without Texas. If Obama competes in Texas, it’ll be an investment in future Democratic candidates—and a sure-fire sign he’s confident about winning a second term.

        "articles": "<a  Hayworth</a>/AP At a press conference in Birch Run, Michigan, on Tuesday, Donald Trump weighed in on the widely discussed interruption of an appearance by Sen. Bernie Sanders by two black activists last Saturday. “That showed such weakness,” Trump said. “The way he was taken away by two young women—the microphone—they just took the whole place over.” Sanders was campaigning in Seattle when he was interrupted by activists who took control of the stage and the microphone and demanded that people who care about Black Lives Matter also hold the Vermont senator “specifically accountable for his actions.” Sanders left the stage without delivering his planned speech. This is the second time that Black Lives Matter activists have disrupted a Sanders event. Sanders was first disrupted at a Netroots Nation conference in mid-July, as was fellow Democrat Martin O’Malley. Trump, however, promised that such a spectacle would never occur at any of his events, even hinting that he would resort to violence if necessary. “That will never happen with me,” Trump said. “I don’t know if I’ll do the fighting myself or if others will, but that was a disgrace.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "On Friday, day three of Susan G. Komen’s mission/PR clusterf*ck, the group announced it was reversing its decision to defund Planned Parenthood. Well, sort of. What Komen reversed was the claim that PPFA had been blackballed because it was under investigation. The question of PPFA getting further funding is left open until the next grant cycle. Can meet road. This non-reversal reversal was just the latest example of terrible crisis communications that compounded what was a mind-blowingly stupid decision to begin with. How did Komen come to such a terrible decision? (Hint.) Once made, why did they let Planned Parenthood frame it? Why did they wait almost two full days after the story broke—meanwhile hemorrhaging advisory board members, chapters, corporate sponsors, donors, and enduring poignant disappointment at the hands of Andrea Mitchell and Judy Blume fer Christ’s sake—before even attempting to control the damage? These mysteries have all been much pondered, and I won’t do so here again. The question now before Komen is: Can it regain the trust of all those women and men who ran 5Ks and bought boatloads of pink stuff in the belief that this was the best way to ensure breast cancer research, screenings, and treatment? The answer to that question, as to all the previous ones, lies with the board. Source: Susan G. Komen 2009-2010 Annual ReportLet me stipulate: I’ve long had mixed feelings about Komen. Years ago, I edited Barbara Ehrenreich’s “Welcome to Cancerland,” so I was well versed in “pinkwashing,” i.e. corporations donating a miniscule fraction of money earned from peddling stuff adorned with Komen’s pink ribbon to cancer research, or holding a run (after which less than half of the proceeds go to “the cause,” pre-overhead) rather than, say, providing decent health care to workers or keeping toxins out of water supply. I was also aware that Komen had threatened to sue other charities for daring to use “for the cure” in their marketing. That Komen had denied the link between BPA and cancer (while taking in lots of money from BPA makers and users) and generally prioritized “treatment” and “the cure” over “prevention.” But hey, Komen did “raise awareness,” and when you’re talking about a disease that afflicts 1 out of every 8 American women, maybe you take the good with the bad, right? I knew too that the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure™ had purposefully strived for a nonpartisan image (despite the fact that founder/CEO Nancy Brinker was a major Bush funder and ambassador) and that part of that was staying on the sidelines about issues of choice. A perfectly reasonable course. But the board abandoned neutrality when, as part of a larger attack on Planned Parenthood that began with the antics of conservative pseudo-journalist James O’Keefe, pro-life groups began targeting Komen for their Planned Parenthood grants. They were assisted from the inside by new Senior VP for Public Policy Karen Handel, who’d recently run for governor of Georgia on a pro-life and stridently anti-Planned Parenthood platform, and further guided by Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer*. [Update: Handel finally fell on her sword and resigned on Feb. 7.] But all attention that’s been paid to the Handel/Fleischer deus ex machina, however, misses the greater culprit: a sucky board. What do I mean? The board of directors (not to be confused with Komen’s multitudinous advisory boards) currently has nine members. There’s Nancy Brinker, who founded Susan G. Komen in the name of her sister, who died of breast cancer. Brinker is a major mover and shaker in Dallas GOP circles, and a former major bundler, a.k.a. “Pioneer,” for George W. Bush. Also on the board is Brinker’s son Eric. Then there’s Dallas socialite/philanthropist/GOP donor/oil baroness/Junior Leaguer Linda Custard, who chairs the board of the elite Hockaday prep school (once attended by G.W. Bush’s daughters), and serves as a trustee for Southern Methodist University (eventual home to the G.W. Bush Library). Connie O’Neill has a similar portfolio; she notably serves on the school district finance committee of the uber tony Highland Park (the most enthusiastically conservative zip code in the country), as well as the Crystal Charity ball, which is ne plus ultra in the world of rich Texas Republicans (and where O’Neill was coincidentally named one of Dallas’ ten best dressed women). Also in the rich Republicans camp is corporate real estate law firm founder (and Silicon Valley VC) Linda Law, who’s a Republican National Committee Regent, meaning a $250,000+ donor. But wait, there are a few Democrats, including former Nine West executive Brenda Lauderback, who made some modest donations to Obama but is also notable for the number of boards she serves on (Bloomberg Businessweek links her to 51 board members in five different organizations across six different industries). Fellow Obama donor, oncologist Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall Jr., is co-chair of the board, and the only medical professional on it. A bigger Dem donor is lobbyist John D. Raffaelli, whose firm Capital Counsel LLC helps both GOP and Dem causes; he was also the counsel for tax and international trade to former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.). Finally there’s the only board member without any track record of political donation: breast cancer survivor, longtime Komen foot soldier, and VP at a hospital consulting service, Elyse Gellerman, whose job is to represent the Komen affiliates. But my point isn’t about who’s a Republican and who’s a Democrat. The point is that Komen is a giant grant-making operation (nearly $2 billion since 1982) that purports to represent all of womanhood and it’s being run as if it were still a small family foundation. Brinker and son, Custard, and O’Neill all run in the same circles, sit on the same boards, send their kids to the same elite schools. Komen’s board makes a nod to race (both Lauderback and Leffal are African-American), a nod to medicine, and a nod to someone with pull in DNC circles, but the core is a group of rich, Texan, conservative friends. There should be more racial and economic and regional diversity, to be sure. But Komen should, and must now if it wants to regain trust, bring on board members who will challenge the way Komen has done business. Like downplaying environmental factors that would be problematic for corporate sponsors. Like being less than honest with runners and ribbon-buyers about how little of the money raised in those events actually goes to research or treatment. Board members don’t run the day-to-day operations, but they should be (and were) consulted on controversial decisions and they do step in when an organization is in crisis. It’s not likely, but the board’s best move would be to reform itself. Enlist people like Ehrenreich, tech-goddess Xeni Jardin (who’s been chronicling her fight with breast cancer), and Dr. Susan Love, a leading researcher who’s been critical of Komen’s lack of effort toward prevention. Andrea Mitchell wouldn’t hurt either. If you can’t or won’t put them on the board, make sure you somehow capture their POVs. New energy might, for example, persuade the board that it’s time to change the balance between money spent on treatment (7%), screening (15%), research (24%), and “education” (34%). Two decades ago, it was of utmost importance to get women to get over the fear and the shame and into the doctor’s office, to go public with scars and wigs and hot flashes. But mission accomplished, Komen. Now it’s time to put more weight into stopping the disease before it starts. Dig deep enough into Komen’s financial statements, and you’ll find that of the 24 percent they spend on research, only 15 percent goes to explore how to prevent the disease. Pharmaceutical companies probably do a pretty good job of finding new and better chemo drugs; a nonprofit should put more of its clout into research without a near-term financial payoff. New insight might also help the board to grok that if they want to maintain a fig leaf of impartiality in the abortion debate and they bring on Jane Abraham—head of the Susan B. Anthony List; the most powerful pro-life funding group around—to their “advocacy alliance” board, they’d better enlist someone like Stephanie Schriock of pro-choice group Emily’s List as a countermeasure. And a board more savvy to opinions outside of Highland Park might persuade Brinker she should sit back on her Neiman Marcus/Chili’s fortune and not pay herself $417,000 a year plus board-approved first-class travel from the donations of jogging bald ladies and their family members. And for god’s sake, get a better crisis communications team. Or at least a head of communications that has more than 154 followers on Twitter. *This article has been corrected to reflect the fact that Fleischer advised on hiring of other Komen VPs, not Handel.

        "articles": "Suzy Khimm directs our attention today to the latest Gallup Poll about the rich and their taxes. Do they pay too much? Too little? The long-term trend is a pretty spectacular tribute to the power of repetition. After Bill Clinton raised taxes modestly on high earners in 1993, there was a big drop in the number of people who thought the rich paid too little in taxes. That makes sense. But take a look at the next two decades. Capital gains rates on the wealthy were cut in 1997 and the number went down again. In 2001 Bush slashed their taxes and the number went down again. Bush slashed their taxes a second time and the number went down — again. The incomes of the rich skyrocketed during the aughts and the number went down yet more. By 2010, after two decades of skyrocketing incomes and ever-falling taxes, the number of people who think the rich don’t pay enough in taxes has dropped by over 20 points! That’s the power of the Republican message machine, and it’s pretty impressive. In the latest poll, the number finally went up a bit, and I imagine that shows the power of a countermessage. A combination of the continued recession, a louder and more unified Democratic Party, and the Occupy movement were probably responsible for the blip back up. Fighting back can make a difference after all. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Yesterday I wrote about financial industry demagoguery over new rules that will force issuers of mortgage securities to keep a 5% stake in the securities they create. The idea is simple: if they have to keep a small stake, they’ll have an incentive to make sure their securities aren’t loaded up with piles of crappy mortgages of the kind that helped supercharge the housing bubble. However, there’s an exemption for securities that contain only ultra-safe mortgages, and now the mortgage industry is trying to scare everyone into thinking that this is a death knell for any mortgage that doesn’t qualify for exemption. In fact, there’s little reason to believe this: the effect on normal mortgage rates is unlikely to be more than a tenth of a percentage point or so. But while Wall Street’s kvetching about this is predictable, Harold Pollack points out they’ve teamed up with some strange bedfellows: It turns out that the N.A.A.C.P. and the National Council of La Raza are important industry allies in this fight. This is part of a concerning pattern, too. In many cases, respected civil rights organizations and advocacy groups become involved in the political process on behalf of firms whose practices within minority communities raise serious concerns. The Congressional Black Caucus Foundation exemplifies many of these concerns. As the New York Times reported last year, the Foundation’s backers include (among others) Altria, Coca-Cola, Heineken, Anheuser-Busch, and rent-to-own furniture enterprises. The accompanying problem speaks for itself. The NAACP and La Raza make legitimate arguments in the current fight. Perhaps some adjustments should indeed be made in the proposed regulations….Still, I can’t be the only person concerned about what anonymous federal regulators label “the unholy alliance” between the financial industry and some consumer and civil rights groups. If our nation fails to establish strong and enforceable financial regulation, we know whose communities will be left holding the bag. I’m not sure I’d go as far as Harold. I’m not going to swear that the proposed rules are sacrosanct and shouldn’t be modified one bit. But they shouldn’t be modified much, and I don’t think the NAACP or La Raza do make legitimate arguments. It’s simply not the case that anyone without a 20% down payment will no longer be able to buy a house, as they suggest. All the new rules mean is that the cost of loans that aren’t ultra-safe will go up slightly — as they probably should, since recent history suggests they’re riskier than we thought. Alyssa Katz, arguing against the new rules, says: In effect, the costs of managing financial risk that were once borne by the government are now moving to the private sector. I’d rephrase that: In effect, the costs of mismanaging financial risk, which were once borne by the government and have cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in bailouts to Fannie and Freddie, are now moving to the private sector. These risks exist, whether we admit it or not, and consumers end up paying for them one way or another. That being the case, it’s better for them to be accounted for in the loans themselves than to be hidden away in government accounts. Helping low-income home buyers is a worthwhile endeavor, but as Harold says, “This should be done explicitly and carefully, not implicitly by perpetuating industry practices that have proven so disastrous.” Roger that.

        "articles": "Ben Wiseman Ari BermanNovember+December 2020 Issue Before there was a United States of America, there was a postal system. Revolutionaries like Samuel Adams and Thomas Jefferson hatched their plans using underground postal networks known as committees of correspondence. In 1775, a year before the Declaration of Independence, the Continental Congress created the Post Office Department and named Benjamin Franklin the first postmaster general. American democracy expanded with the postal system, one of the only institutions that bound the new nation together and aimed to serve the many rather than the few. The Post Office Act of 1792, signed by George Washington, heavily subsidized the mailing of newspapers, laying the groundwork for an informed citizenry. It also made it a crime for the government to interfere with the mail. When the French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville visited the United States in the 1830s, he marveled at the young country’s postal system—it had twice as many post offices as Great Britain and five times as many as France. The United States’ progressive ideals traveled with the mail. Abolitionists sent anti-slavery publications to the South before the Civil War. The postal system employed women before they had the right to vote, and hired 243 Black postmasters during the 19th century. Ten of the pallbearers at Frederick Douglass’ funeral were mail carriers. There’s a reason why the United States Postal Service remains the most popular government institution, with a 91 percent approval rating. At a time of widening inequality, it costs the same amount to mail a domestic letter no matter where you live. Even in the digital age, the mail remains essential for businesses to serve customers, for seniors and veterans to receive medicine, and for Americans of all stripes to get pandemic supplies like masks—and cast their ballots. Winifred Gallagher, author of How the Post Office Created America, calls it “the central nervous system of American democracy.” Listen to the latest episode of the Mother Jones Podcast: Subscribe using Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or your favorite podcast app. The post office has often been politicized; presidents, most notoriously Andrew Jackson, appointed loyalists as postmaster general and rewarded supporters with postal jobs. But no president before Donald Trump has ever sought to sabotage the institution’s workings to win reelection. Nor has any president installed a postmaster general like Louis DeJoy, the Republican megadonor who in record time instituted a dizzying array of changes—eliminating overtime, displacing 23 top executives, reducing post office hours—that seem designed to further the GOP’s long-term goal of privatizing the post office and its short-term goal of suppressing mail-in votes cast by Democrats. (Following public outcry, he agreed to suspend some of the changes until after the election. A federal judge later blocked other changes, calling them “an intentional effort on the part of the current Administration to disrupt and challenge the legitimacy of upcoming local, state, and federal elections.”) On the day the postmaster general testified before Congress, Trump accused Democrats of using mail-in voting to rig the election. Tom Brenner/Getty Earlier this year, before DeJoy took over, the USPS delivered 590 million pieces of mail to households across the country for the 2020 census, the largest first-class mailing in its history. The census sets the course for the next decade of American democracy: It determines how $1.5 trillion in federal funding is allocated, how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes states receive, and how state and federal legislative districts are drawn. Like the USPS, the census has been around since the country’s founding. Barely 100 words into its first article, the Constitution calls for an “enumeration” of the “whole number of free persons” every 10 years. (Native Americans were excluded from the census until 1860, and Black Americans were counted as three-fifths of a person until the 14th Amendment declared that the “whole number of persons in each state” must be counted.) And like the post office, the census is in unprecedented danger from an administration determined to ignore the Constitution to preserve its own power. Whom the census counts and doesn’t count has always been politically charged. After the 1920 tally revealed that the majority of Americans lived in cities, the rural-dominated House of Representatives refused to use census data for congressional reapportionment for the first and only time in US history. Instead, Congress passed sweeping curbs on immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe to preserve rural white Protestant power. Throughout its history, the Census Bureau has failed to accurately count communities of color. The 2010 census was the most accurate yet, but it still overcounted white people while missing millions of Latinos, Black people, and Native Americans. Until now, however, no administration has sought to manipulate the census to deliberately distort the results. In 2018, the Trump administration announced that it would add a question to the census about citizenship status, a move that seemed certain to depress immigrant participation until the Supreme Court struck it down last year. Undeterred, the administration said it would not count undocumented immigrants for congressional apportionment, a move constitutional experts called a violation of the 14th Amendment. The administration’s efforts to undermine the census have repeatedly been thwarted in court. In September, federal judges temporarily restored the full enumeration period and blocked Trump’s scheme to exclude undocumented immigrants from congressional apportionment. But the damage may have already been done. Experts are warning that the census data could be so skewed that Congress chooses to reject it, like it did in 1920—this time not for sinister reasons, but for the good of the country. “I’m really concerned there might be some really serious errors with the census,” says John Thompson, who directed the Census Bureau from 2013 to 2017. “It’s definitely a possibility. It could be seriously flawed.”In early August, as the Census Bureau was finally dispatching workers to knock on doors in hard-to-count areas after months of delay due to COVID-19, the administration announced that it was cutting census operations short by a month. That gave enumerators less than eight weeks to track down the 40 percent of households that had not yet filled out the census form—disproportionately in communities of color. Trump defended his move to exclude undocumented immigrants from congressional apportionment by claiming that it “reflects a better understanding of the Constitution.” What the administration’s actions really reflect is an emphatic repudiation of the Constitution. The census and the Postal Service are two of the essential domestic governmental operations specifically mentioned in the founding document. Over the past decade, Republicans have passed laws making it more difficult to vote, but Trump’s war on the USPS and the Census Bureau represents a dramatic escalation of his party’s anti-­democratic agenda; rather than pursuing disenfranchisement of people of color and Democrats within the bounds of the Constitution, he’s seeking to eviscerate those limits. He is working to transform long-standing nonpartisan institutions into explicitly partisan ones, shifting their essential mission from serving all Americans to furthering only the interests of a shrinking minority: white conservatives. The extraordinary efforts to undermine the mail and census should prepare us for the possibility of an even more egregious abuse of power to keep Trump in office. Trump’s effort to corrupt core institutions for the benefit of his ruling clique bears an eerie resemblance to the slide toward authoritarianism in other countries. “The practice of taking highly legitimate, effective institutions of the state and politicizing and using them for short-term political advantage is page one of the authoritarian playbook,” says Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard and co-­author of How Democracies Die. By eroding Americans’ confidence in the census, the administration may already be accomplishing its goal of rigging the count in its favor. “The most disastrous thing for the census is that people sit it out because they don’t trust the administration,” says Vanita Gupta, who led the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under Barack Obama and is now president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. The same thing could happen with the post office: If voters are afraid to vote in person yet believe that postal delays will cause their mail-in ballots not to be counted, they may decide not to vote at all. (More than 550,000 mail-in ballots were rejected during this year’s primaries, a huge increase from 2016.) During a testy congressional hearing in August, DeJoy promised, “I am not engaged in sabotaging the election.” The same day, Trump delivered an ominous speech at the Republican National Convention in which he accused Democrats of “using covid to steal an election” by expanding mail-in voting and said, “The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election.” If the census and Postal Service are central functions of the Constitution, free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power are the bedrock principles that define it. Trump has already signaled he may not abide by either. The extraordinary efforts to undermine the mail and census should prepare us for the possibility of an even more egregious abuse of power to keep Trump in office. “A lot of this is laying the groundwork for calling into question the legitimacy of the election in November,” Gupta says. It’s not difficult to imagine an Election Day scenario in which Trump prematurely declares victory based on his lead among in-person votes, which are quicker to tally than mail-in votes in many states and are expected to lean more Republican. Trump then seeks to invalidate the mail-in ballots that favor Democrats before they’re counted. Republican-controlled legislatures in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin intervene on his behalf. In a Bush v. Gore redux, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority cuts the count short or invalidates enough votes to install Trump for a second term. If that happens, the question won’t be whether American democracy can survive Trump. We’ll already know that it hasn’t.

        "articles": "Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.).<a  Skidmore</a>/Flickr Rep. Joe Walsh (R-Ill.), a tea-party-backed freshman lawmaker, recently branded President Barack Obama “a tyrant” for announcing that the Department of Homeland Security would stop deporting certain young illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children. Then, doubling down on his criticism of the president, Walsh took back his use of the word “tyrant”—because, he said, Obama “really isn’t smart enough to know what that means.” Walsh’s remarks were captured by Credo Super-PAC, a political arm of the phone company Credo Mobile. The Huffington Post first reported Walsh’s “tyrant” rant. Here’s the video and text of Walsh’s comments, which he made last weekend at a town hall meeting in Elmhurst, Ill.: “And again, fair is fair, you want a debate on the law, fine, have that debate. But right now it’s a law on the books and you just told your law enforcement people don’t enforce it. I was on one radio station and I said my god he’s a tyrant. I don’t know what else you call him. I don’t want to give him that credit because I don’t think he’s smart enough. I think he’s only doing this because he’s campaigning, that’s all the guy knows. So I don’t want to call him a tyrant, because he really isn’t smart enough to know what that means. But in one fell swoop he just made 800,000 illegal immigrants, let’s call it legal, and gave them the ability to work here legally.” Walsh is one of ten tea-party-affiliated members of Congress that Credo Super-PAC has targeted in this election year. Credo volunteers are following and recording the remarks of the “Tea Party Ten” in their districts. This isn’t the first time Credo caught Walsh stuffing his foot into his mouth. Last month, Walsh was caught on camera saying that the Democratic Party wants Hispanics to be “dependent on government just like African Americans. Activist and former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson,” Walsh said, “would be out of work if [African Americans] weren’t dependent on government.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "<a  Unlike Mitt Romney, most Americans who will pay their taxes today can’t afford fancy accountants. But Romney has reluctantly made public his tax returns, and thus shared valuable strategies to ensure that he pays a far lower rate than, say, Warren Buffett’s secretary. Citizens for Tax Justice recently waded through Romney’s 2010 return—in which his $22 million in income was miraculously taxed at just 13.9 percent—to come up with a handy primer for how you, too, can beat the IRS at its own game. To paraphrase: 1. Don’t work for a living The tax rate on money earned actually working (“salaries and wages”) can be more than double the rate on money earned sitting around watching your investments go up in value (“capital gains”), thanks to the work of other people. Almost all of Romney’s income is taxed as capital gains. 2. If you work, disguise your compensation as capital gains About half of the $15 million in capital gains and dividend income Romney reported in 2010 was actually compensation for his work at Bain Capital. But using a tax loophole favored by private-equity guys, he was able to get paid by taking equity stakes in deals that he put together (“carried interest,” in tax parlance) instead of in the proletarian form of a fully taxable salary. Bonus: This allowed Bain to avoid paying Medicare payroll taxes. 3. Give to charity—but not with cash, checks, or money orders In 2010, Romney was able to write off $1.5 million worth of Domino’s Pizza stock he donated to a charity. It is likely that he originally received the stock as compensation from Bain, in which case the price he paid for it would have been close to zero. In this scenario, by donating the stock instead of selling it and donating the cash, Romney would have saved about $220,000 in taxes. 4. Give to charity—but not now Romney’s return reports income from the W. Mitt Romney 1996 Charitable Remainder UniTrust. Not only is the trust tax exempt, but when Romney set it up 16 years ago, he got a tax deduction for making a charitable donation. Though the money in the trust is eventually supposed to go to charity, Romney can receive income from the trust for a number of years—quite possibly for the rest of his life. 5. Give to charity—your own In 2010 Romney made a tax-deductible, $1.5 million donation to the Tyler Charitable Foundation, which he controls. Commanding your own foundation allows you to curry favor with political and business allies by donating money to their pet organizations and causes. For instance, in 2010 the Tyler Charitable Foundation donated $100,000 to to the George W. Bush Library. 6. Do not invest in America Certain foreign investment vehicles allow you to avoid certain taxes. For example, Romney’s Individual Retirement Account could bypass the Unrelated Business Income Tax by investing through a foreign corporation. Though it’s hard to know whether Romney availed himself of those kinds of savings, he has invested substantially in foreign entities, including ones based in offshore tax havens such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg. 7. Invest in sexy financial instruments Romney earned $415,000 from an investment that gets special tax treatment: Through an accounting loophole, 60 percent of the profits from the investment are treated as long-term capital gains, a designation that has tax benefits, no matter how long the investment is held. 8. Borrow money to invest While you can’t deduct interest from car loans or credit cards, you can write off interest on the money you borrow to make certain types of investments—for instance, if you borrow from a broker to buy stock (a “margin loan”). Portfolio management fees are also write-offs. A fellow like Romney, who makes his millions mainly from investments, could probably deduct a fair sum. 9. Push the limits of the lawWhen you engage in a type of transaction that the IRS views as potentially abusive, you must disclose it in a separate form. In 2010, Romney filed six such forms. 10. Be part of the 1 percentWhen it comes to taxes, it costs money to save money. You’ll need to hire lawyers to help you set up tax-exempt charities and trusts or exploit offshore tax havens—and a professional money manager if you plan to invest in sexy financial instruments. It probably won’t be cost effective if you aren’t already rich, but any hard-working son of a governor can land a job at a private-equity firm and start getting paid in carried interest.

        "articles": "Evan Vucci/AP In any other time, it would have been front-page news and ignited days or weeks of controversy. But last week, when a former top government official accused the president, for whom he once worked, of treasonous conduct, the story lasted nanoseconds and was blown away by the never-ending firehose of craziness and disinformation generated by the commander-in-chief and his crew. The tragedy here is not merely that Donald Trump escaped yet another scandal. It is that a fundamental and dire threat to the security of the United States did not receive sufficient attention and that American democracy remains in immediate danger. I am referring to an interview retired General H.R. McMaster, who served as Trump’s national security adviser after Michael Flynn was bounced, gave to MSNBC, in which he said that Trump was acting like a traitor. This sounds hyperbolic. But how else to frankly characterize McMaster’s remarks? He stated that Trump “is aiding and abetting Putin’s efforts” to intervene in the 2020 presidential contest. This is a helluva accusation being leveled by a man who once was Trump’s most senior national security aide: the president is currently assisting a foreign adversary’s covert attack on the United States. Why did McMaster’s accusation not produce a thunderclap that caused the world to stand still for a moment? There were articles in the New York Times and elsewhere about his charge. But the Times relegated the story to page 14. That’s hardly highlighting the issue. If you blinked, you easily could have missed this damning comment from McMaster, who noted that Vladimir Putin was currently mounting a “sustained campaign of political subversion against us” and that this operation was being “aided by a leader”—that is, Trump—“who doesn’t acknowledge” Moscow’s assault. For months, news reports and Democratic members of Congress have noted that Putin, following up on his successful 2016 attack, is once again trying to sabotage an American presidential election to sow discord and help Trump win. Trump, though, has refused to address this. In fact, Trump and his minions have been blocking, suppressing, or discounting intelligence showing the Kremlin is attempting to subvert the 2020 election. After intelligence officials in February told House lawmakers during a classified briefing that Russia was interfering to boost Trump, an irate Trump ousted Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and replaced him with a loyalist (who was subsequently replaced by another loyalist). Last month, the former intelligence head at the Department of Homeland Security filed a whistleblower complaint claiming that members of the Trump administration pressured him to withhold intelligence assessments detailing Russian efforts to spread disinformation aimed at influencing the 2020 election “because it made the president look bad.” The current director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, has tried to restrict the sharing of intelligence on Russia’s clandestine endeavor with Congress, and the Trump administration has downplayed Russia’s actions, attempting to deflect attention to Iran and China, whose efforts to influence the 2020 election are far less developed and are more indirect. (Ratcliffe also has been declassifying information to assist the latest Fox disinformation campaign, which claims Hillary Clinton and Obama administration conspired in 2016 to tie Trump to Russia. This is nonsense. There was no secret scheme. When Moscow targeted the Democrats with a hack-and-leak operation, Clinton’s aides publicly raised legitimate questions about Trump’s and his adviser’s connections to Russia.) On Tuesday, DHS finally released its delayed annual assessments on threats to the United States—which the whistleblower had claimed had been withheld to protect Trump—and the report stated that “Russia is the likely primary covert influence actor and purveyor of disinformation and misinformation within the homeland.” But in an interview, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf insisted that China posed the greater overall threat to the United States Last week, in another little-noticed development, several Democratic senators demanded that Wolf release a document that shows Trump’s attacks on mail-in voting are “consistent with a foreign influence campaign.” They contended that this unclassified report produced by DHS’ Office of Intelligence and Analysis “demonstrates that a foreign actor is attempting to undermine faith in the US electoral system, particularly vote-by-mail systems, in a manner that is consistent with the rhetoric being used by President Trump, Attorney General Barr, and others.” They did not say that Russia was the culprit, but that’s a good guess. Democrats in Congress have been trying to sound the alarm about Putin’s schemes. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) recently subpoenaed DHS for information related to the whistleblower complaint that alleged intelligence on Russia had been smothered. He also asked the intelligence community to monitor Russian disinformation efforts—particularly those that boost Trump’s criticism of mail-in voting. “Sure enough, it wasn’t long before the intelligence community started seeing exactly that,” Schiff said. “It was too enticing and predictable an option for the Russians. They have been amplifying Trump’s false attacks on absentee voting.” On the Senate side, though, there has been little action. In August, the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee released a massive report that detailed Russia’s wide-ranging efforts to secretly help Trump in 2020. (The report showed that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort colluded with a Russian intelligence officer, that Donald Trump Jr. tried to collude with a secret Kremlin plot to help Trump, that Trump and his aides sought to exploit the Russia attack while denying it was happening, and that Trump likely lied to Special Counsel Robert Mueller.) The committee acknowledged Putin was up to it again in 2020. But it has taken no public steps to address the Russian threat. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, tells Mother Jones, “U.S. intelligence agencies have made clear Russia is intent on interfering in the 2020 election, and yet Republican senators and Donald Trump continue to obstruct any legislation or oversight to respond to the Russian threat. Republicans have refused to even hold a single oversight hearing in the Intelligence Committee this year on how to respond to Russia’s attack on our democracy.” Not one hearing. On October 1, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) tried to cast the spotlight on this brazen negligence. He posted a Twitter thread detailing what he called a “massive coverup campaign underway to disguise the octopus-like Russian election interference operation being run on Trump’s behalf.” Murphy pointed out that in early 2020 intelligence reports started “coming into Congress about a giant, multi-layer Russian effort to help Trump in 2020. Bigger than what they did in 2016. Looks like Russians are trying to get U.S. persons – especially those close to Trump – to help.” In July, he said in this thread, “Dem leadership [wrote] a letter to FBI Director Wray, asking for an all-Congress briefing, especially because the reports we’re reading suggest Russian agents are trying to find Members of Congress to assist their interference operation.” But no such briefing came. Instead, the Trump administration released “vague” statements about possible Russian, Chinese, and Iranian intervention—which, Murphy calls, “very puzzling” because “Congress has never been briefed on any meaningful Chinese/Iranian interference plans.” Murphy also noted that when the Treasury Department in September sanctioned Andriy Derkach, a Ukrainian politician and Russian intelligence officer promoting conspiracy theories about Joe Biden, there was “no press conference from Intel or the FBI or DHS that they’ve caught a Russian agent who has been in regular contact with the President’s inner circle.” Derkach had been in touch with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, who has been trying to collect and spread anti-Biden disinformation. The Trump administration made no fuss about this move. “What’s happening is clear,” Murphy tweeted. “American intel agencies, that are supposed to be totally apolitical, have been folded into Trump’s campaign. They are keeping info about Russian interference hidden, and overhyping info about China and Iran helping Biden.” And Murphy finished with this: “It’s why Trump’s former National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, said something today that is as shocking as it unsurprising. He said Trump is ‘aiding and abetting’ Putin’s interference campaign. Wow. But of course he is. And now you know the details.” Which brings us back to the general and his demand that Trump call out the Russians for attacking the election. McMaster is currently peddling a book, which focuses on his big thoughts about foreign policy. It is not a tell-all about his tenure in Trumpland. But the insight he shared on MSNBC is worth the same sort of attention that was granted to Bob Woodward’s revelations about Trump purposefully downplaying COVID-19. Here is a former high-ranking Trump official stating that Trump is assisting an attack on the United States because he believes that serves his own political interests. McMaster ought to be asked more about this. And he ought to say more. (He did not respond to an email from me in which I posed several questions, including whether he had made any efforts as national security adviser to persuade Trump to take direct actions to protect the United States from Russian information warfare and how much Trump’s “aiding and abetting” assists the ongoing Russian operation.) McMaster’s remarks and the GOP-endorsed Senate Intelligence Committee report are a firm rebuttal to the Trumpers’ long-running shouts of “no collusion” and their cries of “hoax!” Whether or not Trump directly conspired with Russian operatives—Donald Trump Jr. attempted to do so and Manafort indeed collaborated with a Russian intelligence officer—it is now (and has long been) clear that Trump’s great sin in 2016 was providing cover to the Russian operation and taking advantage of it. McMaster’s judgment about Trump’s current actions echo what Michael Isikoff and I concluded in our 2018 book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump: Trump “had aided and abetted Moscow’s attack on American democracy.” The Russia story can seem like old news, and Trump and his amen chorus have done all they could in the last four years to discredit and marginalize this historic scandal. But Putin has again targeted the United States, and Trump is again assisting Putin. A reunion of treachery is under way. Meanwhile, Trump’s GOP handmaids are doing nothing, as the US political system is endangered by an overseas foe. McMaster spoke up in one interview. Yet with Election Day only weeks away, he, other Trump alums, and members of Congress need to do so repeatedly and forcefully for Trump and the GOP’s grand act of betrayal to register during a time of chaos and information overload. Trump is in league with an enemy plotting to infect and undermine a crucial election. And just as he has not protected the nation from the coronavirus, he has not safeguarded the American nation from Russia’s insidious attacks. As McMaster tells it, there is a turncoat in the White House. Other than the pandemic, what could be a greater threat to the United States and more deserving of continuous coverage and dread?

        "articles": "Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) <a  Hagan</a>/Flickr The problems facing North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan next fall are pretty straightforward. She is a Democratic incumbent in a state where Republicans control both houses of the legislature and the governor’s mansion and Mitt Romney won by 100,000 votes last November. She is a top target of Senate Republicans and conservative super-PACs, and when she comes up for re-election next fall she will have to contend with a midterm electorate that’s more conservative than the one that elected her—partly because the midterm electorate is whiter and older, and partly because of soon-to-be enacted laws restricting voting rights. That’s not an ideal electoral climate, but all things considered, it could be worse—North Carolina Republicans could settle on an opponent. Fifteen months before the 2014 election, GOPers in the state are faced with a dilemma. Their only declared candidate has serious baggage—the now-infamous “Motorcycle Abortion Bill,” which snuck a set of strict abortion restrictions onto an unrelated provision on motorcycle helmets. The candidates who voters tell pollsters they prefer aren’t much better. “The Republicans have handed Hagan some levers to assist her in [mobilizing] voters,” says Ferrel Guillory, the director of the University of North Carolina’s Forum on Public Life. If the Republican primary were held today, the front-runner, according to virtually every poll since last December, would be Virginia Foxx, a five-term congresswoman who also has the distinction of being the worst person in Washington to share an elevator with. (Foxx once reported an intern to the Capitol police for accidentally riding on a members-only elevator; no charges were filed.) The real issue with Foxx, though—and perhaps part of her appeal—is that she’s something of a loose cannon. In 2009, she warned that the Affordable Care Act posed a greater threat to Americans than terrorism, because it would result in senior citizens being “put to death by their government.” That was just a few months after Foxx claimed that the story that Matthew Shepard was murdered for being gay was a “hoax.” Foxx has given no indication that she’s actually considering a run, but she hasn’t said she’s not considering a run either. Rep. Renee Ellmers, a former nurse who was elected in the tea party wave of 2010, has also consistently put off a decision on whether she’ll seek a promotion—first to the end of May, then to the end of June, then to mid-July. Now it’s just an open-ended proposition. Cryptically, Ellmers told National Journal in July that she was rethinking her decision on whether or not to enter the race, but didn’t indicate what her decision had been, assuming she’d ever even made one. Ellmers was first elected on the strength of an anti-Islam ad campaign that accused her opponent, former Democratic Rep. Bob Etheridge, of supporting the construction of a “victory mosque” in Lower Manhattan to celebrate the 9/11 attacks. “I am not intending to say that all Muslims are terrorists,” Ellmers told CNN’s Anderson Cooper at the time. She just wasn’t ready to say they weren’t terrorists. That leaves the GOP with one viable candidate who has actually declared, as of late July: Thom Tillis, the top Republican in the state House of Representatives. Tillis formally entered the race at the end of May, but since then his nascent campaign has been bogged down by problems of his own creation—namely, the sharp rightward lurch of the state legislature he helps run. Over the last three months, on Tillis’ watch, North Carolina has become ground zero in a push by conservative lawmakers and interest groups to cut down the social safety net, roll back reproductive rights, and limit access to the polls. At a time when Tillis would otherwise have been repositioning himself for the long electoral slog, he was instead pushing through a set of regulations designed to crack down on abortions. The abortion bill in question, which passed the state house in July, was disguised as a motorcycle safety bill. The controversy came when the law became a Trojan horse for a slate of new abortion restrictions, such as a prohibition on abortion coverage in public employees’ health insurance plans and new regulations that could potentially lead to the closure of some abortion clinics. The bill is deeply unpopular. For weeks, Tillis avoided commenting on the specifics of the legislation at all, but on Wednesday he explained his thinking to the Charlotte News & Observer. “It happens to be something that I support and I thought if I didn’t, they’d say, ‘Why didn’t you?’ so I thought would solve the question by making it very clear where I stood on the bill.” By supporting the law, Tillis stands in the minority—just 34 percent of voters say they approve of it, and Gov. Pat McCrory’s approval ratings have plummeted since the debate began. Hagan’s head-to-head advantage over Tillis has subsequently jumped from 5 points to 11. The motorcycle abortion bill is less restrictive than the original version that passed the state Senate—by way of a repurposed bill to prohibit state courts from applying Islamic Shariah law. That effort, which was criticized by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, would have required abortion clinics to meet the same requirements as ambulatory surgery centers. The kicker: state Senate president Phil Berger, who helped shepherd the bill through the chamber, is also considering challenging Hagan. “I think the absolute worst thing the Republicans can do if they want to beat Kay Hagan is run a leader from the legislature,” says Tom Jensen, the director of Public Policy Polling (PPP). “The legislature has always been unpopular, but it’s never been more unpopular than it is now.” “The legislature has, shall we say, a negative reputation to most anybody except for the Republican base,” adds Steven Green, a political science professor at North Carolina State University. “When you want to win a statewide election, you have to reach beyond that base and somebody associated with the legislature is gonna have a hard time doing that.” The motorcycle abortion flap wasn’t Tillis’ first misstep. At a 2011 constituent meeting he offered his version of a 47 percent speech, expressing his desire to “divide and conquer” people who are on public assistance. “We need…folks to look down at these people who choose to get into a condition that makes them dependent on the government and say at some point you’re on your own,” he said. “We may end up taking care of those babies, but we’re not going to take care of you.” At the same meeting, he flirted with the idea of drug-testing welfare recipients and denying benefits to anyone who tested positive. Brook Hougesen, press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, dismissed the recent polls by noting that PPP’s CEO is a Hagan donor. “Voters will always choose substance over ugly attacks, results over waffling, and no amount of hate can change the fact that Kay Hagan has been the least relevant, least effective, and least productive Senator not only in Washington since her arrival, but in North Carolina’s recent history,” she said in an email. “The only worry for Republicans is that Kay Hagan decides to retire, because she’s been such an ineffective, waffling do-nothing in the Senate.” But Jensen, who polls for Democratic candidates, says Hagan’s prospects are starting to resemble that of another colleague who was once thought to be an endangered species—the Democratic Senate majority leader, Nevada’s Harry Reid, who was able to salvage a reelection victory when conservative activists nominated an anti-fluoride activist to challenge him. “Kay Hagan does have approval ratings that suggest vulnerability, and when you have a situation like that it means her fate ends up tied to the political climate,” Jensen says. “But with the way the field is shaping up, you have the potential where it could still be a bad year for Democrats—and she’d still win.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Amal Hana protests in June 2017 in Detroit after a family member was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a operation targeting Iraqis with deportation orders, including many Chaldean Catholics.Tanya Moutzalias/AP Before Donald Trump became president, Iraqis facing deportation lived in limbo. The US government had ordered them removed—sometimes decades ago—but Iraq refused to take them. So Iraqis like Usama “Sam” Hamama, who came to the United States as four-year-old in 1974 and received a deportation order 24 years ago, continued on with their American lives. In the spring of 2017, their lives were upended when US Immigration and Customs Enforcement began rounding up Iraqis with deportation orders, after the Trump administration said Iraq had agreed to accept deportees. In theory, ICE was now free to detain the Iraqis without violating a 2001 Supreme Court decision that blocks immigrants from being jailed indefinitely when their home countries refuse to accept them. There was one problem: Newly unsealed court documents show that there wasn’t actually an agreement with Iraq. Hundreds of pages of internal emails, memos, and handwritten meeting notes reveal that the Department of Homeland Security aggressively pushed Iraq to accept deportees against their will. With few exceptions, Iraq resisted those efforts and stuck to its policy of not taking deportees unless they volunteered to be returned to Iraq. Throughout those negotiations, ICE officials misled a federal judge by claiming there was an agreement with Iraq that allowed ICE to deport detained Iraqis. “The government has been caught red-handed providing false information to a federal judge,” says Miriam Aukerman, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, which has fought to get the Iraqi detainees released. The deception shaped Judge Mark Goldsmith’s January decision to allow ICE to continue detaining more than 100 Iraqis. If ICE hadn’t hidden key facts, Aukerman says, it is “very likely” they would been released earlier this year. “That’s the real consequence of these lies,” she says. “For more than a hundred people—for more than a hundred families—they’ve lost 2018 as a consequence of the government’s misconduct.” Others have lost even more. More than three dozen Iraqis have given up after enduring months of detention and accepted voluntary deportation to Iraq, where they are at risk of being persecuted or killed. On Wednesday, the ACLU argued in court that in light of the new evidence, the administration should be forced to release Iraqi detainees and strike ICE officials’ false and misleading statements from court records. Khaalid Walls, an ICE spokesman, says in an email that as “a matter of policy, ICE does not comment on pending litigation.” Iraq remains a dangerous place for deportees. Daniel Smith, an Iraq researcher who has been living in the country since 2007, said in a court declaration that Iraqis who return after years abroad often have “extreme difficulty reintegrating” and face “suspicion as a result, leading to violence, arrest, extended detention, and being targeted by armed militias.” The State Department’s website warns, “Do not travel to Iraq due to terrorism and armed conflict.” Many of the Iraqis arrested by ICE are Chaldean Catholics living in the Detroit area, like Sam Hamama. During the 2016 campaign, Trump earned Chaldeans’ support by pledging to destroy ISIS for “hunting down and exterminating” Christians. After the arrests began, their hope turned to panic. Balsam Kinaia, a member of the Detroit Chaldean community, told Mother Jones last June that Chaldeans at risk of deportation would be better off getting killed in the United States because “at least they could be buried here.” (Most of the Iraqis with deportation orders have criminal records, according to ICE.) The story of the government’s alleged agreement with Iraq begins in January 2017, when Trump banned nationals of Iraq and six other countries from entering the United States. In March, Iraq was removed from the list, and a senior DHS official said the removal was occurring in part because the country had agreed to accept deportees. Soon after, ICE deported eight Iraqis on a charter plane, and the agency stopped classifying Iraq as “uncooperative.” In May and June, ICE detained about 200 Iraqis in anticipation of a deportation flight scheduled for later that month. The ACLU sued to stop the seemingly imminent deportations, and Goldsmith quickly agreed to block them. In court, the story the government told Goldsmith and the ACLU almost immediately diverged from what it knew to be true. John Schultz, an ICE official responsible for coordinating deportations to the Middle East, claimed in a July 20 court declaration that Iraq had agreed to accept charter flights of deported Iraqis under a “newly established relationship.” He said ICE estimated that canceling the June charter had cost the government more than $500,000 and added in a November declaration that Goldsmith’s order had caused the cancellation. (The Justice Department successfully blocked the ACLU’s efforts to verify ICE’s claims.) In January, Goldsmith declined to rule that Iraqis’ detention violated Zadvydas v. Davis, the 2001 Supreme Court ruling that blocked indefinite detention of immigrants who cannot be deported. Goldsmith cited Schultz’s statements about increased cooperation with Iraq as evidence for why the Iraqis could be deported, but he had his doubts and ordered the government to begin turning over documents about the alleged agreement. Aukerman says she had a “jaw-dropping moment” when she received some of the early documents. Internal emails showed that Goldsmith had nothing to do with the $500,000 flight cancellation; Iraq’s prime minister had refused to allow the flight before the judge blocked the deportations. Then-ICE director Thomas Homan and a senior Department of Homeland Security official later called the Iraqi ambassador to pressure him to let the flight take place. The ambassador refused, prompting Schultz’s boss to write that ICE had “exhausted” all of its options and had not “even been able to get a new tentative date for the flight.” Other documents released this week show that Iraq almost always stuck to its longstanding policy of blocking involuntary deportations. Before the ACLU took ICE to court, one letter shows, the Iraqi embassy declined to issue travel documents that would have allowed two dozen Iraqis to be deported. (One of the Iraqis was Hamama, whom an immigration judge released on a $100,000 bond earlier this year.) Iraq’s Washington consul wrote that an Iraqi national “should express orally and in writing his willingness to return to Iraq voluntarily in order to be issued a travel document.” Few Iraqis—some of whom were born in refugee camps and have never set foot in Iraq—wanted to leave the United States. On July 20, 2017, the same day Schultz touted increased cooperation with Iraq in a court declaration, an ICE official sent Schultz documents that called for sanctioning Iraq for refusing to accept deportees. An internal memo stated that ICE considered Iraq to be “among the most recalcitrant countries” on deportation and that visa sanctions were the “only remaining avenue available to secure cooperation.” In August, Schultz told his staff to complete the sanctions package, which was never enacted. The head of Iraq’s migration ministry made the voluntary return policy explicit in March 2018, writing in a letter to Iraq’s foreign minister that the “policy of our ministry, since it was established” is to “refuse the principle of forced return of Iraqis abroad or any other nationals, because it conflicts with humanitarian laws and principles.” Two months later, ICE and Iraqi officials in the United States allegedly tried to coerce detained Iraqis into signing forms indicating that they wanted to return to Iraq voluntarily. ICE reportedly told some of them that they would go to jail for five years if they didn’t sign. In June, Goldsmith issued an emergency order requiring ICE to post notices in detention centers stating that ICE cannot force detainees to say they want to go to Iraq. If the government had gotten its way by stopping the ACLU from obtaining the documents, none of this information would have been revealed. “Delay, deny, deceive—in interchangeable order—that’s what has happened in this case,” Aukerman says. “All along.” She adds that the deceptive ICE declarations have also been used to deny bond to Iraqis in other cases. They “did not have what we did for the last nine months,” she says, “which was have a bunch of lawyers working full-time to basically prove these lies.” The ACLU is asking Goldsmith to remove ICE’s misleading statements from those cases as well. Aukerman sees the lawsuit as just one example of how immigration detention remains the “Wild West of the Constitution,” an area where fundamental commitments to liberty and due process are ignored. Immigration detention is supposed to be about facilitating deportation, not punishment. Yet immigrants are often held in jails alongside convicted criminals. “It’s not about removing people,” Aukerman says. “That’s the legal fiction. The purpose is to break people’s spirits so that they will give up their rights and they will return to countries, as our clients do, where they face very, very severe harm.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Sipa USA via AP A strange thing happened last week at the Federal Election Commission, the nation’s watchdog for campaigns and elections. On Friday evening, the FEC’s three Republican members quietly released a slew of missing legal memos related to cases dating back as far as 10 years. The commissioners gave no reason for why they decided to act now, after a decade of silence on the cases in question. But it turns out that the newly released memos were the result of a Freedom of Information Act request recently filed by Mother Jones. The request was a modest one and asked only for a list of all such overdue legal documents at the FEC. That list would show every case for which FEC commissioners had failed to perform a customary part of their jobs: explaining to the public why they had voted a certain way on cases that had come before the agency. Dismiss a complaint, open an investigation, assess a fine—whichever way a commissioner decides, he or she is expected to explain that decision in a memo made available to the public. In a move that perplexed several legal experts, the FEC denied our FOIA request. Yet soon after that, the FEC’s three Republican commissioners hastily wrote and released to the public 11 of these long-overdue legal memos. When Mother Jones asked the three Republican commissioners if our FOIA request had anything to do with their decision to act, two of them, Lee Goodman and Matthew Petersen, confirmed that it had. “Most of these were on the back burner as our reasons were either already clear or changes in the law made the issues moot,” Petersen says. “Your request was a useful reminder to bolster the record with formal statements.” Congress created the FEC in the 1970s to police campaign-related abuses and enforce election laws passed in the wake of Watergate. Unlike most federal agencies, the FEC has an even number of commissioners—six—divided equally by political party. In today’s hyper-partisan environment, with frequent 3-3 deadlocks on key votes, it’s hard not to see the FEC as an institution designed to fail. (The commission will be without a sixth member now that Democrat Ann Ravel has announced her resignation, effective March 1.) But for most of its 40-year history, the FEC worked mostly fine. The commissioners regularly found the four-vote majority they needed to act—to investigate potential wrongdoing, assess fines against lawbreakers, and provide guidance to candidates, committees, political parties, and other outfits looking to get involved in federal elections. That began to change in the mid-2000s. Three new Republicans came aboard who took a more ideological approach to campaign finance laws and free speech. Led by then-Commissioner Donald McGahn, who is now President Donald Trump’s White House counsel, the Republicans often voted in lockstep to block enforcement actions. A Public Citizen analysis found that the FEC hit a 3-3 vote on enforcement actions roughly 1 percent of the time between 2003 and 2007. In 2008, deadlocks rose to 10 percent. In 2013, they hit a peak of 23 percent. “For nearly every case of major significance over the past several years, the Commission has deadlocked on investigating serious allegations or has failed to hold violators fully accountable,” outgoing Democratic Commissioner Ann Ravel wrote in a recent report titled Dysfunction and Deadlock. When FEC commissioners vote on a case to go against what the agency’s lawyers recommend, they are required to publish a legal justification—a Statement of Reasons, in agency jargon—for why they voted the way they did. These memos educate the public on the legal underpinnings of the commission’s decisions and give outside parties a basis to sue the agency if they disagree. But starting in the mid-2000s, the FEC’s Republicans simply stopped explaining many of their decisions. Some or all of the Republican commissioners failed to write Statements of Reasons in 25 such cases over a 10-year span, according to an unofficial tally obtained by Mother Jones earlier this month. (The tally shows that Democratic commissioners had no overdue Statements of Reasons.) Larry Noble, a former FEC general counsel who now works at the Campaign Legal Center, a group that supports tighter political donation limits and more transparency in elections, says that failure to file Statements of Reasons is longstanding problem that has worsened over time. “Delaying them deprives the public of knowing what’s going on or why commissioners did what they did,” Noble says. A few weeks ago, Mother Jones filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking the FEC’s own list of all overdue legal Statements of Reasons. In its February 17 denial letter, an FEC official cited FOIA Exemption 5, which shields from disclosure “documents covered by the attorney work-product, deliberative process, and attorney-client privileges.” Two hours after the denial, the FEC posted its weekly digest. It included the 11 Statements of Reasons authored by Republican commissioners relating to old cases. The documents were all signed and dated within a four-day span last week, and each one is only several pages long, unlike the lengthy, footnote-laden documents typically produced by the commissioners and their staffs. Ellen Weintraub, the senior-most Democratic commissioner at FEC, applauded the release of the 11 legal memos. “I am pleased on behalf of the American people that they are finally getting some kind of explanation for the commission’s failure to act in so many cases,” she says.

        "articles": "The Senate Banking Committee conducted a hearing Tuesday about the massive scandal currently engulfing Wells Fargo. The word “fraud” was used repeatedly by senators on both sides of the aisle when describing the bank’s creation of millions of unauthorized bank and credit card accounts for existing customers. Fallout from the account scandal continues to pile up. The bank is also facing an investigation by the House Financial Services Committee, subpoenas from the Department of Justice, and at least one potential class-action lawsuit. First up at Tuesday’s Senate hearing was Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf, who was grilled by the committee for almost three hours. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren—a longtime advocate for more stringent regulation of Wall Street—tore into Stumpf, describing the unauthorized accounts as a “massive, yearslong scam.” She asked Stumpf what he has done to take responsibility for his bank’s actions. “You have said repeatedly, ‘I am accountable,'” she said. “But what have you done to actually hold yourself accountable? Have you resigned?” Stumpf avoided answering the question directly, prompting Warren to repeat her question, her voice rising, at least three times. Warren proceeded to pummel Stumpf with more questions. “Have you returned one nickel of the money you earned while this scam was going on?” she asked. Stumpf evaded the question several times. (Stumpf said earlier in the hearing that he earned $19.3 million last year.) Finally, an exasperated Warren said, “I’ll take that as a ‘no.'” She then asked if he’d fired any members of his senior management. Stumpf initially began by describing the firing of regional branch managers, but Warren stopped him, emphasizing that her question was not about low-level leadership but about the people at the top. Again, Stumpf’s answer was no. When Warren asked Stumpf if he knew how much the value of his bank’s stock had gone up over the time that the unauthorized accounts were created and maintained, Stumpf replied the information was in the public record. “You’re right, it is all in the public records,” Warren said, “because I looked it up.” She continued: “While this scam was going on, you personally held an average of 6.75 million shares of Wells stock.” The share price went up by about $30 in that time frame, Warren pointed out, “which comes out to more than $200 million in gains, all for you personally.” Warren ended her speech by calling on Stumpf to resign and for both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the CEO. Here’s an excerpt of her speech: You know, here’s what really gets me about this, Mr. Stumpf. If one of your tellers took a handful of $20 bills out of the cash drawer, they’d probably be looking at criminal charges for theft. They could end up in prison. But you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your own pocket. And when it all blew up, you kept your job, you kept your multimillion-dollar bonuses, and you went on television to blame thousands of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich. This is about accountability. You should resign. You should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated. You can watch Warren’s full questioning above. This post has been revised. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Everyone thinks they’re middle class. This isn’t a big surprise: the word “rich” has specific connotations (servants, mansions on the Gold Coast, 200-foot yachts, etc.) and even someone making $200-300 thousand a year probably doesn’t have any of that stuff. What’s more, most people in that income range were likely raised middle class, so culturally they still think of themselves that way even if their incomes give them a pretty comfortable lifestyle. But Catherine Rampell notes something more interesting today. Researchers surveyed 1,100 households in Buenos Aires and asked them a purely objective question: what decile do you think your income puts you in? The bottom decile means you’re part of the poorest 10%, the fifth decile means you’re right in the middle, and the tenth decile means you’re part of the richest 10%. Here’s how things shook out: Fascinating! The very poorest thought they were actually in the fourth decile — just barely below average. The very richest thought they were in the sixth decile — just barely above average. If the same thing is true here — and I wouldn’t be surprised if it were — it could go a long way toward explaining the political dynamics of taxation and economic policy in the United States. After all, if the poor don’t really know they’re poor, they’re never going to mount much of a fight for more egalitarian public policies. And if the well-off don’t know they’re well off, they’re going to strongly resist more egalitarian public policies. The result can be startling increases in income inequality without anyone really knowing it’s happening or caring very much about it.

        "articles": "<a  We are living in boom times for the private prison industry. The Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), the nation’s largest owner of private prisons, has seen its revenue climb by more than 500 percent in the last two decades. And CCA wants to get much, much bigger: Last year, the company made an offer to 48 governors to buy and operate their state-funded prisons. But what made CCA’s pitch to those governors so audacious and shocking was that it included a so-called occupancy requirement, a clause demanding the state keep those newly privatized prisons at least 90 percent full at all times, regardless of whether crime was rising or falling. Occupancy requirements, as it turns out, are common practice within the private prison industry. A new report by In the Public Interest, an anti-privatization group, reviewed 62 contracts for private prisons operating around the country at the local and state level. In the Public Interest found that 41 of those contracts included occupancy requirements mandating that local or state government keep those facilities between 80 and 100 percent full. In other words, whether crime is rising or falling, the state must keep those beds full. (The report was funded by grants from the Open Society Institute and Public Welfare, according to a spokesman.) All the big private prison companies—CCA, GEO Group, and the Management and Training Corporation—try to include occupancy requirements in their contracts, according to the report. States with the highest occupancy requirements include Arizona (three prison contracts with 100 percent occupancy guarantees), Oklahoma (three contracts with 98 percent occupancy guarantees), and Virginia (one contract with a 95 percent occupancy guarantee). At the same time, private prison companies have supported and helped write “three-strike” and “truth-in-sentencing” laws that drive up prison populations. Their livelihoods depend on towns, cities, and states sending more people to prison and keeping them there. You might be wondering: What happens when crime drops and prison populations dwindle in states that agreed to keep their private prisons 80 percent or 90 percent full? Consider Colorado. The state’s crime rate has sunk by a third in the past decade, and since 2009, five state-run prisons have shuttered because they weren’t needed. Many more prison beds remain empty in other state facilities. Yet the state chose not to fill those beds because Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and CCA cut a deal to instead send 3,330 prisoners to CCA’s three Colorado prisons. Colorado taxpayers foot the bill for leaving those state-run prisons underused. In March, Christie Donner, executive director of the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, estimated that the state wasted at least $2 million in taxpayer money using CCA’s prisons instead of its own. That’s just one example of how private prison companies keep the dollars rolling in, whether crime is rising or waning. Not surprisingly, In the Public Interest’s report calls on local and state governments to refuse to include occupancy requirements and even ban such requirements with new legislation. “With governmental priorities pulling public funds in so many different directions, it makes no financial sense for taxpayers to fund empty prison beds,” the report says.

        "articles": "Via Ezra Klein, here’s an interesting chart. CRFB’s Marc Goldwein shows us graphically the difference between the CBO’s “Extended Baseline Scenario” — which assumes current law just goes on forever — and its “Alternative Fiscal Scenario,” which is supposed to be a somewhat more realistic look at what Congress is likely to do in the future. Under the AFS, the budget deficit soars to 360% of GDP by 2050. But under the EBS (the bluish chunk at the bottom, modified to assume our wars end eventually) the deficit stays placidly under control forever: Now, no one actually thinks that the EBS is realistic. Still, this is a fairly dramatic (and colorful!) way of making a point: if Congress just disbanded and let existing law continue forever, there would be no deficit problem. More realistically, if Congress let the bulk of current law continue (i.e., the Bush tax cuts expire on schedule, PPACA cost controls are allowed to take effect, etc.), drew down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and simply agreed to pay for any changes that just have to be made (doc fixes, AMT patches, etc.), there would be no deficit problem. This is not quite as intractable a problem as Republicans would have us think. It’s only intractable if you refuse to pay for your spending. There are more details on all this stuff at the link.

        "articles": "Now that the budget supercommittee has failed in its mission to produce a $1.2 trillion deficit-reduction plan, the Department of Defense must automatically cut $600 billion from its budget within the next decade. As expected, the US defense industry is not happy about this, and its lobbyists have been scrambling for ways to convince Congress that the impending cuts are untenable. So far, one major theme has emerged: Cut spending in our industry, and you cut hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Marion Blakey, CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association, announced that “the cuts in the aerospace and defense portion alone could result in the loss of over 1 million American jobs.” But that’s misleading, according to the Brave New Media Foundation. While the defense industry would lose some opportunities, military spending in fact amounts to a net loss of jobs when compared with government investment in other industries, according to the group’s research. Pumping money into the green energy sector and education field creates far more jobs than defense spending does—in the case of education, twice as many.

        "articles": "Peter Van Buren<a  Meant Well</a>/Flickr This story first appeared on the TomDispatch website. People ask the question in various ways, sometimes hesitantly, often via a long digression, but my answer is always the same: no regrets. In some 24 years of government service, I experienced my share of dissonance when it came to what was said in public and what the government did behind the public’s back. In most cases, the gap was filled with scared little men and women, and what was left unsaid just hid the mistakes and flaws of those anonymous functionaries. What I saw while serving the State Department at a forward operating base in Iraq was, however, different. There, the space between what we were doing (the eye-watering waste and mismanagement) and what we were saying (the endless claims of success and progress) was filled with numb soldiers and devastated Iraqis, not scaredy-cat bureaucrats. That was too much for even a well-seasoned cubicle warrior like me to ignore, and so I wrote a book about it, We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the War for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People. I was on the spot to see it all happen, leading two Provincial Reconstruction Teams in rural Iraq while taking part up close and personal in what the US government was doing to, not for, Iraqis. Originally, I imagined that my book’s subtitle would be “Lessons for Afghanistan,” since I was hoping the same mistakes would not be endlessly repeated there. Sometimes being right doesn’t solve a damn thing. By the time I arrived in Iraq in 2009, I hardly expected to be welcomed as a liberator or greeted—as the officials who launched the invasion of that country expected back in 2003—with a parade and flowers. But I never imagined Iraq for quite the American disaster it was either. Nor did I expect to be welcomed back by my employer, the State Department, as a hero in return for my book of loony stories and poignant moments that summed up how the United States wasted more than $44 billion in the reconstruction/deconstruction of Iraq. But I never imagined that State would retaliate against me. In return for my book, a truthful account of my year in Iraq, my security clearance was taken away, I was sent home to sit on my hands for months, then temporarily allowed to return only as a disenfranchised teleworker and, as I write this, am drifting through the final steps toward termination. What We Left Behind in Iraq Sadly enough, in the almost two years since I left Iraq, little has happened that challenges my belief that we failed in the reconstruction and, through that failure, lost the war. The Iraq of today is an extension of the Iraq I saw and described. The recent Arab League summit in Baghdad, hailed by some as a watershed event, was little more than a stage-managed wrinkle in that timeline, a lot like all those purple-fingered elections the US sponsored in Iraq throughout the occupation. If you deploy enough police and soldiers—for the summit, Baghdad was shut down for a week, the cellphone network turned off, and a “public holiday” proclaimed to keep the streets free of humanity—you can temporarily tame any place, at least within camera view. More than $500 million was spent, in part planting flowers along the route dignitaries took in and out of the heavily fortified International Zone at the heart of the capital (known in my day as the Green Zone). Somebody in Iraq must have Googled “Potemkin Village.” Beyond the temporary showmanship, the Iraq we created via our war is a mean place, unsafe and unstable. Of course, life goes on there (with the usual lack of electricity and potable water), but as the news shows, to an angry symphony of suicide bombers and targeted killings. While the American public may have changed the channel to more exciting shows in Libya, now Syria, or maybe just to American Idol, the Iraqi people are trapped in amber, replaying the scenes I saw in 2009-10, living reminders of all the good we failed to do. Ties between Iraq and Iran continue to strengthen, however, with Baghdad serving as a money-laundering stopover for a Tehran facing tightening US and European sanctions, even as it sells electricity to Iraq. (That failed reconstruction program again!) Indeed, with Iran now able to meddle in Iraq in ways it couldn’t have when Saddam Hussein was in power, that country will be more capable of contesting US hegemony in the region. Given what we left behind in Iraq, it remains beyond anyone, even the nasty men who started the war in 2003, to claim victory or accomplishment or achievement there, and except for the odd pundit seeking to rile his audience, none do. What We Left Behind at Home The other story that played out over the months since I returned from Iraq is my own. Though the State Department officially cleared We Meant Well for publication in October 2010, it began an investigation of me a month before the book hit store shelves. That investigation was completed way back in December 2011, though State took no action at that time to terminate me. I filed a complaint as a whistleblower with the Office of the Special Counsel in January 2012. It was only after that complaint—alleging retaliation—was filed, and just days before the OSC was to deliver its document discovery request to State, that my longtime employer finally moved to fire me. Timing is everything in love, war, and bureaucracy. The charges it leveled are ridiculous (including “lack of candor,” as if perhaps too much candor was not the root problem here). State was evidently using my case to show off its authority over its employees by creating a parody of justice, and then enforcing it to demonstrate that, well, when it comes to stomping on dissent, anything goes. My case also illustrates the crude use of “national security” as a tool within government to silence dissent. State’s Diplomatic Security office, its internal Stasi, monitored my home email and web usage for months, used computer forensics to spelunk for something naughty in my online world, placed me on a Secret Service Threat Watch list, examined my finances, and used hacker tools to vacuum up my droppings around the web—all, by the way, at an unknown cost to the taxpayers. Diplomatic Security even sent an agent around to interview my neighbors, fishing for something to use against me in a full-spectrum deep dive into my life, using the new tools and power available to government not to stop terrorists, but to stop me. As our government accumulates ever more of what it thinks the American people have no right to know about, there will only be increasing persecutions as prosecutions. Many of the illegal things President Richard Nixon did to the famous Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg are now both legal (under the Patriot Act) and far easier to accomplish with new technologies. There is no need, for instance, to break into my psychiatrist’s office looking for dirt, as happened to Ellsberg; after all, the National Security Agency can break into my doctor’s electronic records as easily as you can read this page. With its aggressive and sadly careless use of the draconian Espionage Act to imprison whistleblowers, the Obama administration has, in many cases, moved beyond harassment and intimidation into actually wielding the beautiful tools of justice in a perverse way to silence dissent. More benign in practice, in theory this is little different than the Soviets executing dissidents as spies after show trials or the Chinese using their courts to legally confine thinkers they disapprove of in mental institutions. They are all just following regulations. Turn the volume up from 6 to 10 and you’ve jumped from vengeance to totalitarianism. We’re becoming East Germany. What I Left Behind There has been a personal price to pay for my free speech. In my old office, after my book was published in September 2011, some snarky coworkers set up a pool to guess when I would be fired—before or after that November. I put $20 down on the long end. After all, if I couldn’t be optimistic about keeping my job, who could? One day in October, security hustled me out of that office, and though I wasn’t fired by that November and so won the bet, I was never able to collect. Most of those in the betting pool now shun me, fearful for their own fragile careers at State. I’ve ended up talking, usually at night, with a few of the soldiers I worked with in Iraq. Some are at the end of a long Skype connection in Afghanistan, others have left the military or are stationed stateside. Most of them share my anger and bitterness, generally feeling used and unwanted now that they need a job rather than rote praise and the promise of a parade. We Meant Well is, I think, pretty funny in parts. I recall writing it as an almost out-of-body experience as I tried to approach the sadness and absurdity of what was happening in Iraq with a sense of irony and black humor. That’s long gone, and if I were to write the story today, the saddest thing is that it would undoubtedly come out angry and bitter, too. A Member of a Club That Would Have Me Having left behind friends I turned out not to have, a career that dissolved beneath me, and a sense of humor I’d like to rediscover, I find myself a member of a new club I don’t even remember applying for: the Whistleblowers. I’ve now met with several of the whistleblowers I’ve written about with admiration: Tom Drake, Mo Davis, John Kiriakou, and Robert MacLean, among others. As ex- or soon-to-be-ex-government employees all, when we meet, we make small talk about retirement, annuities, and the like. No one speaks of revolution or anarchy, the image of us the government often surreptitiously pushes to the media. After all, until we blew those whistles, we were all in our own ways believers in the American system. That, in fact, is why we did what we did. My new clubmates represent hundreds of years of service—a couple of them had had long military careers before joining the civilian side of government—and we cover a remarkably broad swath of the American political spectrum. What we really have in common is that, in the course of just doing our jobs, we stumbled into colossal government wrongdoing (systematized torture, warrantless wiretapping, fraud, and waste), stood up for what is right in the American spirit, and found ourselves paying surprising personal prices for acts that seemed obvious and necessary. We are guilty of naivete, not treason. Each of us initially thought that the agencies we worked for would be concerned about what we had stumbled upon or uncovered and would want to work with us to resolve it. If most of us are now disillusioned, we weren’t at the outset. Only by the force of events did we become transformed into opponents of an out-of-control government with no tolerance for those who would expose the truth necessary to create Thomas Jefferson’s informed citizenry. In meeting my clubmates, I learned that whistleblowers are not born, but created by a government with much to hide and an unquenchable need to hide it. One of those whistleblowers, Jesselyn Radack, wrote a book about her experiences called Traitor: The Whistleblower and the American Taliban. At the dawn of the War on Terror, Radack, an attorney at the Department of Justice (DOJ), wrote a memo stating that John Walker Lindh, the “American Taliban” captured in Afghanistan, had rights and could not be interrogated without the benefit of counsel. The FBI went ahead and questioned him anyway, and then DOJ tried to disappear Radack’s emails documenting this constitutional violation. Ignoring her advice, the government tossed away the rights of one of its own citizens. Radack herself was subsequently forced out the DOJ, harassed, and had to fight simply to keep her law license. As proof that God does indeed enjoy irony, Radack today helps represent most of the current crop of government whistleblowers (including me) in their struggles against the government she once served. Radack and I are now working with Academy Award-nominated filmmaker James Spione on a documentary about whistleblowers. What Will Be Left Behind So what’s left for me in my final days as a grounded State Department worker assigned to timeout in my own home? Given my situation, there is, of course, no desk to clean out; there are no knickknacks collected abroad over my 24 years to package up. All that’s left is one last test to see if the system, especially the First Amendment guaranteeing us the right to free speech, still has a heartbeat in 2012. Though I could be terminated by State within a few weeks, I am otherwise only months away from a semi-voluntary retirement. Since I’m obviously out the door anyway, State’s decision to employ its internal security tools and expensive, taxpayer-paid legal maneuvers at this late date can’t really be about shortening my tenure by a meager four months. Instead, it’s clearly about mounting my head on a pike inside the lobby of State’s Foggy Bottom headquarters as a warning to its other employees not to dissent, or mention wrongdoing they might stumble across. Better, so the message goes, to sip the Kool-Aid and keep one’s head down while praising the courage of Chinese dissidents and Egyptian bloggers. The State Department is all about wanting its words, not its actions, to speak loudest. Running parallel to the State Department termination process is an investigation by the Office of the Special Counsel into my claim of retaliation, which State is seeking to circumvent by tossing me out the door ahead of its conclusion. State wants to use my fate to send a message to its already cowed staff. However, if the Special Counsel concludes that the State Department did retaliate against me, then the message delivered will be quite a different one. It just might indicate that the First Amendment still does reach ever so slightly into the halls of government, and maybe the next responsible Foreign Service Officer will carry that forward a bit further, which would be good for our democracy. One way or another, sometime soon the door will smack me in the backside on my way out. But whether the echo left behind inside the State Department will be one of justice or bureaucratic revenge remains undecided. My book is written and my career is over either way. However, what is left behind matters not just for me, but for all of us. Peter Van Buren, a 24-year veteran Foreign Service Officer at the State Department, spent a year in Iraq as team leader for two State Department Provincial Reconstruction Teams. Now in Washington and a TomDispatch regular, he writes about Iraq and the Middle East at his blog, We Meant Well. His book, We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People (The American Empire Project, Metropolitan Books), has recently been published.

        "articles": "Editor’s Note: Nearly three decades ago, this profile by David Osborne offered the definitive portrait of the future Speaker of the House as a young man. As his first ex-wife later put it, Mother Jones “scooped the world on Newt Gingrich.” The article revealed sides of Gingrich that continue to dog him to this day: the reports of infidelity, the now-infamous story of his hospital-room visit with his first wife, and a mile-long trail of aggrieved colleagues. Gingrich later called the article’s publication “one of the saddest things in my public career.” Also: Read our guide to Newt’s 33 years of overheated rhetoric and see 27 years worth of Newt illustrations in the pages of Mother Jones. The original illustration from the November 1984 issue of Mother Jones. Illustration: Rudy Vanderlans Last May, US Representative Newt Gingrich stood in the well of the House to rebut charges made by Speaker Tip O’Neill. For months, Gingrich had been harassing the Democrats in evening speeches broadcast over C-Span, the cable channel that carries House sessions. He called them “blind to communism”; he threatened to “file charges” against ten Democrats for a letter they wrote to Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega; he accused one Democrat of placing “communist propaganda” in the Speaker’s lobby. In retaliation, O’Neill ordered the C-Span cameras to sweep the floor every few minutes to show the world that Gingrich and friends were declaiming before empty seats. And on May 14, he attacked Gingrich for questioning the patriotism of members of Congress. Now the showdown was at hand. The chamber was full, the hubbub audible. Cocksure and articulate, Gingrich repeated his attack on Democratic foreign policy. O’Neill’s words, he said, came “all too close to resembling a McCarthyism of the Left.” He had accused no one of being un-American, he insisted: “It is perfectly American to be wrong.” When Democrats rose to challenge him, he deflected their criticisms, ignored the tough questions, pounced on the easy ones, and demonstrated all the techniques of a master debater. Finally O’Neill took the floor, repeatedly interrupting Gingrich. Back and forth they went, the brash young Republican from Georgia and the indignant white-maned Democrat from Massachusetts. “My personal opinion is this,” O’Neill roared at last, shaking his finger at Gingrich. “You deliberately stood in that well before an empty House, and challenged these people, and challenged their patriotism, and it is the lowest thing that I’ve ever seen in my 32 years in Congress.” Immediately, Minority Whip Trent Lott rose and asked that the Speaker’s words be ruled out of order and stricken from the record. In the House, normally a bastion of civility, members are forbidden from making personal attacks on one another. After five minutes of nervous consultation, the chair ruled in Lott’s favor. That night, the confrontation between Gingrich and O’Neill made all three network news programs. The third-term Republican from Georgia had arrived. Confrontation is not new to Gingrich, and the battle with O’Neill was no accident. Before interviewing Gingrich for this story, I watched him give a speech to a group of conservative activists. “The number one fact about the news media,” he told them, “is they love fights.” For months, he explained, he had been giving “organized, systematic, researched, one-hour lectures. Did CBS rush in and ask if they could tape one of my one-hour lectures? No. But the minute Tip O’Neill attacked me, he and I got 90 seconds at the close of all three network news shows. You have to give them confrontations. When you give them confrontations, you get attention; when you get attention, you can educate.” Nor is it an accident that Gingrich has since emerged in the media’s eyes as a rising star of the conservative movement. In his six years in the House, the 41-year-old former history professor has virtually ignored the traditional goals of a young member of Congress: authoring legislation and steering it through to passage. Instead, Gingrich has concentrated on building a movement capable of remaking the Republican party. In the process, he has created a disciplined band of Young Turks loyal to his leadership, forged a new conservative ideology for the post-Reagan years, and forced his party’s leaders—long content to go along and get along in a House dominated by Democrats—into a more combative stance. This summer, he, along with presidential prospect Jack Kemp, led the successful Republican platform fight that symbolized the ascendancy of the hard Right within the party. Gingrich combines qualities rarely found in one politician: He is a brilliant speaker and debater, he is an effective guerrilla on the House floor, and he is a genuine political strategist and theorist, who by the force of his ideas has begun to reshape Republican politics. David Broder of The Washington Post, the dean of political columnists, touted him several years ago as one of America’s future leaders. Richard Viguerie, leader of the New Right, told me he considered Gingrich “the single most important conservative in the House of Representatives.” Gingrich’s ideology is an unusual blend of hard-right conservatism on economic issues, foreign policy, and the family, tempered by moderation on civil rights, women’s rights, and the environment. What stands out as particularly unique, however, is his fascination with “the future.” Quoting futurists such as Alvin Toffler (The Third Wave) and John Naisbitt (Megatrends), Gingrich believes we are at the dawn of an entirely new era, a leap forward akin to the industrial revolution. His goal is to fashion a political ideology relevant to that future, an ideology capable of creating a new American majority. “I see myself,” he explained, “as representing the conservative wing of the postindustrial society.” Gingrich has coined a slogan to communicate his vision: a “conservative opportunity society”—the opposite, at least in language, of the liberal welfare state. Its three pillars are free enterprise, high technology, and traditional values. But unlike the Republicans of the past 50 years, Gingrich is not content simply to object to every liberal spending program; he seeks to develop a new, positive agenda for the nation. He is not antigovernment, but antiliberal. “I believe in a lean bureaucracy, not in no bureaucracy,” he said. “You can have an active, aggressive, conservative state which does not in fact have a large centralized bureaucracy…This goes back to Teddy Roosevelt. We have not seen an activist conservative presidency since TR.” In many ways, Gingrich is an unabashed probusiness, anticommunist, Moral Majority version of Gary Hart. “The opportunity society,” he predicts, “will answer the cries of the baby-boom generation for a new politics responsive to the future’s needs.” There is a problem here, of course. Baby boomers generally distrust the anti-Equal Rights Amendment, antiabortion, anticommunist politics of the Bible and flag. Gingrich seeks to blur some of these distinctions. He works closely with the Moral Majority, but at times votes against its positions, or is absent on key votes. He opposes the ERA, but maintains that he would support an ERA amended to keep women out of combat, protect noncoed schools, and so on. At bottom, however, he believes that the cultural rebellion of the baby boomers has run its course. Today’s crisis is “a culture in dissolution”: teen-age pregnancy, child pornography, and rampant crime. “I would argue that you can make a very effective traditional values pitch that child pornography is obscene, and that those people ought to be thrown in jail. Most of my baby-boom friends, when they were 18, would have argued intellectually at the coffee house that people ought to be allowed to do what they want to. Now that they’re 37 and they have six-year-olds, they’re real tough on child pornography. “I can carry the baby boomers,” Gingrich boasts. “I could kill Gary Hart in that group, on those issues.” For many who have encountered Gingrich, this is intriguing stuff. His politics clearly hold potential-if not the “opportunity to seize the baby boomers for a lifetime” that he claims, at least the chance to siphon away a portion of the Hart vote. To look into that potential, and to discover more about this new-age Republican, I journeyed to Georgia, whence he hails. A sideburned Newt Gingrich as geography professor at West Georgia College, Carrollton, GA circa 1975. Robin Nelson/ZumaThe Sixth Congressional District, which stretches from the suburbs south of Atlanta into rural west Georgia, fits Gingrich perfectly: It is booming, middle class, and economically revolves around the high-tech Atlanta airport, which vies with Chicago’s O’Hare as the world’s busiest. This is the New South, where spanking new highways crisscross the countryside, shopping centers seem to sprout up overnight, and the sparkle of new restaurants, new businesses and new homes is everywhere. This is the future. The district may be tailor-made for Gingrich, but I was unprepared for what I found in Carrollton, the prosperous west Georgia town where he launched his bid for Congress. I expected great pride in a native son; instead, I found great bitterness. To many of his former supporters, Newt Gingrich is not the cutting-edge politician one sees in Washington. He is a man who campaigned on themes of ethics and morality, then betrayed his words; a candidate who speaks constantly of restoring traditional values, but whose private life tells a very different story. “I will do everything I can to make it possible for the public to hear the whole truth about my record and my beliefs,” Gingrich proudly declared in 1974. In that spirit I set out to discover what was behind the bitterness in Carrollton. Newt Gingrich arrived in Carrollton in 1970, fresh out of graduate school but already a veteran of two political campaigns. Gingrich likes to tell the story of his “calling” to politics. At 15, while in France where his stepfather was stationed, he visited Verdun, where hundreds of thousands of French and German soldiers died in World War I. He stared at the immense pile of bones that could not be identified after the battle, recoiling in horror. “I left that battlefield convinced that men do horrible things to each other, that great nations can spend their lifeblood and their treasure on efforts to coerce and subjugate their fellow man,” he later wrote. The next fall, he handed in a 180-page paper on the balance of world power, and announced to his astonished English teacher that his family was moving to Georgia, where he would “form a Republican party and become a congressman.” “It was the most amazing decision of my life,” Gingrich later told a reporter. “And it gives me certain inner strengths that other politicians don’t have, because I see this as a calling, as something that someone has to do if America is to keep the freedoms we believe in.” “He always thought big thoughts,” says Chip Kahn, who met him when Gingrich was a grad student at Tulane, in New Orleans. “We would talk for hours about what being a leader was all about, what leadership meant, what politics were all about…He would tell me about talking with Jackie [his wife] about what would happen if she or the kids were kidnapped. He thought he would be in a position of power someday, and might have to make decisions about things like that. He knew he would have to be tough. He and Jackie agreed that if it came down to that, he would have to make decisions for the society, not for his family.” This grandiose vision was not idle dreaming; it was part and parcel of Gingrich’s personality. He was confident, ambitious, often arrogant. When he arrived at Baker High School, in Columbus, Georgia, he made an instant impression on his classmates by regularly thrusting his hand into the air and announcing, “Question here!” Like a number of his classmates, he also developed a crush on his math teacher. But unlike the other boys his age, Gingrich didn’t leave it at that. She moved to Atlanta; he enrolled at Emory University. One day, Jackie recalls, there was a knock on her door, and there stood Gingrich, seven years her junior. She still remembers the conversation: “I’m here,” he announced. “Yeah?” “Yeah, I came. I’m here.” “He had made up his mind,” she says with a smile. “We dated and went together for that year his freshman year in school, and we got married the next June.” Newt Was always very “persistent, and persuasive.” By the time they reached Carrollton, eight years and two daughters later, the grand plan was well under way. In 1964 Gingrich had managed a congressional campaign; in 1968 he had coordinated Nelson Rockefeller’s presidential campaign in the Southeast. In 1971, after a year on the faculty of West Georgia College, he stunned his colleagues by applying, unsuccessfully, for the chair of his department. Later he considered applying for the college presidency. If he shocked his friends by announcing his congressional candidacy, that was the least of it. “During the first campaign back in ’74, Newt told me he was going to be the kind of congressman that David Broder would come to and like, that he would be the kind of congressman that the media would turn to when they wanted to know what the thinking people in the Republican party wanted to do,” says Lee Howell, his press secretary in 1974. “He said, ‘I’m going to be one of the intelligentsia who sets the course for this party.’ He said that in 1974, when I was still laughing about the fact that he was running for Congress. Sure enough, in the space of a few years, he has achieved all that.” Gingrich told several intimates in 1974 that his goal was to be Speaker of the House. But Chip Kahn, who ran his first two campaigns and knows him as well as anyone, says his ambitions are loftier than that: “Newt understands the basic principle that one should never say you want to be president. People don’t like somebody at that stage of their life: to be playing that game. But he will be whatever he can be, as high as he can go.” Though too cocky for some of his faculty colleagues, Gingrich was a popular figure on campus. His classes were exciting, experimental, unorthodox. He organized an environmental studies program and used it to teach the future. He loved the role of instructor, loved being the center of attention. “Newt was always pretty much the way he is now,” remembers a close friend. “If we got together at his house, after a movie, he wanted center stage. He’d turn a social situation into a forum; he really turned my wife off that way. He’s always had a big ego—which made him electable.” At the time, remembers Lee Howell, then editor of the student newspaper, Gingrich had “moddish” long hair and the tolerant cultural views of a young professor. He would come down to the newspaper office to talk and have a beer (though liquor was not allowed there), or have students over to his house for long philosophical discussions. He didn’t mind if people drank, others remember, or even smoked a little dope. One of his friends lived with a girlfriend, and Gingrich provided emotional support for another couple going though an abortion. To people on campus, Gingrich was a young liberal. There were so few Republicans in Georgia, and the Democrats were so conservative, that his Republicanism didn’t typecast him. When he ran against Representative John Flynt in 1974 and 1976, Gingrich postured as the young reformer against Flynt, the aging, corrupt conservative. Gingrich’s big issues were ethics—thanks to Watergate and Flynt’s problems—and the environment. In 1976 he sought endorsements from both the liberal National Committee for an Effective Congress and the conservative Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress. He didn’t talk much about the ERA or abortion. “In 1974 I wrote this speech for his opening night kick-off,” remembers Howell. “I come from a Southern Protestant background, and Southern Protestants quote the Bible. Newt had me take out all the references to God, because he was not very religious—and isn’t very religious. He went to church in order to get a nap on Sunday morning. He became a deacon because of who he was, not what he believed. He did not like us to use God in his speeches; he didn’t want people to think he was using God, because he said that would be hypocritical. He said, ‘I’m not a very strong believer.”‘ In his speeches today, Howell adds, “he uses God quite regularly.” Gingrich did, however, talk a great deal about ethics, traditional values, and the family. “America needs a return to moral values,” his literature announced, showing photos of the young candidate and his family and describing his church activities as a deacon and as a Sunday school teacher. His wife, Jackie, campaigned hard for him, covering hundreds of miles, visiting country stores, handing out leaflets at high school football games. “Everyone saw Jackie and Newt as a unit,” says Mary Kahn, who covered Gingrich as a reporter before marrying Chip. “He was always talking about the family being a team, about family values. It was a constant, and a big part of his campaign.” Meanwhile, Gingrich’s own behavior was painting a different picture. During or soon after the 1974 campaign, several of his closest advisors realized he was having an affair. After the campaign, Gingrich seriously considered divorce. He and Jackie went to see a marriage counselor, however, and finally decided to work it out. This was not an isolated incident, according to others who were close to Gingrich at the time. One former aide describes approaching a car with Gingrich’s daughters in hand, only to find the candidate with a woman, her head buried in his lap. The aide quickly turned and led the girls away. Another former friend maintains that Gingrich repeatedly made sexual advances to her when her husband was out of town. On one occasion, he visited under the guise of comforting her after the death of a relative, and instead tried to seduce her. In certain circles in the mid-1970s, Gingrich was developing a reputation as a ladies’ man. He was also developing a reputation as an effective but hard-luck candidate: In 1974 he ran into Watergate, which decimated the Republicans; in 1976 Georgia’s own Jimmy Carter topped the Democratic ticket. Both times Gingrich came within 2 percent of victory. Then in 1978 John Flynt retired. This was Gingrich’s year. With the ultraconservative Flynt gone and both the tax revolt and the fundamentalist New Right dominating the national scene, Gingrich swung right. “By ’78,” says Chip Kahn, “Newt was rock-hard conservative. He emphasized different things—he talked about welfare cheaters, he painted Virginia Shapard [his Democratic opponent] like she was a liberal extremist. On some of the social issues, he moved when he realized how central they were to the Republicans. It took him a while to figure that out. Newt understands waves, and he rides waves.” Gingrich also understands “negative” campaigning. In 1978 he hired Deno Seder, renowned for his hardhitting television spots. “We went and found three inconsequential bills that Shapard had voted against in the Georgia Senate-bills that were so badly drawn that nobody in their right mind would have voted for them,” remembers L. H. (Kip) Carter, Gingrich’s campaign treasurer from December 1974 through 1978. “One was to cut taxes. It was a horrible bill, and she voted against it. So I conceived this ad—it was a spotlight shining on a white piece of paper. A male arm comes out in a pinstriped suit, obviously somebody that you can believe and trust, and lays down this Senate bill. And a voice-over says, ‘Virginia Shapard had a chance to cut your taxes. She knows how she voted; she only hopes you don’t.’ And then we got this fat arm-Virginia Shapard was a little on the hefty side with an iron bracelet that looked like it belonged to Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS, and this big fat hand came out and stamped a big ‘No’ in the middle of the bill. We slaughtered her with that ad. And it was really unfair.” Another ad showed a similarly hefty arm pulling dollar bills out of a pile. The voice-over charged Shapard with giving money away to welfare people. Campaign literature referred to her as the wife of a wealthy textile magnate, a woman who had gone to “private schools.” It failed to mention, however, that the private school she attended was a college, which made her no different than Gingrich himself. To top it off, Gingrich seized upon the fact that Shapard, whose husband ran a business in the district, planned not to uproot her family if elected, but to commute to Washington (as Geraldine Ferraro has for six years). “I drew up an ad—I feel embarrassed about this—where I showed a picture of her family and Newt’s family, and I said, ‘This time you have a choice,'” remembers Carter. In a list of contrasts, under the Shapard photo the ad said: “If elected, Virginia will move to Washington, but her children and husband will remain in Griffin.” Under the Gingrich photo: “When elected, Newt will keep his family together.” Newt in the 1980s as a US congressman in Newnan, Georgia. Robin Nelson/Zuma Despite the solid family-man advertising pitch, however, some of Gingrich’s associates could sense what was coming On election night, several of them took bets on how long his marriage would last. Unknown to them, the Shapard campaign staff was doing precisely the same thing. It seemed plain to many that while Gingrich had used his wife to get elected, he would now consider her a liability. “Jackie was kind of frumpy,” explains Lee Howell, who asked Gingrich to be his best man in 1979 but pulls no punches about his friend’s divorce. “She’s lost a lot of weight now, but she was kind of frumpy in Washington, and she was seven years older than he was. And I guess Newt thought, well, it doesn’t look good for an articulate, young, aggressive, attractive congressman to have a frumpy old wife.” The winning bet, as it turned out, was 18 months. In April of 1980, the candidate who had promised to “keep his family together” told his wife he was filing for divorce. According to sources in whom Gingrich confided at the time, he was already having an affair with the woman he later married. When I asked Gingrich about this, he did not deny it. “I’m not going to get into those details or the questions about 1974. I think there is a level of personal life that is personal…I had married my high-school math teacher two days after I was 19. In some ways it was a wonderful relationship, particularly in the early years…But we had gone through a series of problems—which I regard, I think legitimately, as private—but which were real. There was an 11-year history prior to my finally breaking down, and short of someone writing a psychological biography of me, I don’t think it’s relevant.” Private behavior becomes relevant, I suggested, when it contradicts the rhetoric on which a public official has been elected. “Looking back, do you feel your private life and what you’d been saying in public were consistent?” “No,” Gingrich answered. “In fact I think they were sufficiently inconsistent that at one point in 1979 and 1980, I began to quit saying them in public. One of the reasons I ended up getting a divorce was that if I was disintegrating enough as a person that I could not say those things, then I needed to get my life straight, not quit saying them. And I think that literally was the crisis I came to. I guess I look back on it a little bit like somebody who’s in Alcoholics Anonymous—it was a very, very bad period of my life, and it had been getting steadily worse…I ultimately wound up at a point where probably suicide or going insane or divorce were the last three options.” The divorce turned much of Carrollton against Gingrich. Jackie was well loved by the townspeople, who knew how hard she had worked to get him elected-as she had worked before to put him through college and raise his children. To make matters worse, Jackie had undergone surgery for cancer of the uterus during the 1978 campaign, a fact Gingrich was not loath to use in conversations or speeches that year. After the separation in 1980, she had to be operated on again, to remove another tumor While she was still in the hospital, according to Howell, “Newt came up there with his yellow legal pad, and he had a list of things on how the divorce was going to be handled. He wanted her to sign it. She was still recovering from surgery, still sort of out of it, and he comes in with a yellow sheet of paper, handwritten, and wants her to sign it. “Newt can handle political problems,” Howell says, “but when it comes to personal problems, he’s a disaster. He handled the divorce like he did any other political decision: You’ve got to be tough in this business, you’ve got to be hard. Once you make the decision you’ve got to act on it. Cut your losses and move on.” People in Carrollton were particularly incensed by the fact that Jackie was left in difficult financial straits during the separation, after her surgery. According to Lee Howell, friends in her congregation had to raise money to help her and the children make ends meet, and Jackie finally had to go to court for adequate support, before the divorce decree. In his financial statement, Gingrich reported providing only $400 a month, plus $40 in allowances for his daughters. He claimed not to be able to afford any more. But in citing his own expenses, Gingrich listed $400 just for “Food/dry cleaning, etc.”—for one person. The judge quickly ordered him to provide considerably more. When an article on the hearing appeared in the local paper, many in town were incensed. On election day, a few weeks later, Gingrich’s winning margin in Carroll County fell from 66 percent in 1978 to 51 percent. In part because of the divorce, in part because of the way he dealt with others, Gingrich has left behind him a string of disillusioned friends and associates, many of whom are now willing to air their feelings. Listen, for instance, to Lee Howell, who is still friendly with Gingrich: “Newt Gingrich has a tendency to chew people up and spit them out. He uses you for all it’s worth, and when he doesn’t need you anymore he throws you away. Very candidly, I don’t think that Newt Gingrich has many principles, except for what’s best for him, guiding him.” Or Chip Kahn, who ran two of his campaigns and has-known him for 16 years: “I don’t know whether the ambitious bastard came before the visionary, or whether because he’s a visionary, he realizes you have to be tough to get where you need to be.” Or Mary Kahn: “Newt uses people and then discards them as useless. He’s like a leech. He really is a man with no conscience. He just doesn’t seem to care who he hurts or why.” L.H. Carter was among Gingrich’s closest friends and advisors until a falling out in 1979. “You can’t imagine how quickly power went to his head,” Carter says. The first time Gingrich flew back to the district, Carter remembers, he “pitched a fit” because Carter was still walking up to the gate to greet him when he arrived, rather than standing and waiting for him. Soon after, they were discussing a supporter who had complained to Gingrich about one of his votes. “I was sort of chiding him about not staying in touch with ‘the people’,” Carter says. “He turned in my car and he looked at me and he said, ‘Fuck you guys. I don’t need any of you anymore I’ve got the money from the political action committees, I’ve got the power of the office, and I’ve got the Atlanta news media right here in the palm of my hand. I don’t need any of you anymore.'” “The important thing you have to understand about Newt Gingrich is that he is amoral,” says Carter. “There isn’t any right or wrong, there isn’t any conservative or liberal. There’s only what will work best for Newt Gingrich. “He’s probably one of the most dangerous people for the future of this country that you can possibly imagine. He’s Richard Nixon, glib. It doesn’t matter how much good I do the rest of my life, I can’t ever outweigh the evil that I’ve caused by helping him be elected to Congress.” Gingrich knew that I had talked to people like Carter and the Kahns. As a parting thought during our second interview, he told me, “I have worked very, very hard to be in a position to help the country save itself and this is a very, very tough business. And I would say that along the way I’ve made a lot of friends and a lot of enemies. Hopefully up to now it’s been marginally more friends.” In July of 1983, Gingrich made a name for himself in the House by demanding that Representatives Daniel Crane and Gerry Studds be expelled for having affairs with House pages. “A free country must have honest leaders if it is to remain free,” he proclaimed. “We are in deep trouble as a society… People are looking for a guidepost as to how they should live, how their institutions should behave, and who they should follow.” “Our decisions are not made today about two individuals; our decisions are made today about the integrity of freedom, about belief in our leaders, about the future of this country, about what we should become.” For many in Carrollton, the hypocrisy of these statements was too much. “I understood totally that in my hometown and among people who knew me, there would be a lot of people who would be very cynical and would say, ‘Who does he think he is?”‘ Gingrich admits today. “And part of my conclusion is the same one I’m sure you run into. If the only people allowed to write news stories were those who had never told a lie, we wouldn’t have many stories. If the only people allowed to serve on juries were saints, we wouldn’t have any juries. And I thought there was a clear distinction between my private fife, and the deliberate use of a position of authority to seduce and abuse somebody in your care. And I would draw that distinction. “I would say to you unequivocally—it will probably sound pious and sanctimonious saying it—I am a sinner. I am a normal person. I am like everyone else I ever met. One of the reasons I go to God is that I ain’t very good—I’m not perfect. “ Gingrich cleverly sidesteps the real issue, which is not his private life, but the fact that he misled his constituents, publicly campaigning as a crusader for traditional morality while making a sham of that morality in his own life. If he preaches one thing and does another when it comes to moral issues, his constituents have a right to ask how far his views can be trusted on other subjects. How sound are Newt Gingrich’s ideas about the nation’s future? Is there more than a touch of fraudulence here as well? Let us examine the key issues Gingrich has pushed this year, beginning with his insistence that the budget could be balanced without tax increases. In his new book, Window, of Opportunity, Gingrich proposes at least a dozen new or expanded federal programs, plus several new tax breaks. When I suggested to him that the price tag would be $75 billion to $100 billion a year he did not flinch. Yet the book avoids specific proposals for cutting the budget. There is a chapter titled “Why Balancing the Budget Is Vital,” but as Gingrich’s former aide Frank Gregorsky puts it, “There’s a declaration of war, but there’s no ammo in the gun.” Gingrich and I spent the first half hour of our interview discussing this question. He laid out what he claimed would total $40 billion to $50 billion a year in budget cuts, which might balance some of his spending programs and tax cuts. He then briefly described a program calling for a simpler, less progressive tax system; elimination of waste in government; new “delivery systems” for government services, taking advantage of new technologies; and monetary and interest reforms. He made clear that on some of this—such as monetary and interes t rate reform—his understanding was quite casual. Yet several days later he unveiled the package at a press conference and announced that it would “almost certainly” balance the budget by 1989. Gingrich cheerfully admits that his entire economic agenda rests on the assumption that the US economy can average 5 to 6 percent annual growth—including recession years—for close to a decade, filling federal coffers without a tax increase. Look at “Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, West Germany for 20 years, the United States in the 19th century-there are times and places where you have that,” he told me. In an article on the subject, he pointed to the 5.5 percent annual growth in the US between 1962 and 1967—neglecting to mention that the period fell between recessions, which would bring the average down, and that this spurt of growth, fueled in part by federal spending on the Vietnam War, was so rapid that it touched off the inflation we experienced in the 1970s. In the same article, he claimed we could simultaneously keep inflation down to 2 percent a year. From 1970 through 1983, our average annual GNP growth—after inflation—was only 2.5 percent. Why would we suddenly come out of such a period into record growth? Gingrich’s answer is instructive: “The whole point of Toffler’s Third Wave and Naisbitt’s Megatrends and Peters and Waterman’s In Search of Excellence and Drucker’s Age of Discontinuity is we don’t know crap about the near future. We are on the edge of an explosion in space and biology, and in electronics we’re going through a revolution in computers. If we are creative, we are potentially where Britain was at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. We’re on the edge of a take-off into what Toffler called the Third Wave.” In other words, we should bet the farm on Gingrich’s optimistic interpretation of futurists such as Toffler—who made it clear after endorsing Gingrich’s book that he does not agree with all of his politics. But even if Gingrich is right about technology—a dubious proposition in itself—that says nothing about economics. An explosion of technology in agriculture, during the teens and twenties, threw many people out of work and weakened consumer demand, helping to trigger the Depression. Some economists fear a similar impact from computer technologies, which make so much labor obsolete. In addition, Gingrich’s rosy view ignores the short-term impact of the deficit, which has already pushed real interest rates to historic highs. If those rates go much higher next year, as economists predict, we may have another recession. At that point, the deficit could hit $250 billion a year with interest on the debt snowballing so fast that the gap might never be closed. Gingrich prefers to take our chances, however, betting on a decade of growth the likes of which we have not seen in this century. Next, consider the issue of prayer in the schools. When speaking for this cause, Gingrich always describes the goal as “voluntary prayer”—ignoring the fact that students are already free to pray on their own, voluntarily. He maintains that current Supreme Court interpretation of the law does not even allow students to pray before eating their lunches, or to read their Bibles at school—both of which are simply false. “The need for a moral revival is a major factor in my commitment to voluntary prayer in school,” Gingrich writes. “For a generation, the American people have allowed a liberal elite to impose radical values and flaunt deviant beliefs.” In a US News & World Report interview, he went so far as to claim that “our liberal national elite doesn’t believe in religion.” Making preposterous statements such as this allows Gingrich to set up a devil—the “liberal welfare state,” run by the “liberal national elite”—and blame it for the decline of moral values in America. Gingrich knows better, however. In our interview, I asserted that the roots of moral decline lay not in our government, but in our consumer society; which is constantly bombarding us with a glorification of instant gratification, hedonism, sensuality, and the self. In discussing Gingrich with people who know him well, I heard over and over how adept he is at telling people what they want to hear. And sure enough, Gingrich agreed with me, simply redefining “liberal welfare state” to mean the entire society. If our consumer society is to blame, I next pointed out, the problem lies within private enterprise. “Oh yeah,” he again agreed.. “But see, I’m not a libertarian. I say it pretty clearly in the book, I am not for untrammeled free enterprise. I am not for greed as the ultimate cultural value.” In the book, however, there is no emphasis on regulating private enterprise or forcing corporations to change the advertising messages they constantly beam into our living rooms. How would he deal with the problem? By “preaching a collection of values which over time people come to believe are true. It is closer to a religious, educational… it’s moral leadership.” And so we come full circle. A congressman who seems to keep two different sets of books when it comes to matters of morality would lead us in a moral crusade. Such are the ironies of American politics.

        "articles": "Chip Somodevilla/CNP/ZUMA Friday marks the end of President Donald Trump’s first week in office. In just that short time, the new commander in chief and his administration have managed to produce an extraordinary amount of alarm in the United States and abroad. Concerns have ranged from a series of executive actions and efforts to gag federal agencies to Trump’s penchant for promoting bewildering falsehoods and his obsession with his own popularity. It’s been a lot to take in, so here’s a brief run-down of just some of what’s happened over the last week: Friday, Obamacare Repeal: In one of his first moves as president, Trump fulfilled one of his campaign’s biggest promises to begin steps to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. A replacement plan, however, has yet to be revealed. Republican leaders are reportedly scrambling to introduce one by the spring. Saturday, First of Several Leaks: Despite Trump’s push to silence his critics and control messaging, there have been a number of leaks coming from within his inner circle. Some fascinating details include confirmation he was infuriated by social-media posts about his disappointing inauguration numbers, aides worried about Trump’s constant television watching, and reports he “blindsided” his own CIA director and defense secretary about an executive order draft to use torture practices again. Sunday, “Alternative Facts”: During an appearance on Meet the Press on Sunday, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway defended press secretary Sean Spicer’s fiery press conference in which he insisted Trump’s inauguration had a larger crowd attendance than Barack Obama’s 2009 ceremony. Conway described Spicer’s false statement as “alternative facts.” Monday, Abortion Funding Ban: Trump reinstated a “global gag rule” prohibiting US aid to international groups that offer or promote abortions. The return of the so-called Mexico City Policy came just two days after millions of women participated in women’s marches across the world to protest Trump’s presidency. China Escalation: In his first official press briefing on Monday, Spicer said Trump was considering ways to “protect our interests” in the South China Sea. The comments sparked alarm in China, where its government asserts it has an “irrefutable” claim to territorial islands. “The United States is not a party to the South China Sea dispute,” a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. Obsession with Nonexistent Voter Fraud During a closed-door meeting with congressional leaders on Monday, Trump resurrected the widely debunked claim that he lost the popular vote because millions of undocumented immigrants illegally voted for Hillary Clinton. The next day, Spicer confirmed that the president still believed in the unsubstantiated claim that voter fraud cost him the popular vote. On Wednesday, Trump took his claim to both Twitter and national television, threatening he may launch a “major” investigation into the falsehood. I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017 Tuesday, Pipelines Return: Among his flurry of executive actions this week, Trump signed orders to revive the construction of both the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. The Obama administration had previously halted the controversial projects because of environmental concerns and mounting protests. Environmental Protection Agency Freeze: Trump’s administration ordered a temporary freeze on all EPA grants and contracts. All EPA studies must now also be reviewed by members of the Trump administration, many of whom are well-known climate change deniers, before they go public. Wednesday, Border Wall: In another executive order signed on Wednesday, Trump called for the immediate construction of a massive border wall to be built along the US-Mexico border. The move, along with Trump’s continued demand that Mexico pay for the project, prompted President Enrique Peña Nieto to cancel a meeting at the White House on Thursday. Esta mañana hemos informado a la Casa Blanca que no asistiré a la reunión de trabajo programada para el próximo martes con el @POTUS. — Enrique Peña Nieto (@EPN) January 26, 2017 Refugees and Immigration: It was also reported on Wednesday that Trump is expected to sign several pieces of executive orders halting immigration from certain countries that include Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Yemen. The administration is also likely to place a ban on refugees from resettling to the United States. United Nations Funding: According to a New York Times report published on Wednesday, Trump is expected to sign orders dramatically reducing US funding to several international organizations, most notably the United Nations. The move would be consistent with his campaign’s assertion that the United States pays an exorbitant amount for its role in global organizations without much in return. Trump has also accused the United Nations of not being an ally to Israel. Thursday, Relocating US Embassy to Jerusalem: As reports swirl of Trump’s serious intentions to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the Palestine Liberation Organization on Thursday vowed to revoke its recognition of Israel if the president follows through on his controversial campaign promise. Senior State Department Exodus: The Trump administration asked several senior staff members of the State Department to step down from their posts.

        "articles": "Over the weekend, a picture of New Jersy Gov. Chris Christie dressing down a teacher who asked him about school budgets went semi-viral. I was a little surprised, because I thought Christie had stopped doing this kind of thing as his national ambitions became more obvious. Apparently not. But Dave Weigel, who snapped the pics, provides a tidbit of interesting background: Mary Pat Christie smiled through the entire talk-off. Why? Because a local NBC News camera was facing at her, capturing the scene. Two days later, I don’t see any trace of the video online. Is that a statement on how ordinary the confrontation was? Possibly. I think it’s also a reflection of the frontrunner coverage boosting Christie as the race ends, as the polls showing him winning (with up to 37 percent of voters not even knowing who is opponent is) are taken as prima facie evidence that he’s running a faultless campaign. The day after this little contretemps, one of north Jersey’s major papers ran an analysis of how the governor’s tone had moderated so much recently. Back in early 2012, when the chatter about Christie’s presidential chops first started, I remember thinking that I just didn’t believe it. Obviously Christie has some ideological baggage, but that wasn’t my big reason for skepticism. It was his famous bullying of ordinary citizens. Sure, it went over great in New Jersey, and even among the national media it seemed like a bit of fresh air: a politician willing to say what he really meant even if it wasn’t entirely PC. But governor of New Jersey is one thing. President of the United States is another. If this had been 2016 and Christie had pulled Saturday’s stunt during a primary run, that NBC footage would be blanketing cable news on a 24/7 loop. If he did it a second time, his presidential aspirations would be over. Something that seems sort of cute when it’s just Jersey—and when it’s something you vaguely hear about third hand—would sink you if you were running for president. I guarantee you that the American public will very quickly become repelled at the sight of a Jersey loudmouth bullying ordinary citizens who have the temerity to disagree with him. So the question is, can Christie control himself? Or will he lose his temper one too many times during a grueling, sleepless primary campaign? Since “one too many times” is quite possibly “once,” my money says he doesn’t stand much of a chance. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "<a  Update, Tuesday, October 29, 2013: The House will vote on this bill tomorrow. On Friday, the New York Times reported on the front page that Citigroup drafted most of a House bill that would allow banks to engage in risky trades backed by a potential taxpayer-funded bailout. The Times notes that “Citigroup’s recommendations were reflected in more than 70 lines of the House committee’s 85-line bill.” Special-interest lobbyists often play a role in writing legislation on the Hill, but such sausage-making is rarely revealed to the public. In this instance, members of Congress and a band of lobbyists have been caught red-handed, and Mother Jones has obtained the Citigroup draft that is practically identical to the House bill. As you can see in the side-by-side comparison below, the lobbyists for Citigroup really earned their pay on this job. The bill, called the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act, was approved by the House financial services committee in May and is headed for a vote on the House floor soon. It would gut a section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act called the “push-out rule.” Banks hate the push-out rule, which is scheduled to go into effect on July 13, because this provision will forbid them from trading certain derivatives (which are complicated financial instruments with values derived from underlying variables, such as crop prices or interest rates). Under this rule, banks will have to move these risky trades into separate non-bank affiliates that aren’t insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are less likely to receive government bailouts. The bill would smother the push-out rule in its crib by permitting banks to use government-insured deposits to bet on a wider range of these risky derivatives. Here is the key section of the legislation that Citigroup cooked up compared to the same section of the final bill: The bill is sponsored by Republican and Democratic members—Randy Hultgren (R-Ill.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.), Richard Hudson (R-NC), and Sean Patrick Mahoney (D-NY)—and its passage would be great news for Citi and other financial titans. Five banks—Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo—control more than 90 percent of the $700 trillion derivatives market. “The big banks support [the bill] because it means that they’ll get to keep the public subsidy”—FDIC insurance and the implicit promise of a taxpayer bailout—”to their derivatives-dealing business,” explains Marcus Stanley, the policy director at Americans for Financial Reform. The origins of the Citigroup proposal date back to 2011, when several large banks fought to repeal the push-out rule entirely. When it became clear that full repeal couldn’t pass, Citigroup pitched an alternative: allow banks to use FDIC-insured money to bet on almost anything they wanted. It proposed letting banks keep most types of derivatives trading in-house, requiring only that derivatives based on certain pools of assets, such as mortgages, be moved into separate entities. Citigroup was not able to get the measure passed before the end of the last Congress, but its allies on Capitol Hill reintroduced it this year. Citi’s move to expand the types of derivatives it can trade comes as banks have increasingly been shifting derivatives out of their investment banking divisions (which aren’t backed by FDIC insurance) and into taxpayer-backed entities. “The rule is needed more than ever,” says Mike Konczal, an expert on financial reform at the Roosevelt Institute. The financial services committee passed the Citi-written bill on a 53-to-6 vote; all the no votes came from Democrats. This is certainly not the first time that the financial industry has shaped financial reform laws for Congress. Citigroup was a central player in the 1999 repeal of the Depression-era law called the Glass-Steagall Act that forced banks not to engage in investment activities. Its lobbyists flooded Capitol Hill for that fight. “Citigroup was of course the bank that administered the coup de grace to Glass-Steagall,” says Stanley. Citigroup’s drafting of the anti-push-out measure fits into “a long history of things being written by industry—and that generally has not worked out very well,” says Konczal. “This is very bad news.” See how the Citigroup proposal allows more risky dealings by taxpayer-backed banks: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) does not like Obamacare.David Peterson/Mct/ZUMAPress Scott Messick is a 54-year-old retired health insurance consultant from Conroe, Texas. His wife runs a small yarn shop. They’re both on his former employer’s health insurance plan for retirees, and Messick says that he and his wife together pay $964 a month in premiums, and a $12,000 annual deductible (the amount of money they have to pay out-of-pocket each year before the insurer will pay any expenses). Starting in January, their premiums will shoot up to $1,283 a month, he says. Earlier this month, Messick logged on to the federal insurance exchange website to shop for a new plan. (The federal government’s health insurance website has so many problems that many Americans are not able to register for the site, let alone compare plans. But Messick got through.) Although the Messicks’ income is too high to qualify for a subsidy, they found a plan that would save them $6,000 a year in premium payments, and another $5,000 or so on their deductible. Despite the fact that Obamacare could cut their health care costs almost in half, the Messicks might not switch plans. Why? Because Republicans might repeal the law. “My wife is concerned that Republicans will try to get rid of this thing, and if they do, we’ve jumped out of a retiree plan,” Messick says. “We’d be left with nothing.” Many retiree health plans stipulate that you can only enroll in the plan once, and if you drop coverage—say, by buying cheaper insurance on the exchange—you’re out for good. “The door swings one way,” Messick explains. That one-way door could be a problem for many Americans if Obamacare is repealed, says Tim Jost, a health care law scholar at Washington and Lee University School of Law who has consulted with the administration on the implementation of the law. If people like the Messicks buy cheaper insurance on the exchange and Republicans gut the Affordable Care Act, insurance industry prices and practices could return to what they were pre-Obamacare. That means insurers could go back to rejecting older folks, who tend to have chronic health problems, or charging them astronomical prices. Messick has chronic back problems; his wife has suffered a minor stroke and has migraines. “Both my wife and I are uninsurable” in the private market, Messick says, adding that a few years ago he ran an “experiment” and tried to purchase insurance outside of his employer plan and was “turned down flat.” “Before somebody opts out of retiree coverage of any form—if they can’t opt back in…they need to think about that pretty carefully,” Jost says. “It’s unfortunate that people are worried [repeal] is going to happen,” and are denying themselves the benefits of the law, says Tony Carrk, a health care expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. “It’s cheaper coverage. [Messick] should take it!” Carrk adds. But if the Messicks decide that Republicans can’t be trusted to keep Obamacare intact, and end up sticking with their original retirement plan, not only will they pay up to $11,000 more each year for insurance, they’ll also have worse quality coverage. Under Obamacare, retiree-only plans offered by employers are exempt from many of the protections and benefits that plans purchased on the exchange provide. Insurers that offer retiree plans similar to the Messicks’, for example, can still cap the total dollar amount of benefits they will pay per year, and over a lifetime. (Plans purchased on the exchange forbid those limits.) Nor are plans like the Messicks’ subject to an external rate review to determine if the prices the insurer is charging are fair. It’s not just retirees who may have to factor an eventual repeal into their health insurance decision making. Anyone who purchases an insurance plan on the state or federal exchange and qualifies for a premium tax credit could be left in the lurch if the GOP guts Obama’s health law. A consumer may drop her current insurance for an better quality exchange plan that she can afford with a federal subsidy. But if the law is repealed, she’ll lose the subsidy and may not be able to afford the plan anymore, Jost says. If we return to pre-Obamacare America, she may not be able to return to her original plan if she has developed a preexisting condition…or if she is simply older and more of a risk to insurers. (Jost thinks that if the GOP did succeed in repealing the law, Republicans would likely soften the blow by passing a law forbidding insurers from rejecting applicants due to preexisting conditions.) House Republicans have now voted 42 times to repeal Obamacare, and have tried to chip away at the health care law through lawsuits, delays, and funding cuts. Those attempts are futile while President Barack Obama remains in office, but conservatives are optimistic about 2017, when they hope Republicans will have gained full control of Congress and the White House. Obamacare backers are convinced that even then, repeal will never happen, because the law will be up and running and no one—Democrats or Republican—will want to give up their affordable health care. “The likelihood of repeal is as likely as the sun not setting or rising,” vows Obamacare cheerleader Ethan Rome, who is executive director of Healthcare for America Now, a nonprofit that backs the law. We’ll see about that. For now, the Messicks aren’t taking any chances. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "The explosion of college tuition and student debt is leaving more grads with big bills and doubts about their futures. Some back-to-school stats: The good news: College grads earn 84% more than high school grads. The bad: Getting that sheepskin is getting a lot more expensive. Between 2000 and 2012: • Consumer Price Index increased 33%. • Median household income (adjusted for inflation) dropped 9%. • Average four-year college tuition increased 44%. • Private for-profit tuition increased 19%. • Private nonprofit college tuition increased 36%. • Public college tuition increased 71%. Between 2000 and 2012: • Public spending on public education has dropped 30% even as enrollment at public colleges has jumped 34%. As college costs have shot up, so has student debt. Americans owe almost $1 trillion on their student loans, 310% more than a decade ago. In 1989, 9% of households had student debt. Today nearly 20% do. The average amount of student loan debt has increased 177% since 1989. Debt is increasing fastest for those who have the least money to pay it back. 56% of all student loan debt is owed by households headed by people 35 or older. 47% of total student loan debt is held by households with incomes below $60,000. Nearly half of college graduates with student debt say it has made it more difficult for them to make ends meet. 24% say it has affected their career choices. 25% of recent grads say student loan debt has made them take unexciting jobs just for the money. Student debt’s impact on borrowers’ long-term plans: • For every $10,000 in student debt: Borrowers’ likelihood of taking a nonprofit, government, or education job drops more than 5 percentage points. Their long-term probability of getting married drops at least 7 percentage points. • Student loans affect the housing market: Larger student debt burdens are making it harder for recent college graduates to get home loans, according to the National Association of Home Builders. • Student loans affect the entire economy: The Financial Stability Oversight Council reports that high student debt levels could “lead to dampened consumption,” and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warns that unpaid student loans “could be a drag on the recovery.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Coal miners at a 2016 Trump Rally in West VirginiaAP/Steve Helber This story first appeared at TomDispatch.com. In a year of record-setting heat on a blistered globe, with fast-warming oceans, fast-melting ice caps, and fast-rising sea levels, ratification of the December 2015 Paris climate summit agreement—already endorsed by most nations—should be a complete no-brainer. That it isn’t tells you a great deal about our world. Global geopolitics and the possible rightward lurch of many countries (including a potential deal-breaking election in the United States that could put a climate denier in the White House) spell bad news for the fate of the Earth. It’s worth exploring how this might come to be. The delegates to that 2015 climate summit were in general accord about the science of climate change and the need to cap global warming at 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius (or 2.6 to 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit) before a planetary catastrophe ensues. They disagreed, however, about much else. Some key countries were in outright conflict with other states (Russia with Ukraine, for example) or deeply hostile to each other (as with India and Pakistan or the United States and Iran). In recognition of such tensions and schisms, the assembled countries crafted a final document that replaced legally binding commitments with the obligation of each signatory state to adopt its own unique plan, or “nationally determined contribution,” for curbing climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the fate of the planet rests on the questionable willingness of each of those countries to abide by that obligation, however sour or bellicose its relations with other signatories may be. As it happens, that part of the agreement has already been buffeted by geopolitical headwinds and is likely to face increasing turbulence in the years to come. That geopolitics will play a decisive role in determining the success or failure of the Paris Agreement has become self-evident in the short time since its promulgation. While some progress has been made toward its formal adoption—the agreement will enter into force only after no fewer than 55 countries, accounting for at least 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, have ratified it—it has also encountered unexpected political hurdles, signaling trouble to come. On the bright side, in a stunning diplomatic coup, President Barack Obama persuaded Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign the accord with him during a recent meeting of the G-20 group of leading economies in Hangzhou. Together, the two countries are responsible for a striking 40 percent of global emissions. “Despite our differences on other issues,” Obama noted during the signing ceremony, “we hope our willingness to work together on this issue will inspire further ambition and further action around the world.” Brazil, the planet’s seventh-largest emitter, just signed on as well, and a number of states, including Japan and New Zealand, have announced their intention to ratify the agreement soon. Many others are expected to do so before the next major UN climate summit in Marrakesh, Morocco, this November. On the dark side, however, Great Britain’s astonishing Brexit vote has complicated the task of ensuring the European Union’s approval of the agreement, as European solidarity on the climate issue—a major factor in the success of the Paris negotiations—can no longer be assured. “There is a risk that this could kick EU ratification of the Paris Agreement into the long grass,” suggests Jonathan Grant, director of sustainability at PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Brexit campaign itself was spearheaded by politicians who were also major critics of climate science and strong opponents of efforts to promote a transition from carbon-based fuels to green sources of energy. For example, the chair of the Vote Leave campaign, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, is also chairman of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank devoted to sabotaging government efforts to speed the transition to green energy. Many other top Leave campaigners, including former Conservative ministers John Redwood and Owen Paterson, were also vigorous climate deniers. In explaining the strong link between these two camps, analysts at the Economist noted that both oppose British submission to international laws and norms: “Brexiteers dislike EU regulations and know that any effective action to tackle climate change will require some kind of global cooperation: carbon taxes or binding targets on emissions. The latter would be the EU writ large and Britain would have even less say in any global agreement, involving some 200 nations, than in an EU regime involving 28.” Keep in mind as well that Angela Merkel and François Hollande, the leaders of the other two anchors of the European Union, Germany and France, are both embattled by right-wing anti-immigrant parties likely to be similarly unfriendly to such an agreement. And in what could be the deal-breaker of history, this same strain of thought, combining unbridled nationalism, climate denialism, fierce hostility to immigration, and unwavering support for domestic fossil fuel production, also animates Donald Trump’s campaign for the American presidency. In his first major speech on energy, delivered in May, Trump—who has called global warming a Chinese hoax—pledged to “cancel the Paris climate agreement” and scrap the various measures announced by President Obama to ensure US compliance with its provisions. Echoing the views of his Brexit counterparts, he complained that “this agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use on our land, in our country. No way.” He also vowed to revive construction of the Keystone XL pipeline (which would bring carbon-heavy Canadian tar sands oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast), to reverse any climate-friendly Obama administration acts, and to promote the coal industry. “Regulations that shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants and block the construction of new ones—how stupid is that?” he said, mockingly. In Europe, ultranationalist parties on the right are riding a wave of Islamophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and disgust with the European Union. In France, for instance, former President Nicolas Sarkozy announced his intention to run for that post again, promising even more stringent controls on migrants and Muslims and a greater focus on French “identity.” Even further to the right, the rabidly anti-Muslim Marine Le Pen is also in the race at the head of her National Front Party. Like-minded candidates have already made gains in national elections in Austria and most recently in a state election in Germany that stunned Merkel’s ruling party. In each case, they surged by disavowing relatively timid efforts by the European Union to resettle refugees from Syria and other war-torn countries. Although climate change is not a defining issue in these contests as it is in the United States and Britain, the growing opposition to anything associated with the European Union and its regulatory system poses an obvious threat to future continent-wide efforts to cap greenhouse gas emissions. Elsewhere in the world, similar strands of thinking are spreading, raising serious questions about the ability of governments to ratify the Paris Agreement or, more importantly, to implement its provisions. Take India, for example. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has voiced support for the Paris accord and promised a vast expansion of solar power. He has also made no secret of his determination to promote economic growth at any cost, including greatly increased reliance on coal-powered electricity. That spells trouble. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), India is likely to double its coal consumption over the next 25 years, making it the world’s second-largest coal consumer after China. Combined with an increase in oil and natural gas consumption, such a surge in coal use could result in a tripling of India’s carbon dioxide emissions at a time when most countries (including the United States and China) are expected to experience a peak or decline in theirs. Prime Minister Modi is well aware that his devotion to coal has generated resentment among environmentalists in India and elsewhere who seek to slow the growth of carbon emissions. He nonetheless insists that, as a major developing nation, India should enjoy a special right to achieve economic growth in any way it can, even if this means endangering the environment. “The desire to improve one’s lot has been the primary driving force behind human progress,” his government affirmed in its emissions-reduction pledge to the Paris climate summit. “Nations that are now striving to fulfill this ‘right to grow’ of their teeming millions cannot be made to feel guilty [about] their development agenda as they attempt to fulfill this legitimate aspiration.” Russia is similarly likely to put domestic economic needs (and the desire to remain a great power, militarily and otherwise) ahead of its global climate obligations. Although President Vladimir Putin attended the Paris summit and assured the gathered nations of Russian compliance with its outcome, he has also made it crystal clear that his country has no intention of giving up its reliance on oil and natural gas exports for a large share of its national income. According to the EIA, Russia’s government relies on such exports for a staggering 50 percent of its operating revenue, a share it dare not jeopardize at a time when its economy—already buffeted by EU and US sanctions—is in deep recession. To ensure the continued flow of hydrocarbon income, in fact, Moscow has announced multibillion-dollar plans to develop new oil and gas fields in Siberia and the Arctic, even if such efforts fly in the face of commitments to reduce future carbon emissions. Such nationalistic exceptionalism could become something of the norm if Donald Trump wins in November, or other nations join those already eager to put the needs of a fossil-fuel-based domestic growth agenda ahead of global climate commitments. With that in mind, consider the assessment of future energy trends that the Norwegian energy giant Statoil recently produced. In it is a chilling scenario focused on just this sort of dystopian future. The second-biggest producer of natural gas in Europe after Russia’s Gazprom, Statoil annually issues “Energy Perspectives,” a report that explores possible future energy trends. Previous editions included scenarios labeled “reform” (predicated on coordinated but gradual international efforts to shift from carbon fuels to green energy technology) and “renewal” (positing a more rapid transition). The 2016 edition, however, added a grim new twist: “rivalry.” It depicts a realistically downbeat future in which international strife and geopolitical competition discourage significant cooperation in the climate field. According to the document, the new section is “driven” by real-world developments—by, that is, “a series of political crises, growing protectionism, and a general fragmentation of the state system, resulting in a multipolar world developing in different directions. In this scenario, there is growing disagreement about the rules of the game and a decreasing ability to manage crises in the political, economic, and environmental arenas.” In such a future, Statoil suggests, the major powers would prove to be far more concerned with satisfying their own economic and energy requirements than pursuing collaborative efforts aimed at slowing the pace of climate change. For many of them, this would mean maximizing the cheapest and most accessible fuel options available—often domestic supplies of fossil fuels. Under such circumstances, the report suggests, the use of coal would rise, not fall, and its share of global energy consumption would actually increase from 29 percent to 32 percent. In such a world, forget about those “nationally determined contributions” agreed to in Paris and think instead about a planet whose environment will grow ever less friendly to life as we know it. In its rivalry scenario, writes Statoil, “the climate issue has low priority on the regulatory agenda. While local pollution issues are attended to, large-scale international climate agreements are not the chosen way forward. As a consequence, the current NDCs are only partly implemented. Climate finance ambitions are not met, and carbon pricing to stimulate cost-efficient reductions in countries and across national borders are limited.” Coming from a major fossil fuel company, this vision of how events might play out on an increasingly tumultuous planet makes for peculiar reading: more akin to Eaarth—Bill McKibben’s dystopian portrait of a climate-ravaged world—than the usual industry-generated visions of future world health and prosperity. And while “rivalry” is only one of several scenarios Statoil’s authors considered, they clearly found it unnervingly convincing. Hence, in a briefing on the report, the company’s chief economist, Eirik Wærness, indicated that Great Britain’s looming exit from the European Union was exactly the sort of event that would fit the proposed model and might multiply in the future. Indeed, the future pace of climate change will be determined as much by geopolitical factors as technological developments in the energy sector. While it is evident that immense progress is being made in bringing down the price of wind and solar power in particular—far more so than all but a few analysts anticipated until recently—the political will to turn such developments into meaningful global change and so bring carbon emissions to heel before the planet is unalterably transformed may, as the Statoil authors suggest, be dematerializing before our eyes. If so, make no mistake about it: We will be condemning Earth’s future inhabitants, our own children and grandchildren, to unmitigated disaster. As Obama’s largely unheralded success in Hangzhou indicates, such a fate is not etched in stone. If he could persuade the fiercely nationalistic leader of a country worried about its economic future to join him in signing the climate agreement, more such successes are possible. His ability to achieve such outcomes is, however, diminishing by the week, and few other leaders of his stature and determination appear to be waiting in the wings. To avoid an Eaarth (as both Bill McKibben and the Statoil authors imagine it) and preserve the welcoming planet in which humanity grew and thrived, climate activists will have to devote at least as much of their energy and attention to the international political arena as to the technology sector. At this point, electing green-minded leaders, stopping climate deniers (or ignorers) from capturing high office, and opposing fossil-fueled ultranationalism is the only realistic path to a habitable planet.

        "articles": "Republican State Sen. Ron Gould is running for Congress in Arizona’s 4th congressional district. It’s a heavily Democratic district, so he’s probably not going to win. But Gould’s not going down quietly. He has released an ad (below) in which he blasts a hole through Obamacare with a pump-action shotgun. “It’s rather ridiculous that somehow now guns are off limits because we had a congresswoman shot in Arizona,” he told Fox 10 Phoenix. Firing a gun in a political ad is hardly a new idea. And it’s not the exclusive domain of Republicans. Here’s a quick guide to how it’s done: Shooter: Arizona congressional candidate Ron Gould (R). Year: 2012. Weapon: pump-action shotgun. Target: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare). Scale of Destruction: Mixed—Gould uses what looks to be a slimmed-down version of the law. Shooter: Oklahoma congressional candidate Rob Wallace (D). Year: 2012 Weapon: pump shotgun; scoped thirty-ought-six hunting rifle. Target: The state of Texas. Scale of destruction: Absolute. Shooter: West Virginia Senate candidate Joe Manchin (D). Year: 2010 Weapon: scoped single-shot bolt-action hunting rifle. Target: “The cap-and-trade bill.” Scale of Destruction: Does it really count if the bill was already dead? Candidate: Alabama Agriculture Commission candidate Dale Peterson (R). Year: 2010. Weapon: .30-caliber lever-action Winchester. Target: A supporter of his opponent. Scale of Destruction: None; Dale Peterson is, at heart, a man of peace. Candidate: Colorado congressional candidate Bob McConnell (R). Year: 2010. Weapon: automatic pistol; heavily modified AR-15 assault carbine. Target: Osama bin Laden. Scale of destruction: Destroyed. Candidate: Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer (D). Year: 2008. Weapon: over-and-under double-barreled shotgun. Target: The federal Real ID law. Scale of Distruction: Absolute. Honorable mentions go to Wyoming state Sen. Gerald Gay (R)—who has taken down* the videos of him blowing up “socialism,” the Affordable Care Act, the US Capitol, and cap-and-trade with a semi-automatic AR-15 (among other tools)—and Arizona congressional candidate Pamela Gorma (R). Per YouTube, embedding of Gorma’s 2010 campaign ad has been “disabled by request.” Given that Gorma’s ad basically consists of her firing a machine gun for 45 seconds, we’re inclined to honor that request. Update: Gay’s demolition of the Capitol is still viewable on Facebook. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "<a  Voters in the birthplace of mass incarceration just gave it a major blow. With California’s passage of Proposition 47, which reclassifies nonviolent crimes previously considered felonies—think simple drug possession or petty theft—as misdemeanors, some 40,000 fewer people will be convicted of felonies each year. Thousands of prisoners could be set free. People with certain kinds of felonies on their records can now apply to have them removed. The state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates the reforms will save California hundreds of millions of dollars annually, money that will be reinvested in school truancy and dropout prevention, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and victim services. The proposition’s passage represents a pendulum swing: Just two decades ago, California overwhelmingly passed a three-strikes ballot initiative that would go on to send people to prison for life for stealing tube socks and other minor offenses. Last night, the state’s voters turned back the dial. The new law requires the savings from reducing prison rolls to be reinvested into other areas that could, in the long-term, further reduce the prison population. Take dropout prevention: Half of the nation’s dropouts are jobless, and according to a 2006 study by the Gates Foundation, and they are more than eight times as likely to get locked up. The same goes for increased funding to aid the mentally ill. In California, the number of mentally ill prisoners has doubled over the last 14 years. Mentally ill inmates in state prisons serve an average of 15 months longer. Lockups have become our country’s go-to provider of mental health care: the nation’s three largest mental health providers are jails. There are ten times as many mentally ill people behind bars as in state hospitals. Sixteen percent of inmates have a severe mental illness like schizophrenia, which is two and a half times the rate in the early 1980s. Prop 47 will provide more money for mental health programs that have been proven to drop incarceration rates. For example, when Nevada County, California started an Assisted Outpatient Treatment program, average jail times for the mentally ill dropped from 521 days to just 17. Keeping drug users out of prison and putting more money into drug treatment is probably the most commonsense change that will come out of the measure. Sixteen percent of state prisoners and half of federal prisoners are incarcerated for drug offenses. Yet there is growing evidence that incarceration does not reduce drug addiction. And while 65 percent of US inmates are drug addicts, only 11 percent receive treatment in prison. Alternatives exist: a pilot project in Hawaii suggested that drug offenders given probation over being sent to prison were half as likely to be arrested for a new crime and 70 percent less likely to use drugs. California’s vote comes at a time when it seems more and more Americans are questioning how often—and for how long—our justice system incarcerates criminals. Last year, a poll of, yes, Texas Republicans showed that 81% favored treatment over prison for drug offenders. The passage of Prop 47 is yet another example that prison reform is no longer a partisan issue. The largest single backer of the ballot measure was Bradley Wayne Hughes Jr., a conservative multimillionaire who has been a major financial supporter of Republicans and Karl Rove’s American Crossroads. His donation of $1.3 million was second only to contributions from George Soros’s Open Society Policy Center. The passage of Prop 47 might inspire campaigners to put prison on the ballot in other states. It might also push lawmakers to realize they can ease the penal code on their own without voters skewering them for letting nonviolent people out of prison—and keeping them out.

        "articles": "Inevitable Republican nominee Mitt Romney<a  Skidmore</a>/Flickr On April 24, the night Mitt Romney triumphed in five primary contests and essentially clinched the Republican presidential nomination, the former Massachusetts governor delivered his victory speech in Manchester, the largest city in the swing state of New Hampshire. This address, CNN noted, marked Romney’s “pivot to the general election campaign.” WMUR, the ABC affiliate in New Hampshire, declared, “Romney Delivers Rousing Speech in Manchester.” Fox Nation dubbed the address, “Romney’s Killer Speech.” The New York Times reported that Romney “laid out a succinct argument for his economic leadership.” There was not much media analysis of the substance of the speech—especially Romney’s chief argument that he and Obama “have very different visions” of the United States. The core of Romney’s case for himself was this: Government is at the center of [Obama’s] vision. It dispenses the benefits, borrows what it cannot take, and consumes a greater and greater share of the economy. With Obamacare fully installed, government will come to control half the economy, and we will have effectively ceased to be a free enterprise society. More Romney stories: With government controlling 50 percent of the entire economy, Romney said, “our lives will be ruled by bureaucrats and boards, commissions, and czars.” But is it true that once Obamacare fully kicks in, government will have complete dominion over half the economy? Or might this be one of the biggest fibs of Romney’s campaign? I asked Romney HQ for an explanation, and it graciously replied with this: In 2010, government expenditures as % of GDP were 38.13%. By 2020, with Obamacare in place, the government estimates that health care spending as a % of GDP will climb 1.84 points. This would bring government expenditures as % of GDP to 39.97%. In addition, private health care expenditures will be 10.03% of GDP in 2020. If we count that as under federal control, we get to 50.00% of GDP. I ran this justification by several economists who are consulted on such matters by media fact-checkers, and—to various degrees—they took exception. There is, it seems, much wrong with Romney’s statement and the analysis upon which it rests. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute (who says he doesn’t fancy being drawn into dust-ups regarding statements from presidential candidates), notes that the Romney camp is adopting an unfair baseline. It’s starting point is 2010, when, due to the recession, the US government was spending more (food stamps, unemployment benefits, other forms of assistance, and the stimulus) and the economy was lackluster. Consequently, government expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product were higher than normal. Steuerle points out that it is wrong to assume this level will remain, and he notes that when “recessionary spending” ends, the overall government expenditures-to-GDP ratio is likely to drop. This sort of statistics fudging is routine spin for a political campaign. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, explains that there are more fundamental problems with Romney’s analysis. Romney claims that all private health care expenditures—such as those that occur when a Medicare beneficiary pays for a service not covered by the program or when a person with insurance at work obtains medical services—should be counted in the government-controlled category. This is “ludicrous,” Burtless says. Romney is assuming that under Obamacare, these health care transactions will be controlled by government, apparently accepting the premise that Obama’s initiative is a total government takeover of the health care sector (a much-repeated conservative trope that PolitiFact.com declared the “lie of the year” in 2010). But, Burtless points out, private health care expenditures have long been subject to government regulations, and Obama’s health care law does not “materially change the control of the health care sector that is considered private.” He adds, “You can’t move private dollars to ‘government control’ just because of health care reform. You can’t just reclassify these private dollars under government control. The private dollars my mother spends outside Medicare are no more under government control now than when this was done in the Reagan years.” To recap: Romney rigs the baseline by predicating his analysis on that 38 percent government-expenditures/GDP figure. Then he adds 10 percent for private health care expenditures in a manner that Burtless calls “ridiculous.” There’s more. Burtless contends that it is problematic to term making a transfer payment—for example, sending someone a Social Security check—an act of government control. “The government only has control in the sense that it is raising the money—or borrowing it—and sending it out to the recipients,” he explains. “But it doesn’t control how these people spend the money.” His mother, he notes, receives Social Security, “and she can spend it any way she wants. She can give it to the Romney campaign.” With Medicare, she can select her own doctor; the government doesn’t control her choice. “The government does control the Defense Department,” Burtless notes. “It pays soldiers and general, pays for the supplies, tells the soldiers where they will be stationed. But when it gives me a transfer payment, does it really control the economy?” Given that there are federal laws regarding property, patents, interstate commerce, trading aboard (such as the prohibition on trading in Cuba), and other economic activity, he adds, “you could say government controls 100 percent of the economy.” Bruce Bartlett, who served as a senior economist in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, was more blunt in his appraisal of Romney’s assertion that Obamacare will lead to government control of half of the economy: “This analysis is so stupid it is hard to know where to begin.” He notes: Health spending has been rising for years for reasons unconnected to Obamacare. Why assume that all of any projected increase between now and 2020 results solely from that? Tossing in all private health spending as essentially part of government spending is fundamentally dishonest. Its only purpose appears to be to find some desperate way of lifting total spending above the 50 percent threshold. If you are going to do that, why not include every other sector of the economy subject to government control? If Romney equates government involvement in an economic sector with control, Bartlett notes, then there’s no limit to the nightmare Romney is promoting. “Agriculture is heavily controlled, so why don’t we add all food consumption to government’s share of GDP?” Bartlett asks. “Banking is also heavily controlled, so let’s add that too. Ditto housing, manufacturing, etc. This doesn’t pass the laugh test.” Yet no one is howling foul about Romney relying on this scary-sounding factoid to promote his claim that Obama is on the verge of destroying free enterprise in the United States. (PolitiFact has previously called out Romney for saying the United States is “inches away from no longer being a free economy.”) On the campaign trail, Romney touts his corporate credentials and argues he knows what’s best for the ailing US economy. That’s certainly fair play. But he has continuously accused Obama of not understanding the nation or its economy (while apologizing for the country overseas) and of desiring to turn the United States into an European-style state where poverty will spread. To level such an indictment credibly, it helps to toss out facts—or what seem to be facts. By charging Obama with a power grab that will place government in control of half of the economy, Romney positions himself as a savior for those voters who believe (maybe because of Romney’s own demagoguery) that Obama is running amok and threatening the fundamental nature of the nation. This claim was a supersize stretch of the truth. Yet nothing prevented Romney from making good use of it, for in this political culture there is often little, if any, penalty to be paid for hurling such reality-defying rhetoric. One can only wonder how big the whoppers will get by November. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Illustration: Steve Brodner Its birth certificate says that the tea party was born one month after Barack Obama’s inauguration, on the day that CNBC’s Rick Santelli delivered a blistering on-air tirade against Obama’s mortgage bailout plan. But that’s only the official story. In reality, we’ve seen the tea party before. When FDR was president, it was called the American Liberty League. When JFK was president, it was the John Birch Society. When Bill Clinton was president, it was the Vince Foster conspiracy theorists. America’s far right fluoresces like this whenever a Democrat is in the White House, and Obama’s first term was no exception. But the tea party burned bright and fell fast. Sure, it galvanized opposition to Obama in a media-friendly kind of way, and helped power the Republican Party to a big majority in the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterms. But given the state of the economy this was a victory they probably would have won anyway. And on the other side of the Capitol building, the tea party was almost certainly responsible for the loss of three winnable Senate seats that year. By 2012, after tea party forces nominated several more “wackadoodles” (in Republican strategist Steve Schmidt’s phrasing) and helped the GOP lose two more winnable Senate seats, its name was officially mud. But none of that matters. The tea party has done its job, and for all practical purposes its hard-nosed, no-compromise ideology now controls the Republican Party in a way that neither the Birchers nor the Clinton conspiracy theorists ever did. It’s no longer a wing of the Republican Party, it is the Republican Party. So what’s next? Having now lost two presidential elections in a row, conventional wisdom says Republicans have two choices. The first is to admit that tea partyism has failed. 2012 was its best chance for victory, and evolving demographics will only make hardcore conservatism less and less popular. As South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has put it, “We’re not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.” So the party will need to moderate or die. The second option is to double down. Party activists will tell themselves that Mitt Romney was never a true conservative, and that’s what voters sensed. But Republicans can win again in 2016 if they stay true to their principles, moving farther right and amping up the obstruction of all things Obama even more. In Congress, Paul Ryan will be their pied piper and Eric Cantor will be their enforcer. To most liberals, it seems obvious that if the GOP’s leaders are smart, they’ll choose the first option. But the truth is that this isn’t as obvious as we’d like to believe. After all, moving to the right has worked out pretty well for the party. In 1980, the Reagan revolution gave them control of the Senate for the first time in decades. In 1994, the Gingrich revolution gave them control of the House. In 1998 they impeached Bill Clinton, and two years later won the presidency. In 2009 the tea party took over, and in 2010 they won a landslide midterm victory. The truth is that an ever more radicalized GOP seems to have done at least as well as a more normal GOP probably would have done. Maybe better. So for now, at least, it seems probable that we’re stuck with Option 2. Republican Party elders will probably try to be a little more careful about vetting candidates for political Tourette syndrome (no more “legitimate rape,” please), but otherwise the tea party strain will remain ascendant even if the name itself is relegated to the ash heap of history. Republicans will continue to deny climate change, continue to insist that tax cuts pay for themselves, and continue to believe that Barack Obama is a socialist revolutionary. They will once again hold America’s economy hostage over the debt ceiling and tax cuts for the rich, and they will continue to filibuster every single bill that Democrats introduce in the Senate. That much is, frankly, so predictable as to be uninteresting. What is interesting is this: Why doesn’t the American electorate punish this behavior? After all, polls don’t suggest that the public has moved much to the right over the past few decades, and yet it continues to give an ever more right-wing Republican Party about 50 percent of the vote. What’s going on? At this point we enter the realm of guesswork. One guess is that the public treats unhinged behavior from Republicans these days as merely a kind of brand marker, not something to be taken seriously. Based on past experience, they figure that once Republicans are actually in office they’ll talk crazy but mostly act like a fairly normal conservative party. For liberals, a more unnerving guess is that we simply haven’t made ourselves into a consistently appealing alternative for persuadable centrists. We’re too eager to raise taxes. We display too much public contempt for things like religion and gun ownership. We don’t offer the middle class enough in the way of concrete benefits, and when we do (as with Obamacare) we sell it so poorly that people barely even realize what they’re getting. If either—or both—of these things are true, it’s easy to see why Republican extremism hasn’t hurt them very much. The next few years, however, could finally be different. If Republicans hold the American economy hostage over the debt ceiling again, their crazy talk might start to sound a little more worrisome. If voters start taking climate change more seriously in the wake of Sandy, concerned independents might abandon a denialist GOP. If the growth of the black and Hispanic electorate causes Republicans to double down on efforts to suppress the nonwhite vote, they could provoke a serious backlash. And if Obamacare gets implemented competently and Democrats make serious progress on reining in the deficit, centrists might not have much reason left to vote against them. In any case, there’s a simple message here for lefties: Don’t worry so much about Republicans. Worry about getting the public on our side. If we do that, the GOP will either back away from crazytown or else it will die a natural death. To borrow James Carville’s famous epigram, It’s Public Opinion, Stupid.

        "articles": "The day before Halloween, a band of 40 or so middle-aged Democratic activists gathered in the parking lot of a long-closed KFC in Eagan, a southern suburb of the Twin Cities, to listen to a handful of state party leaders speak. The party bigwigs, who were crisscrossing the state on a last-minute campaign tour, crowded a small, elevated stage in front of a bright blue bus bearing a logo proclaiming it was “On the Road to a Better Minnesota.” Sen. Al Franken’s daughter Thomasin told cute tales of her dad’s pride in becoming a grandfather. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman—tall, crisp-suited, with a stern jaw, he could have easily passed as an extra on House of Cards—delivered the same polished anecdotes about paddling northern Minnesota’s Boundary Waters with Franken that he told at every stop. Finally came the headliner: Gov. Mark Dayton. Engulfed in a puffy green jacket, his thinning gray hair combed over just so, Dayton stumbled through a disjointed speech. When the microphone briefly lost power, he cracked a lame joke: “This is actually secretly a DFL fundraiser, err, errr,” he said, using the initials for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, Minnesota’s homegrown Democratic outfit. “They’re so broke they can’t even afford electricity.” He got some pity laughter. Then he embarked on an extended metaphor comparing his governorship to his days as a hockey goalie in college. “A goalie can prevent bad things from happening. But he can’t—well, at least I could never score a goal,” Dayton said, sheepishness creeping into his voice. “A couple of the pros can shoot at an empty net, but that’s another story—yeah, you know, goalies can’t win games and they can’t make things happen that way.” For a man who has won a competitive US Senate race and secured his second term as governor in November, Mark Dayton is a terrible retail politician. “He’s very shy and he’s an introvert,” Ken Martin, the chair of the state party and a friend of Dayton’s, told me unprompted earlier this month. “He’s not a typical, backslapping politician,” Martin continued. “He’s not very articulate; he’s kind of jerky,” Tom Bakk, the Democratic Senate majority leader, says of his ally’s style. When Dayton first ran for his current job, in 2010, The New Republic dubbed him “Eeyore for Governor.” An heir to the Target retail fortune, Dayton, 68, has plowed tens of millions of his own money into his campaigns, but it still hasn’t come easy. He swallows his words in a rush, speaking in almost-unintelligible mumbles and frequently losing track of his point as he rambles on unrelated tangents. “He’s not a terribly articulate guy,” says Larry Jacobs, chair of the University of Minnesota’s public policy school. “He’s not a smooth talker; he struggles to give a smooth public speech.” At public events, Dayton hunches his shoulders, which makes him appear shorter than his 5-foot-10 frame, and often appears to be trying to disappear into the crowd. No one wonders whether he’ll seek national office someday. He’s not the leader of the free world—he’s your dad, struggling to make small talk with you and your friends after you get home from school. Think of Dayton as Scott Walker’s mirror image. With the help of GOP-controlled legislatures, Walker and other Republican governors, such as Kansas’ Sam Brownback, have passed wish lists of conservative policies and touted their states as laboratories that demonstrate the benefits of conservative governance. Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, has parlayed that hype into a potential 2016 presidential run. And across the border in Minnesota, Dayton seized a brief moment of unified Democratic control to create the liberal alternative to Walker’s Wisconsin—a blue-state laboratory for demonstrating the potential of liberal policies. Dayton didn’t “set out” with the objective of one-upping Walker in mind, he told me after the Eagan event. But “the contrast,” he notes, is obvious. Over the past several years, Minnesota has become a testing ground for a litany of policies Democrats hope to enact nationally: legalizing same-sex marriage, making it easier to vote, boosting primary education spending, instituting all-day kindergarten, expanding unionization, freezing college tuition, increasing the minimum wage, and passing new laws requiring equal pay for women. To pay for it all, Dayton pushed a sharp increase on taxes for the top 2 percent—one of the largest hikes in state history. Republicans went berserk, warning that businesses would flee the state and take jobs with them. The disaster Dayton’s GOP rivals predicted never happened. Two years after the tax hike, Minnesota’s economy is booming. The state added 172,000 jobs during Dayton’s first four years in office. Its 3.6 percent unemployment rate is among the lowest in the country (Wisconsin’s is 5.2 percent), and the Twin Cities have the lowest unemployment rate of any major metropolitan area. Under Dayton, Minnesota has consistently been in the top tier of states for GDP growth. Median incomes are $8,000 higher than the national average. In 2014, Minnesota led the nation in economic confidence, according to Gallup. Minnesota has even pulled ahead of Walker’s Wisconsin, leapfrogging its neighbor to the east on measure after measure. “In a whole number of ways, we’re very, very similar,” Bakk, the DFL Senate leader, says of the two states. “But politically, we have taken just totally different paths in the road.” Dayton cruised to a 5-point win in 2014, spending just $3 million in a race that received scant national attention. All Minnesota’s governor had to do was point to his policy successes. “We’ve confounded those who said if you’re going to raise taxes on the richest people they’re all going to leave the state, and all the businesses are going to leave the state and we’ll have this enormous drain on jobs. That hasn’t happened,” Dayton told me in October. “I feel affirmed in my political views,” he says now, “and that the direction we’ve taken in Minnesota is much better for our state and for most of the people in Minnesota than what’s happened in Wisconsin. The numbers show that unmistakably…I still think they’re the right politics for the Democratic Party—and the right policies for our country.” Before his time as governor, Dayton was largely seen as a lovable but aimless rich boy who had tried and failed to succeed in politics. In his 30s and 40s, Dayton spent millions of dollars of his own money losing two statewide campaigns—a Senate race and a gubernatorial primary. When he finally won a Senate seat, in 2000, he served a spectacularly unsuccessful single term before declining to run for reelection. “He’s a nice guy, but he’s a trustafarian,” says Stan Hubbard, a billionaire media mogul and prominent funder of GOP causes in Minnesota. Dayton’s money comes from his family. His great-grandfather George Dayton founded a department store named after the family in 1902. George Dayton’s heirs built the nation’s first fully enclosed mall in Edina in 1956. In 1962, the family branched out, opening the first Target in Roseville, Minnesota. A Dayton’s department store anchored most Minnesota malls until 2000, when the Dayton-Hudson Corporation became Target Corporation. The Target wealth—the family fortune is estimated at $1.4 billion—bankrolled Dayton’s runs for office. But that privileged upbringing also turned the millionaire heir into a devoted liberal—the sort of second-generation plutocrat who knows the inequality of the system firsthand and wants to tear it down. “To whom so much has been given, to him so much be required,” Dayton recalls as his father’s favorite Bible saying, and at first Dayton studied to be a doctor before engaging with ’60s politics in college. Dayton became a campus radical during college at Yale, and protested Honeywell’s role in making bombs for use in Vietnam even as his father sat on the company’s board. After he graduated in 1969, Dayton taught at a school on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and then transitioned to social work at Project Place, a South Boston-based organization that works with homeless young people. Dayton’s annual $30,000 donations covered a tenth of his employer’s budget. After four years in Boston, Dayton turned to politics, breaking from his Republican parents to fight for liberal causes. He worked as an aide in Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale’s office, then moved to Atlanta to work on Mondale’s vice presidential campaign. He was an original donor to Mother Jones in the 1970s. He even managed to earn a spot as the lone Minnesotan on Nixon’s so-called “enemies list”—a fact he would cite during his early political campaigns. In 1982, when he was 35, Dayton ran for Hubert Humphrey’s old Senate seat, then held by Republican David Durenberger. Dayton called his wealth his “original sin” and promised to close tax loopholes for corporations and the rich alike. The family business was the seventh-largest nonfood retailer in the country at that time, and Dayton sold off a large chunk of his shares to eventually throw $7 million of his own money into the campaign, which became one of the most expensive Senate races ever. But Durenberger tied his fortunes to the popular Ronald Reagan, attacked Dayton as a political novice unprepared for the job, and easily held on to his job. After the loss, Dayton struggled with alcoholism, but got sober—he checked into the Betty Ford clinic in 1987—and reined in his ambitions. In 1991, he ran a successful campaign for state auditor, serving an unremarkable four-year term. In 1998, he lost a gubernatorial primary to Humphrey’s son Skip, but he ran for statewide office again in 2000, forgoing “an expedition to the North Pole to make his second Senate run,” according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Dayton spent $12 million of his own money and was able to oust the incumbent, Republican Rod Grams. But Dayton picked a terrible time to join the Senate Democratic caucus. He spent just 18 months in the majority when he was still a junior senator with little sway. With Democrats otherwise in the minority, he couldn’t pass anything of consequence and grew visibly bored with the job. “The reality, he quickly learned, is that being 100th out of 100th in terms of seniority in the US Senate is not a good place to be,” state party chair Martin says. “It was just a lot harder for him to do the types of things he wanted to do.” At first, Dayton had Paul Wellstone, a fellow liberal Minnesotan, to offer guidance and keep him company in Washington. That changed after Wellstone died in a plane crash 11 days before the 2002 election. “It really soured him on Washington and changed his perspective quite a bit,” Martin says. “It became a lot more miserable for him being out there without Paul.” Dayton became one of just 23 senators to vote against the Iraq War, but his liberalism made it next to impossible to get anything done in the GOP-controlled Senate. Uninterested in the drudgery of legislative bickering, he came unmoored. He would later admit that he struggled with alcoholism and depression during the end of his tenure into the Senate. In 2006, Time declared Dayton one of the five worst senators in the country, and even he couldn’t really disagree, grading his term in office an F for job performance (he did, however, give himself an A for effort). “I found my role in the Senate extremely limited…Effectiveness in the Senate is majority and seniority, and I had had neither,” Dayton told me over the phone last week. He skipped running for reelection to spare himself the hassle of fundraising (he didn’t want to be the only person funding his campaign) and the embarrassment of a likely loss. “There will be plenty of Democrats who will say he had his chance, and he blew it,” political scientist Steven Smith decreed when Dayton left office in 2007. “They will make a credible argument that he will not make a great candidate. He came across in the eyes of many Minnesotans as a lightweight as US senator.” But Dayton wasn’t ready to give up on politics. “I wasn’t able to make much of a difference,” in the Senate, he says, “but I was still interested in trying to make a difference.” As his Senate term wrapped up, he began laying the groundwork for a gubernatorial run. Minnesota Democrats weren’t thrilled with the idea. In the summer of 2010, party officials voted to endorse Margaret Anderson Kelliher, the speaker of the state House of Representatives. But Dayton ignored that setback and went on to defeat the largely unknown Kelliher in the August primary. A Democrat hadn’t won the Minnesota governorship in over 20 years, and 2010 was an awful year for Democrats nationwide, as the GOP won a record number of governorships and state legislative seats. But Dayton, who ran on a soak-the-rich platform of massively hiking income taxes on the wealthiest people in the state, lucked into facing Tom Emmer, an opponent who was even more politically inept than he was, and Tom Horner, an ex-Republican turned third-party spoiler who peeled off 12 percent of the vote, mostly from moderate Republicans. Dayton won, limping into the governorship after a monthlong recount on the strength of an 8,800-vote margin. Dayton came into office as the state GOP was fighting the final battles of a civil war that had already pulled the party dramatically to the right. For decades, the Minnesota GOP—which until 1995 had called itself the Independent-Republican party—had worked with Democrats to invest in education, infrastructure, and job growth. That began to change in the 2000s, as religious conservatives like Michelle Bachmann displaced the Rockefeller Republicans of old. The state’s last budget surplus came in 1999, when then-Gov. Jesse Ventura returned the money to voters in the form of tax cuts and rebates rather than shoring up the state budget for a rainy day. When, inevitably, revenues later dipped, Republicans under Gov. Tim Pawlenty refused to raise taxes (especially as Pawlenty began to angle for the White House). The state constitution prohibits the government from borrowing money in almost all instances, so legislators pushed costs down to the school districts that could take out loans, with the hope that the state would one day pay them back. By the time Dayton was sworn in, on January 3, 2011, the recession and Pawlenty’s budget tomfoolery had left Minnesota with a $6.2 billion deficit for the next two years, and the state GOP, which had won control of both houses of the Legislature for the first time since the state ended nonpartisan elections in 1974, was in no mood to help. Immediately following the 2010 election, the state GOP excommunicated Republicans who had endorsed Horner, the independent, for governor—including Arne Carlson, who had been the Republican governor of the state for eight years in the 1990s. Tony Sutton, the state party chair, warned Republicans in the House and Senate that they too would be cast out if they dared to compromise with Dayton, let alone raise taxes. “It created this really nasty sort of dynamic within the Legislature where many of these Republicans felt like they were more allegiant to their party leader than to the people who voted them in,” says Ken Martin. Dayton was back where he had been in the US Senate—a lonely liberal who had made a lot of promises he couldn’t keep. When Dayton and GOP leaders couldn’t strike a deal, the state government, starved for funding, shut down. Dayton initially dug in his heels, vetoing nine budget bills in a row. “The Republicans’ all-cuts budget is extremely harsh and unfair to thousands of Minnesotans, and it’s not Minnesota,” Dayton said at the time. “The Republicans remain intransigent. They won’t budge $1 from the position they’ve held all through the session.” Democrats in the Legislature and outside activists felt confident that they held the upper hand as the shutdown dragged on. But three weeks into the crisis—by then the longest state government shutdown in US history—Dayton gathered party leaders in his office and surrendered. He agreed to the Republicans’ terms, and continued Pawlenty’s practice of filling budget holes with temporary borrowing chicanery. The budget gained few votes from DFL legislators, with the Democrats’ leader in the House damning it as “the most irresponsible budget in state history.” It was supposed to have been Dayton’s make-or-break moment—and it looked like he broke. “Many Democrats thought he gave up more than he should to get the state open again,” says Steven Schier, a political scientist at Carleton College. Dayton muddled through the rest of the first half of his term, vetoing what he could. “When those Republicans arrived here in January 2011,” Dayton says, “they had their mandate and they were ready to rock and roll. Everything was coming at me. I’m a hockey goalie—it felt like a warm up where everybody was hitting the pucks at the same time. But, you know, I used 57 vetoes, so that was my ultimate recourse, just to block most of what they were trying to accomplish.” Republicans found a workaround, bypassing Dayton’s veto to put two constitutional amendments before the voters in 2012: one to implement a voter ID law, and another to prohibit same-sex marriage. The ballot measures backfired spectacularly, fueling Democratic fundraising, organizing, and turnout. Dayton and the state party cited the shutdown and the marriage measure to paint Republicans as obstructionists and overreaching social crusaders. Two years after Dayton took office, Democrats were swept back into legislative control, (11-seat majority in the Senate, 12 seats in the House), and he finally had his chance. “When he won, expectations were a little low,” Bakk, the Senate majority leader, says of Dayton’s 2010 win. “I hear from people on the street all the time, ‘I’m really surprised by Mark Dayton.'” By 2013, it had been two decades since the DFL last controlled both the Legislature and the governorship, so every Democratic ally and interest group had a long wish list. But after years languishing in the minority of the US Senate and dealing with an obstinate GOP legislature, Dayton wasn’t going to let the opportunity to implement his agenda pass him by. “It was a very exciting opportunity,” Dayton says, noting that he’d tell hesitant allies that the voters had said “very decisively” said “they wanted to continue along on our DFL path.” He met regularly with progressive groups in the state to craft an agenda and devise strategies to push reluctant DFL legislators to take advantage of the window of one-party control. “He might not be as charismatic as other politicians out there, but he knows where he stands,” says Dan McGrath, head of TakeAction Minnesota, one of the progressive organizations that has worked closely with Dayton in crafting the new liberal regime. And, McGrath is more than happy to note, “he did not pay a political price for acting on his convictions.” Priority No. 1 was raising taxes on the rich. The final tax plan—which bumped up income taxes 2 percent for couples earning $250,000 per year—made Minnesota the fifth-highest tax state in the nation. But the hike paid for an arsenal of new programs. The same day Dayton signed the tax bill, he also approved a $429 million jobs bill. “He was unswayed by the consultants in the Democratic Party who were counseling Democrats to go to the middle to avoid the tax and spend label that is put on Democrats,” says Jacobs, the University of Minnesota political scientist. “Back when I first raised [the idea of] taxes on the richest Minnesotans in 2009,” Dayton says, “it was considered the kiss of death among even the Democratic political establishment of the country.” That might not have been the accepted wisdom, but Dayton now brags that he “won because of that issue,” and that “politically it was the right thing to do.” When DFL legislators dragged their feet on passing a bill to allow homecare health workers to form unions, the SEIU—with Dayton’s blessing—sent workers to invade the Capitol and make their presence felt. “Many, many long nights at the Capitol, sleeping on the floor literally waiting for these to go through,” Sumer Spika, one of those homecare workers, told me. Thanks to that law, she’s now in a union bargaining for higher wages ($10 an hour without benefits is standard, she says). “There were a few arms being twisted,” she says. “But we had the support from the governor, so that really helped us.” In the end, the Legislature passed the union bill Spika wanted. And pretty much everything else Dayton and outside liberal activists asked for. That two-year session is widely considered to be among the most active in recent memory by political observers in Minnesota. In 2014, Democrats lost the US Senate and governor’s mansions in blue states such as Maryland and Illinois. In Minnesota, Democrats lost control of the state House, where Republicans won a 10-seat majority by flipping rural districts that had voted for Mitt Romney two years prior. But outside those conservative redoubts, Dayton and his allies won. Democrats kept control of all statewide offices. Every Democratic member of Congress won reelection, including Al Franken and Reps. Colin Peterson and Rick Nolan, who had been top Republican targets. And Dayton cruised to reelection. Now Dayton is laying out a vision for further progressive changes. “This’ll be my last term,” he says. “I do not plan to run for anything else again. I’m 68 years old now, and I have four more years in this job and I love the freedom it gives me.” Since his second stint as governor began last month, Dayton has proposed a $6 billion transportation infrastructure bill that would fix the state’s aging highway system while beefing up public transit. He has suggested using the state’s new surplus for child care tax credits for middle-class families. And just last week, DFL legislators introduced a bill to guarantee paid sick time for workers, a cause Dayton told progressive activists he supports. “Dayton may remain the most liberal governor in the country in terms of his willingness to raise taxes and to spend,” Jacobs says. Without the state House, most of those goals are likely on hold for the moment. Dayton isn’t likely to duplicate the legislative success of the past two years, at least until 2016, when Democrats hope to regain full control of the Legislature. That was the point, however mangled, of Dayton’s speech in Eagan back in October: He can’t do it alone. Goalies can’t win games by themselves. “I needed a DFL House, a DFL Senate in order to get our agenda forward,” he told the crowd at the KFC. Without them, “the things that you’re celebrating here today like raising the minimum wage, all-day kindergarten, and early childhood education and tuition freezes” wouldn’t have happened. After his many years stuck in the net trying to deflect slapshots, Datyon wasn’t going to waste an opportunity like that.

        "articles": "We’ve done a fair bit of reporting now on the push, in Tennessee and other states, to essentially criminalize certain aspects of the Islamic faith. Two dozen states have now considered proposals to block judges from forcing Islamic Sharia law on God-fearing citizens, but no proposal is more extreme than Tennessee’s. As originally written, the bill classified Islamic law as treasonous, and made material support for Islam (a loosely defined phrasing that could have potentially applied to charitable donations to mosques) a felony. It’s since been modified, and its supporters say it doesn’t specifically target Islam. Well, except for the parts that do target Islam. Last week, the Tennessean published a few excerpts from a fascinating exchange between Aaron Nuell, a teacher in Murfreesboro, and GOP State Rep. Rick Womick, an avid supporter of the legislation. In an email to Nuell, Womick consistently refers to Muslims as “them,” and openly wonders whether Muslims who opposed the legislation are genuinely opposed to terrorism. I contacted Nuell to see if he could send the full correspondence and he obliged. (Read it below the fold.) Nuell emailed Womick last Wednesday, after reading a report about the lawmaker’s confrontation with a Muslim-American who had testified against the bill (and whose mosque had been attacked by arsonists three years earlier). Here’s their full exchange (typos, etc. in the original): Subject: A quick note… Please stop attacking your Muslim constituents. Some live in your district, and you were elected to represent them, too. You don’t get to pick who you represent; in contrast, you chose to represent a diverse community. Your behavior is extreme and your questioning is in bad faith. Mr. Aaron Nuell Murfreesboro, TN Womick responded later that night: Dear Mr. Nuell: I repectfully and politely sat and listened yesterday, to four individuals, one of which was Mr. Abudiab, publicly accuse me and my fellow legislators of denying them their Constitutional rights, infaming intolerance, false accusations, being hate mongerers, being racists, and being white supremicist like that of the KKK. And you write me to scold me because I dare speak up and defend my character and confront a political-militaristic-religion responsible for 10 out of the last 11 terrorist attack on Americans? Attacks that have killed over 3400 U.S. citizens! Well sir, get used to it. My duty is to the citizens of Tennessee and our Constitution. Not to those who want to usurp it and live under Sharia Law. My intent is not to deny any Muslim the freedom to worship; that is their First Amendment right. But I will not cower to their demands to implement Sharia Law over U.S. Constitutional Law. All this legislation does is adopt CUURENT FEDERAL TERRORISM LAWS and allows local and state law enforcement agencies to enforce those federal laws. So if their intent is to live peacfully within our laws, why are they opposed to this legislation? I have been studying Islam for over nine years now. Maybe you should take the time to study Islam and the Law that governs them…Sharia Law…before you turn a blind eye and accuse others of intolerance. Ignorance is bliss, and stupidity can get you killed. I suggest you educate yourself on both sides of the issue. Though we are at opposite ends of the spectrum, I do appreciate and respect your opinion and comment. Thank you for taking the time to contact me. Sincerely, Rick And Nuell’s closing shot: Mr. Womick, Thank for writing me back, however I feel the need to write a response. First, as a Jew, I would be quite upset – vocally so – if my legislators accused me and those of my faith of wanting to overthrow/usurp the Constitution of our great land. Do not claim that their anger is misplaced, as you act as their government as you speak out against them. I was raised a faithful Jew by a prominent Jewish father, and I now have a devout Muslims roommate with no issues/problems/terrorism/constitution-usurping in my household. He wakes up at 5AM to pray (before going back to sleep), and I want you to know that he is a moral and righteous person. No alcohol, no funny business. My question is this: Which Muslims are trying to usurp our constitution with Sharia law? Is it the family here in town who a small business selling cars? Is it the man who owns the independent, all-natural grocery store? Tell me who is fighting for this, and I will stand corrected, however if this is just the word-of-mouth from those highly-paid out-of-town Sharia law speakers, then I am forced to conclude that such a statement is based in paranoia and lies. Please, do your duty to defend the constitution and the people of our state, however don’t you assume that because of 9/11, all Muslims are “evil” or are hell-bent on destroying America. Yeah, there are crazies out their, but we’re not going to make this world a better or safer place by becoming extreme ourselves. As a political moderate and an independent voter, I pay close attention to what my government is doing, and I am not afraid to speak our when I see feelings, emotion, and hear-say getting in the way of good government.

        "articles": "The school of education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison never used to have trouble attracting applicants with dreams of becoming teachers. Its graduate program is ranked fourth in the country by U.S. News & World Report, and until recently, its undergraduate program in elementary education typically received between 300 and 400 applications for its 125 spots. Now, says Michael Apple, a professor in the program, it only gets about one applicant per opening. What happened? Scott Walker became Wisconsin’s governor in 2011 and promptly enacted a wide-scale rollback of unionization rights for state employees. That law, Act 10, effectively wiped out the ability of teachers and other public-sector workers to bargain collectively over salary and benefits. Walker’s assault on unions has had well-publicized effects, including an unsuccessful recall election against him, a sharp reduction in union membership, and a proliferation of anti-union legislation in other states. Unions’ diminished organizing power for Democrats helped Donald Trump become the first Republican presidential candidate to win Wisconsin in more than 30 years. But less visible consequences have colored nearly every facet of Wisconsin society. One is a sudden and drastic teacher shortage. “The attack on teacher unions has an echo that is often invisible,” Apple says. “That invisibility is many fewer teachers.” Wisconsin teachers now earn less total compensation than they did seven years ago, thanks to cuts in benefits. They face larger classes and less job security, and in some districts they’ve been asked to teach extra sections. Fewer people are applying to teacher education programs. One Wisconsin education student, who asked not to be named to avoid hurting his job prospects, warns that “better conditions and job security will lead some of us elsewhere.” The downturn for Wisconsin teachers is so bad that when a Minnesota public school district sent representatives to a job fair at UW-Madison’s education school last fall, they made a point of boasting about the benefits their state still offered. “I actually heard them promote having unions as a sales pitch, which I found interesting coming from administrators,” says the student. That Wisconsin is the front of the war on unions is particularly poignant. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which represents public workers at all levels of government, began as an association of local workers in Madison in 1932. Twenty-seven years later, Wisconsin became the first state to recognize state government employee unions. But when Walker signed Act 10 on March 11, 2011, that long chapter of progressivism came to an end and the state became a radical experiment in the opposite direction. The battle over the law was as dramatic as its effects: The entire 14-person Democratic caucus in the state Senate fled to Illinois in a bid to prevent it from passing, and about 100,000 union advocates demonstrated, with some camping in the hallways of the Capitol and singing union anthems. Teachers protested by calling in sick, and schools were forced to close. In the end, it wasn’t enough. Act 10 prevailed and other conservative state governments soon followed with their own anti-union legislation. It attacked public-sector unions from a variety of angles. Wisconsin workers can no longer negotiate to improve their health or retirement benefits. Raises can’t exceed the rate of inflation. Job-security measures like tenure were tossed aside, and managers were given the freedom to fire employees at will. Dues are no longer deducted directly from paychecks, forcing public-sector unions to track down members individually to raise funds. At the time, Walker sold Act 10 as a way to close a $3.6 billion budget gap. But there was never much question that the real motivation was to hobble liberal causes. A video later surfaced showing Walker hobnobbing with billionaire donor Diane Hendricks, founder and chairwoman of Wisconsin-based ABC Supply, two weeks after taking office. “Any chance we’ll ever get to be a completely red state and work on these unions and become a right-to-work?” she asked. (So-called right-to-work laws slash union revenue by prohibiting unions from compelling employees to pay dues, allowing employees to benefit from a union’s efforts without contributing their share.) Walker replied, “The first step is, we’re going to deal with collective bargaining for all public employee unions, because you use divide and conquer.” That strategy could soon become national policy. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser, has pointed to Walker’s anti-union crusade as a model for how the new administration could target public-­sector unions at the federal level. Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, chaired a group called the American Federation for Children, which claims it has spent more than $4.2 million on Wisconsin races since 2010. The AFC tapped Walker as its keynote speaker at the group’s 2015 policy summit. Six years after the passage of Act 10, a small band of retirees still gathers in the Capitol rotunda every weekday at noon for a pro-union Solidarity Sing-Along. But it barely draws the attention of passing school groups, let alone lawmakers. State labor organizations, struggling to maintain their membership rolls, have little time or money to press legislators for policy changes. One AFSCME council saw its budget drop from $5 million before Act 10 to $1.5 million in 2013. Before Walker’s crusade, 14.2 percent of Wisconsin’s workforce belonged to a union. By 2015, that figure had dropped to 8.3 percent, significantly below the national average for the first time. That year, Walker and the Legislature passed a law that extended the right-to-work provisions to private-sector unions as well. That law’s central provision is still on hold pending legal challenges. It’s no coincidence that 2016 was the first election in which the state voted Republican for president since Ronald Reagan. According to exit polls, Hillary Clinton won union households in the state by 10 percentage points. But 79 percent of voters didn’t belong to a union household, and they went in Trump’s favor by 8 points—enough to deliver him a surprise victory in Wisconsin. “Scott Walker just won the presidential race in 2016 by passing Act 10 five years ago,” anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist tweeted on election night. Teachers’ unions have been hit hardest. Prior to the law, the Wisconsin Education Association Council (WEAC)—the state’s largest association of local teachers’ unions and an affiliate of the National Education Association—counted about 98,000 members. Now it has fewer than 40,000. The WEAC spent $93,481 on lobbying in 2015, compared with more than $2.2 million in 2011. The union recently put its Madison headquarters up for sale to shore up its finances. As unions have lost their sway, teaching has become a less attractive profession. School districts have struggled to hire and retain teachers. A study from the Milwaukee-based Public Policy Forum found that between the 2008-09 and 2013-14 school years, the number of people entering Wisconsin teacher-training programs declined by 28 percent and the number of teachers in the state dropped by 2.4 percent, even as the number of students remained nearly constant. In 2013, schools attracted an average of 4.9 applicants per open teaching position, according to data from the Wisconsin Education Career Access Network. By 2015, that average had dipped to 3.3 applicants. Last August, with the start of the school year weeks away, state Superintendent Tony Evers was forced to offer more emergency one-year teaching licenses in order to expand the pool of applicants. Act 10 has thinned the ranks of both veteran teachers and younger ones. Thanks to the old collective bargaining agreements, Wisconsin teachers used to enjoy generous benefits that allowed people to retire at age 55 and receive a full pension, though many teachers continued teaching into their 60s. But Act 10 threatened to strip away those benefits once the agreements expired, leading many teachers who were eligible for retirement to make their exit years earlier than planned. “We lost a lot of people who developed the expertise over the years to reach kids at their various learning styles,” says John Matthews, who led Madison’s teachers’ union for 48 years. “Those people were leaving en masse.” The teachers who remain, meanwhile, have been forced to take on extra work to make up for the shortage. The La Crosse school district, for example, tried to solve budget problems by saddling its newest high school teachers with an additional class, at the expense of time spent developing a curriculum and grading papers. John Havlicek, a Spanish teacher in his 21st year and a union representative, says he’s never seen so few teachers take on secondary roles as coaches—they simply don’t have the time for sports. “Within two years, you had teachers leaving because they just couldn’t keep up,” Havlicek says. “It doesn’t seem like it, but 30 more kids and one less period in which to help kids who come in for help was a double whammy.” (The school district is rolling back the change after pressure from teachers and parents.) In 2011, Walker signed legislation that cut the state’s K-12 education funding by $792 million over two years. If districts want to increase taxes for school funding, they’re required to hold referendums. Last November, 67 such measures were on ballots across the state, with 55 passing. Schools are also getting crunched by state Republicans’ zeal for voucher programs that use public funds to send students to religious and other private schools. Walker has called vouchers a “moral imperative” and expanded their use in 2015, lifting income caps for families to qualify. That year, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction warned that school districts would receive less funding because of the voucher program. In the two years since, those schools have lost $41.4 million. “The shortage of money is causing class sizes to be larger than they should be,” Matthews says. “It’s causing teachers not to have the resources like new textbooks, workbooks. Those resources just aren’t there. And there’s been a cutback in assistance work in the classrooms, a cutback in music, art, and phys-ed teachers. It’s hit the quality of education.” With unions diminished at the state level, conservatives have shifted their attention to weakening them and their influence in liberal cities where they remain relatively strong. In the old manufacturing city of Kenosha, the school board continued to negotiate with the local teachers’ union, although it didn’t have to under Act 10. So in a 2014 election, Americans for Prosperity—­the main political arm of the Koch brothers—got involved in the school board race, in which two seats held by vocally pro-union members were up for grabs. The group set up phone banks and sent people campaigning door to door. The incumbents were replaced with anti-union candidates. Act 10 requires annual recertification elections in which at least 51 percent of all eligible members—including those who don’t show up—must vote in favor of a union to keep the chapter alive. Bob Peterson, the head of the Milwaukee teachers’ union from 2011 to 2015, says these annual elections can cost thousands of dollars and force unions to run full-scale phone-banking operations. Last year, 11 WEAC affiliates lost recertification votes. In the small eastern Wisconsin town of New Holstein, all 42 teachers who voted backed recertification, but there were another 42 members who didn’t vote, so the local union disappeared. Peterson has warned his peers in other states for years that Wisconsin could be the test case for the country. “I generally start out by saying, ‘I’m from Wisconsin,'” he explains. “‘I’m from your future. There’s some lessons to learn.’ I sort of thought I was exaggerating, but with the Trump election I don’t think I was. What has gone on in Wisconsin for the last five and a half years is what very well could happen nationwide.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Walter Russell Mead, in yet another lengthy critique of liberals who think that facts and empirical evidence ought to be taken seriously, explains to Al Gore the role of the referee in professional wrestling: Among other things, professional wrestling works as a kind of folk satire — and well meaning progressives and professionals like Mr. Gore are among its targets. The clownish referee represents exactly the well intentioned bumblers who seek to arbitrate and rationalize the endless competition between the good and the bad guys. It is the way much of the working class looks at ivory tower intellectuals, nanny state do-gooders. ….In other words, the referee in a professional wrestling match strikes a chord in popular culture in part because he is a representation of the class which sets itself up in our society as the arbiter and judge: the professional elite, the expert and the chattering classes. The referee at a wrestling match is a populist portrait of the FCC, the NLRB, NPR, the New York Times editorial board and everyone else who does exactly what Al Gore would like to spend his whole life doing: judging mankind impartially and ruling them well. The referee is part of the entertainment who is funny in part because he thinks he is above the fray. My first instinct was to mock Mead for writing this drivel, but hell, maybe he’s right. Thanks to the now total success of movement conservatism and its assimilation of confederates like him, I guess that anyone still naive enough to care about facts and evidence really is about as ineffectual and irrelevant as your typical WWE referee. I only wish that guys like Mead would fess up to their role in this evolution, instead of pretending that it’s the inevitable hydraulic consequence of some vague but inexorable tidal wave of modernism and techno-empowerment engulfing us all. It ain’t so. This wasn’t a global historical imperative, it was a deliberate, considered choice — and a largely American one — driven by all the usual parochial forces of money, power, privilege, and corporate ascendance that have been with us forever.

        "articles": "A month after President Donald Trump took office, khalid kamau was eating lunch in the cluttered kitchen of the Mayday Space, a leftist community center in Brooklyn. A year earlier, the 39-year-old (who prefers to spell his name without capital letters) had been driving a bus in Atlanta. Then his life took a hard left turn. When the city slashed public pensions, he became a union organizer. He then launched a Black Lives Matter chapter, became a delegate for Sen. Bernie Sanders, and led a walkout at the Democratic National Convention when Hillary Clinton clinched the nomination. In December, kamau announced his candidacy for City Council in South Fulton, Georgia. Not long after that, he joined the Democratic Socialists of America. kamau, who was wearing a black T-shirt that said, “Don’t let your new president get your ass whooped,” had been a DSA member for all of a few weeks, but he already had big plans. Leaning forward on his wooden stool, he said, “I want to be the Obama of democratic socialism.” First, kamau needed to win an election. Which is why, on an unseasonably warm weekend in February, he had come to Brooklyn for the Revolution at the Crossroads conference, a gathering of about 300 teen and twentysomething leftists that was sponsored by the Young Democratic Socialists, a subgroup of the DSA. After speaking on the kickoff panel the night before, kamau had taught the attendees how to use the free canvassing app MiniVAN and signed up dozens of volunteers for his campaign. (His organizing paid off; last Tuesday, kamau won his runoff election with 67 percent of the vote.) Founded in 1982, the DSA claims to be the largest socialist organization in the country. It’s not a political party along the lines of the Communist Party USA or the Green Party. Many of its members are Democrats or the kind of left-­leaning independents who usually vote for Democrats. But just as the Obama era ushered in a boomlet of libertarianism on the right, the DSA is banking on Trump to make socialism great again. Its goal is not just to stop Trump’s worst policies, but to push the political conversation on the left even further to the left through a mix of political action and cultural engagement. There are signs it’s already working. Fueled by disenchantment with the traditional institutions of the Democratic Party, the promise of Sanders’ candidacy, and the specter of Trumpism, DSA membership has more than doubled since the election. The DSA now boasts more than 20,000 members and more than 120 local chapters. Sure, you could fit just about everyone comfortably inside Madison Square Garden, but being a socialist hasn’t been this cool in years. “The Bernie campaign really opened that Overton Window,” said Winnie Wong, a 41-year-old activist who co-founded the group People for Bernie and coined the phrase “Feel the Bern.” “We funneled thousands of people, hundreds of thousands—15 million people!—through to the other side. Are those people democratic socialists? No. Do they feel comfortable with the idea of socialism? Well, yeah! Because they voted for it.” Normalizing socialism, she said, is “the most important thing we can do.” Revolution at the Crossroads existed in a parallel universe to other political confabs, such as the Conservative Political Action Conference, known for its corporate sponsors, bad suits, and ritzy Beltway hotels. The opening panel was delayed because the speaker system was picking up an AM radio station. An attendee joked that “neoliberal capitalism”—”neoliberal” being the epithet of choice among the DSA set—was to blame. Sleeping bags littered the side walls. The dress code was plaid. Socialism’s hipster makeover has been accelerated by a flowering of leftist media and culture. The DSA’s unofficial hype man is not Sanders—who is not a member—but the comedian Rob Delaney, who joined up after the election, inspired by his positive experiences with the British National Health Service as an expat living in England. Delaney has tweeted about the DSA more than 100 times since November and describes himself as a “fucking cockroach” for socialism, because of his persistence. “A lot of people have written me and said that they’ve joined because I won’t shut up about Democratic Socialists on Twitter,” he told me. He even raised money to defray expenses for some of the students who traveled to Brooklyn. A popular gateway drug for democratic socialists is Chapo Trap House, a podcast hosted by a small clique of millennial Sandernistas that takes its deliberately head-scratching name from the jailed Mexican cartel king. It is incisive and irreverent but often scathing toward politicians, journalists, or anyone else insufficiently in line with its politics. (For instance: Clinton is an “entitled fucking slob,” and Democratic leaders should have “fucking killed themselves” after losing the election.) Outside the conference, activists hawked Workers Vanguard, the ubiquitous Trotskyist newspaper. But inside, students chatted with writers from the two-year-old journal Current Affairs (“the world’s first readable political publication”) and Jacobin, a quarterly launched in 2010 by Bhaskar Sunkara, then an undergrad at George Washington University. Jacobin aims to do for socialism what National Review did for conservatism half a century ago. It’s polemical but not stodgy; its writers are as likely to discourse on the NBA as they are to inveigh against Uber. The magazine’s audience doubled, to 30,000 subscribers, in the four months after the election. At the conference, where he was selling the most recent issue from a folding table along the wall, Sunkara, also a vice chair of the DSA, was a minor celebrity. “I think there’s a feeling that with the center kind of defeated, or at the very least temporarily discredited, we are the new center-left,” he told me. That newfound popularity has caused him to rethink the limitations of leftist politics. “Compared to where the goalposts were five years ago, we’re already basically there,” he said. Socialists won’t run Washington by 2020—but maybe they will in his lifetime. But the DSA’s continued growth is hardly guaranteed. One challenge as it seeks to broaden its appeal is messaging. Members of the new socialist vanguard pride themselves on a certain degree of unfiltered vulgarity, and they target mainline liberals as often as they do Trump-backing conservatives. Amber A’Lee Frost, a Chapo co-host and YDS panelist, has referred to her cohort’s style as the “Dirtbag Left.” Frost contends that rudeness is essential to disrupting the political status quo. It is, however, a weird way to make new friends. Coalition politics are hard when everyone else is a sellout. More pressing than its inability to play nice is the movement’s inescapable whiteness. If the audience at the conference was any indication, the DSA’s future is doomed to demographic failure—a point kamau emphasized on the event’s opening night. “I want you to look around the room,” he said, “and then I want you to realize that we’re in Flatbush, Brooklyn, right?” It was Bushwick, but the point stood. “I love Bernie, but I also think that the leaders of the Democratic Party and the leaders of the left are going to have to come to terms with the fact that the American left is a movement of black and brown people,” he told me. “And the leadership of the Democratic Party doesn’t look like that—the leadership of the DSA doesn’t look like that.” In South Fulton, a mostly working-class, African American community of 100,000 people, kamau sees an opportunity to broaden the appeal of democratic socialism. He believed his race, which was nonpartisan, was a chance to act on a DSA manifesto that calls for running “openly democratic socialist candidates for local office, in and outside the Democratic Party,” and “taking out pro-corporate, neoliberal Democrats.” YDS had given each conferencegoer a three-page reading list with titles by writers such as Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, and Barbara Ehrenreich. Wong suggested that young socialists study up on the hard lessons of electoral politics instead. “Learn about the mechanics it takes to win these elections,” she said. “You’re not gonna learn those by reading all three volumes of Capital, I promise you.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "<a  Hawk</a>/Flickr Call it justicia divina. After serving for months as punching bags for Republican candidates, Latinos may ultimately decide the outcome of the race. An upcoming report from two GOP consulting firms argues that Latino votes in California could prove decisive in 11 of the state’s 53 congressional districts—a swath that confers more delegates than 20 other states combined. “If Trump is going to be held under 1,237″—the number of delegates needed to avoid a contested convention—”it will largely be the result of Latino Republicans voting against his candidacy,” says Mike Madrid, whose firm, Grassroots Lab, co-authored the report with the GOP analytics firm Murphy Nasica. Latino Republicans have far more clout than their numbers would suggest. Fewer than 1 in 5 California GOPers is Latino, but Madrid calculates that their primary votes, on average, will be worth a staggering 6.5 times more than those of the average white voter. This situation stems from the state GOP’s quirky rules. Each congressional district confers three delegates in a winner-take-all election, regardless of how many Republicans live there. So a majority-white district in Orange County with 166,000 Republicans is worth the same as a majority-Latino one in East Lost Angeles with just 30,000 Republicans. In other words, those Republicans living in Democratic districts have the most powerful votes, and a disproportionate number of those Republicans, Madrid calculates, are Latinos. “Finding Latino Republicans in these districts is like finding the Holy Grail,” he says. “The irony is that those votes have become the most effective and valuable for amassing delegates, but they are extremely hard to find because the party has not been there [in these areas] for 25 years.” The Cruz campaign has invested heavily in targeting Latino-heavy districts in the Central Valley, Los Angeles County, and east of San Diego, with phone banking and precinct walking. “We are the only campaign that has the organization to do it,” says Mike Schroeder, the campaign’s California co-chair. “It’s not complicated; it’s simple, basic, nuts-and-bolts politics.” But it’s also an uphill climb for an ultraconservative candidate like Cruz, who has staked out positions on immigration nearly identical to Trump’s. Cruz’s lead among Latino Republicans in California stands at a mere 4 percent and is unlikely to widen much before the June 7 primary, Madrid speculates. “Cruz has built his entire operation in appealing to Southern, white evangelicals,” he says. “It’s too late to pivot.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Florida Gov. Rick Scott.<a  Skidmore</a>/Flickr In response to hazing scandals at Florida A&M University that left one student dead, Florida Gov. Rick Scott has demanded the suspension of A&M’s president, James Ammons. But students at Florida A&M, a historically black college in Tallahassee, the state capital, don’t want Scott meddling with their business, and so on Thursday night, they marched on the governor’s mansion and gave Scott an earful. To his credit, Scott, clad in sweatpants, greeted the marchers outside his home. To his detriment, he decided to talk. Apparently grasping for some common ground, Scott began his speech by reminding the protesters that he’d lived in public housing as a youngster. The Florida A&M marchers were less than pleased. “We’re not poor!” one of them shouted back. Another, A&M student senate president Marissa West, told the Miami Herald that Scott’s remarks offended her. “I guess he was trying to make some type of relation to our student body, as if we had lived in public housing,” she said. More on the march, from the Herald: Students marched en masse from their campus to the Governor’s Mansion, about a 2-mile walk, at about 9 p.m. chanting “We are FAMU!” After about 30 minutes of chanting from outside Scott’s guarded gate, chief of staff Steve MacNamara told West and Student Body President Breyon Love that Scott had just returned from a trip to Israel and was sleeping, West said. Not long after, she said, Scott came out and ventured into the crowd wearing sweats. He grabbed a megaphone and took part in a Q&A with Love about funding FAMU and worries that it would merge with Florida State. He said he knew nothing about either topic, West said. But Scott didn’t say he would rescind his recommendation to suspend Ammons, so many students remained on his lawn. “This is not the time for FAMU to be without its university president,” West said. “We believe in our university president.” It wasn’t the first time Scott’s public housing yarn blew up in his face. In February, Scott, a first-term governor elected in 2010, made a similar quip to a room full of black, Democratic lawmakers, also at the governor’s mansion, the St. Petersburg Times reported. “I grew up probably in the same situation as you guys,” he said. “I started school in public housing. My dad had a sixth-grade education.” Needless to say, not all the lawmakers in the room empathized with Scott’s hard-luck story.

        "articles": "DIGIcal/iStockphoto In an in-depth investigation in 2013, Mother Jones found that guns kill hundreds of children per year in the United States. Many die in homicides, and many others die in accidents—mostly when children themselves pull the trigger. The kids shooting themselves or others have often been as young as two or three years old. Invariably these “tragedies” result from adults leaving unsecured firearms lying around in their homes or, in some cases, in their cars. Since our investigation, the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety has collected additional data confirming the scope of the problem. As the New York Times reported on Thursday, during one week in April four toddlers around the country killed themselves with guns, and a mother was fatally shot by her two-year-old while driving, after the child apparently picked up a weapon that slid out from under the driver’s seat. The data remains stark: “In 2015, there were at least 278 unintentional shootings at the hands of young children and teenagers, according to Everytown’s database,” the Times reported. “A child who accidentally pulls the trigger is most likely to be 3 years old, the statistics show.” Equally stark is the response from the gun lobby. There has been growing debate about laws aimed at reducing the problem, which, as our investigation showed, has long gone underreported. Larry Pratt, a leading figure among hardline pro-gun activists, argues that tighter gun regulations are not the answer. In comments to the Times, Pratt called the hundreds of child gun deaths that occur each year “occasional mishaps”: “It’s clearly a tragedy, but it’s not something that’s widespread,” said Larry Pratt, a spokesman and former executive director of Gun Owners of America. “To base public policy on occasional mishaps would be a grave mistake.” As the Times piece notes, 27 states now have laws that hold adults responsible for letting unsupervised children get their hands on guns. Gun safety advocates have increasingly pushed for tougher laws requiring owners to use trigger locks, gun safes, or other measures for safe storage and use. Another potential solution that’s been gaining new interest is smart-gun technology. But gun lobbying groups including Gun Owners of America and the National Rifle Association have long opposed these policies across the board, claiming that they threaten Americans’ Second Amendment rights. Even in states with laws on the books, the contentious politics tends to quash appetite among prosecutors for holding adults accountable when young children accidentally kill. Here, the data goes from stark to perhaps stunning: In 2013 we documented 52 cases where adults had left their guns unsecured—but we could only find four people who were held criminally liable for the children’s deaths. The following year I covered this problem in more detail, in a story chronicling the rise of a new advocacy group, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Particularly in more rural communities, a prevailing theme has been that parents—including a few who accidentally shot their own children—have already suffered enough and shouldn’t be punished: Last Christmas Eve in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a man who’d been “messing with” a 9 mm handgun unintentionally shot and killed his two-month-old daughter as she slept in her glider. The coroner ruled the death a homicide, yet local law enforcement officials said they were undecided about pursuing criminal charges. Typically that might’ve been the end of it, but Moms Demand Action voiced outrage via social media and the local press. Within two weeks the DA announced plans to prosecute. (He said no outside group influenced his decision.) “While we fully support the father being held accountable for this crime, we also acknowledge the horrific grief this family is experiencing,” Moms Demand Action said after the charges were announced. “We hope their tragedy can serve as an example that encourages others to be more responsible with their firearms.” The father later pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment, which could have brought up to 15 years in prison. He got six years’ probation and no jail time. Moms also drew attention to a case in February in North Carolina, where a three-year-old boy wounded his 17-month-old sister after finding a handgun that their father—who wrote a parenting advice column in a local paper—had left unsecured. (The infant recovered.) “The parents have been punished more than any criminal justice system can do to them,” a captain from the county sheriff’s department said soon after the shooting. After Moms swung into action, the father was charged with failure to secure his firearm to protect a minor; his case is pending. “All too often DAs are loath to get involved, saying a family has suffered enough,” Watts says, “especially in states where laws are inadequate…This idea of ‘accidental’ gun deaths, when something is truly negligence, has to be remedied.” For its part, the gun lobby prefers to keep the focus on other fears. On Thursday, the NRA made no reference to the latest data on child gun deaths. On its blog, a post—topped by an image of a toddler biking—offered “10 Tips That Could Save Your Life.” The “home” segment of the list made no mention of safely storing firearms, but instead focused on the specter of a home invasion. “To deal with this possibility,” it said, “be prepared by making a home defense plan and setting up a safe room with your family.” The room should be equipped with a phone for calling 911, it said, and a “personal protection device” such as “mace, batons, Tasers, stun guns, or firearm.” The NRA’s Twitter feed otherwise attended to politics, denouncing an apparent conspiracy by the Social Security Administration to conduct “the largest gun grab in American history,” and firing away at “Hillary Clinton’s 6-part plan to disarm citizens — and rip apart the #2A.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Flickr/<a  The 10 members of a Florida-based neo-Nazi militant group arrested last week received training in close-quarters combat and other Army-approved tactics from a member of the US Army National Guard, according to court filings. The co-conspirators, alleged to be members of the violent white-power American Front, face felony charges for hate crimes, paramilitary training, and preparing for a coming “race war” against blacks, Jews, and immigrants at a fortified compound in the marshlands of St. Cloud, Florida, just south of the amusement-park haven of Orlando. A short paragraph buried in the group’s arrest affidavit shows a disturbing link between the Florida gang and a US military employee: Who is Ryan Riley, and how has he been able to lead the life of both a trained American soldier and a card-carrying neo-Nazi? I’ve reached out to the Missouri National Guard and the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office, who booked the Florida conspirators, for comment. Both said they’d get back to me and I’ll add an update as soon as they do. On the phone, the Guard’s public affairs officer sounded surprised by the allegations, as if she hadn’t heard them before. An Osceola County deputy involved in the case declined to comment about Riley in detail because the investigation—a cooperative effort with state authorities and the FBI—was still open, he said. Riley has “not been caught yet,” he said. We’ve reported before on military members joining Oathkeepers, a “patriot” group full of tin-foil hat theories and anti-government plans. And many of the nation’s most infamous political criminals and terrorists—from Lee Harvey Oswald to Timothy McVeigh to Nidal Malik Hasan—were veterans. But it would be unfair to the majority of conscientious service members to overstate a link between military service and violent radicalism. As conservative military blogger Jonn Lilyea points out, “One guy in the Missouri National Guard doesn’t a conspiracy make.” On the other hand, one active soldier with alleged terrorist connections—domestic or otherwise—is one too many. If Riley is in fact using his military know-how to prepare for war with American blacks and Jews, it’s fair to ask what the military can do to keep guys like him out of uniform.

        "urls": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/jeb-bush-biggest-nightmare-common-core",
        "articles": "Brendan Fitterer/Tampa Bay Times/ZUMA I met Jeb Bush’s biggest nightmare during a breakout session at March’s Conservative Political Action Conference held outside of DC. In a side room, Phyllis Schlafly, the octogenarian den mother of the religious right, was explaining why attendees should be afraid of a set of national educational standards, little noticed by the national political press, called Common Core. The standards are arguably Bush’s biggest political legacy. They are also the source of a rising tide of activism on the political right. One after another, conservative activists in the standing-room-only audience stood up to express their alarm. “If you are a white male boy—God forbid you’re Jewish!—you’re being targeted and it’s very scary,” fretted a woman from Texas. “Very scary.” Cheryl Howell of Herndon, Virginia, handed me a folded scrap of paper after the discussion. It traced a direct progression from Common Core to a slate of globalist proposals activists on the far-right believe are designed to create a borderless international society—Agenda 21, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the United Nations’ Law of the Sea treaty. At the center of it all, she said, pointing to the paper, was Jeb Bush. In recent weeks, Bush—the former governor of Florida, brother of the 43rd president, and son of the 41st—has emerged as the Republican Party’s presidential sleeper of the moment, a political heavyweight who could commandeer the nervous donor class, lure Latino voters back to the GOP, and stand toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton. But if Bush runs, he’ll have to contend with an obstacle every bit as daunting as his last name—Common Core. His educational nonprofit, the Foundation for Excellence in Education, has been a leading supporter of Common Core, and he has recently joined another group, Conservatives for Higher Standards, to defend the standards against what he calls an “avalanche” of opposition. If that avalanche grows any bigger, it threatens to block any path Bush may have to becoming the Republican Party’s 2016 standard-bearer. Adopted five years ago by 45 states, the guidelines are designed to provide a modicum of standardization across the country, so that a child in Idaho and a child in Florida might reasonably be expected to learn the same things at the same times. From the start, the standards were derided by some conservatives for the expenses they would bring, or as a power grab that would erode local control, water down existing state curricula, or, yes, even brainwash children with leftist material. But it’s only in the last two years, as students have begun to take the Core-compliant standardized tests, that parents—and in turn, politicians and key right-leaning news outlets—have begun to take note. Glenn Beck, who has called Common Core “the biggest story in American history,” is writing a book about the standards. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) signed a letter demanding the federal government stop funding it. Building the Machine, a new anti-Core documentary modeled after the viral video campaign to stop Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony, has been viewed 150,000 times in the two weeks since its release. Fox News bashes it on a daily basis. Even Stephen Colbert has taken on Common Core. Like any good conspiracy, Common Core has a lot of villains. The standards were conceived in a paper by two men, David Coleman and Jason Zimba, a classicist and a physicist, respectively, who studied together at Oxford as Rhodes Scholars. Development and implementation of the standards was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which boosted them by pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into state departments of education, school districts, unions, universities, and educational nonprofits. The US Department of Education enticed states to come on board with $4.35 billion in funding from a stimulus program called Race to the Top. But to the extent that there is a political villain outside Washington, it’s Bush. He’s been the standards’ biggest cheerleader, crisscrossing the country to sell Republicans and business groups on his idea of a corporate educational makeover. And unlike other Republicans on the 2016 short list, many of whom have started questioning the standards, Bush is not backing down. “If you’re comfortable with mediocrity, fine,” he told critics in a speech at the National Press Club in February. The testing, he said at an event in Florida’s Broward County last month, is “truth serum for our communities.” And at a speech in Boston last fall, Bush played the tin-foil-hat card. “Criticisms and conspiracy theories are easy attention grabbers. Solutions are hard work.” In March, he kicked off a 10-week ad campaign to whip up support for the embattled standards. Now, even politicians who are featured in pro-Common Core literature are getting cold feet—or in some cases, deliberately undermining the standards. Last month, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, like Bush a 2016 contender popular among the Chamber of Commerce crowd, backed a bill in his state’s Legislature that would have suspended implementation of Common Core and formed a committee to study it. When the bill died, Jindal promised to unilaterally remove Louisiana from the standards (something he lacks the power to actually do). Likewise, Scott Walker, Wisconsin’s Republican governor, supported the program at first but recently reversed course. Ditto former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Bush’s steadfast support for Common Core has left many activists on the right at a loss. Some say he means well but has been co-opted by leftists. But Michelle Malkin, a best-selling conservative author and television commentator, holds a more typical view. She accuses Bush of corporate self-interest, highlighting his own close ties to private education companies. “There are Republicans and there are conservatives—conservatives would look at this and say, ‘This is not a good idea; why are we doing this?'” says Jane Robbins, a senior fellow at the American Principles Project, when I ask about Bush. “You have the elite crony capitalist wing of the party that supports it.” According to its loudest opponents, Common Core isn’t just education reform—it’s a literally life-and-death issue. Tim Farley, a principal from Kinderhook, New York, told me about two of his students who attempted suicide and about several others who had begun cutting themselves. Although he lacked definitive evidence, he believed it was because of the strains of the new standards. Dr. Gary Thompson, a Utah-based child psychologist who has testified in front of state legislators on the standards and has appeared on Beck’s program, called Common Core “child abuse.” Want other horror stories? Just Google “Common Core Syndrome.” If Bush runs, he could take comfort in the example of past candidates who managed to capture the nomination despite being on the wrong side of an issue causing fits among the grassroots. Building the blueprint for the Affordable Care Act didn’t prevent former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney from becoming the party’s nominee in 2012. But Romney could at least draw offer an alibi, however shaky, that health care reform was a state issue. Bush so far is unrepentant in his backing of Common Core, or in his fundamental belief in national education standards. A recent analysis by statistical guru Nate Silver concluded that Bush doesn’t have much to worry about because most Republican voters either don’t know what Common Core is or don’t think it is so bad. But the data Silver was working with was from June 2013, when the backlash to the standards was only just beginning to coalesce. It’s only in the last year, as schools have begun to align their curricula to prepare for the first round of testing, that activists have seized on the issue as a political wedge. Maybe in holding fast Bush knows something that Jindal and Walker don’t. No matter how much he may be appreciated by the party’s donor class, among the growing swath of conservatives worried about Common Core, he’s got some explaining to do. “We have George Soros, we have Bill Gates, we have Jeb Bush, we have Mike Huckabee, and you would think that those would be very strange bedfellows, but in fact they are the corporate elitists,” Chris Quackenbush, a cofounder of Stop Common Core Florida, told me. “The idea is to control us peons because we don’t know anything.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "<a  Kos</a> If this week’s revelation that 58 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana is surprising, it’s mainly because legalization remains so taboo within the GOP. Republicans account for only 6 of the 20 cosponsors of the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2013, the live-and-let live pot bill authored by their conservative California colleague, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (who admittedly marches to his own drummer). Yet drug policy isn’t the only area where the GOP orthodoxy is out of step with prevailing views. Here are five other things that most Americans want but Congressional Republicans consider crazy talk: 1) Same-sex marriage: Remember the name of that GOP presidential contender who equated legalizing gay marriage to sanctioning bestiality or pedophilia? Don’t worry, in a few years nobody will. More than half of Americans already think that same-sex marriage ought to be legal. 2) Higher taxes on the rich: Republicans threw a fit earlier this year when President Obama proposed raising taxes on people who earn more than $250,000. But 6 in 10 Americans think the country’s wealth should be more evenly distributed, and a majority wants to accomplish that by taxing the rich. 3) Reducing emissions: The GOP has painted Obama’s new standards for power plants as an ominous “war on coal.” Call it whatever you want, but nearly two-thirds of Americans—including a majority of everyday Republicans—support tighter limits on carbon emissions from power plants. 4) Keeping the federal government open: Americans may not love Obamacare, but a good majority thinks that protesting the law by shutting down the federal government was a terrible idea. 5) Immigration reform: The GOP’s immigration hard-liners constantly decry “amnesty,” which they define as pretty much any plan other than immediately deporting America’s 11.7 million undocumented immigrants. “Conservatives will not support a wrapped-up present with amnesty inside,” Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas), vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Issues, told Breitbart News this week. Never mind that a huge majority of Americans wants to give illegal immigrants a path to legal citizenship.

        "articles": "Amy Cicconi/Alamy; trekandshoot/shutterstock Trolls and libertarians rejoice. In a highly watched case that explored the tough question of what distinguishes protected free speech from illegal threats, the Supreme Court on Monday made it harder for the government to prosecute individuals who are making threatening statements toward others. The court voided the conviction of Anthony Elonis, who was found guilty of issuing unlawful threats over Facebook with rants that referred to killing his estranged wife. Elonis argued that his posts, which were presented as rap lyrics, were a form of expression protected by the First Amendment. He was convicted in federal district court in Pennsylvania under the “reasonable person” standard: Would a reasonable person consider Elonis’ posts threatening? In a 7-2 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that the reasonable person test wasn’t sufficient for a criminal conviction like this one. Avoiding touchy First Amendment questions, the court determined that Elonis’ posts should have been evaluated under a tougher standard that takes his mental state into account. That is, did he intend to follow through on his threats or did he know that his words would be seen as a threat? “Elonis’s conviction was premised solely on how his posts would be viewed by a reasonable person, a standard…inconsistent with the conventional criminal conduct requirement of ‘awareness of some wrongdoing,'” Roberts wrote. He noted that a criminal conviction could only be supported “if the defendant transmits a communication for the purpose of issuing a threat or with knowledge that the communication will be viewed as a threat.” The case presented a difficult First Amendment question pitting freedom of expression against the freedom to not be threatened with violence. But the justices ducked the matter. The ruling was predicated on a statutory interpretation. Elonis was sentenced to 44 months in prison for threatening to harm and even kill his estranged wife in Facebook posts—threats that left his wife afraid for her safety. Elonis fought the charges, arguing that he could not be imprisoned because he never intended to hurt his wife. A criminal conviction for someone who had no intent to harm, he contended, violated the Constitution’s guarantee of freedom of speech. But the trial court disagreed and instructed the jury to use the reasonable-person standard. The federal government argued that the reasonable person test is the best way to determine whether a statement is a threat. Its lawyers maintained that even if there is no intent to harm, such threats can severely disrupt the lives of those people targeted. Civil liberties groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, supported Elonis, fearing an encroachment on free-speech rights. Advocates for victims of domestic violence, though, argued that victims of domestic abuse “suffer the devastating psychological and economic effects of threats of violence, which their abusers deliver more and more often via social media,” according to an amicus brief. This brief, filed by the National Network to End Domestic Violence and a number of state-based anti-domestic-violence groups, argued that threats are often a precursor to actual violence. The Elonis case was argued before the court in early December and the justices took a full six months to decide the case. Roberts was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and the court’s liberal wing. Justice Samuel Alito joined in part and dissented in part. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented.

        "articles": "State of the Union George Floyd is only the latest in a long line of unarmed African-Americans killed by police in the past few years. Nearly 50 percent of the unarmed people killed by officers from the country’s 100 biggest police departments between 2013 and 2019 were black. Yet on Sunday, after “State of the Union” host Jake Tapper asked Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, whether he thought systemic racism was a problem in US law enforcement agencies, he insisted police brutality was simply a problem of a few “bad apples.” “No, I don’t think there’s systemic racism,” O’Brien told Tapper. “I think ninety-nine point nine percent of our law enforcement officers are great Americans. Many of them are African American, Hispanic, Asian, they’re working the toughest neighborhood, they’ve got the hardest jobs to do in this country and I think they’re amazing, great Americans.” “No, I don’t think there’s systemic racism,” White House National Security adviser Robert O’Brien says about US law enforcement agencies. “There’s a few bad apples that are giving law enforcement a terrible name” #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/Tdwo9XfTQ7 — State of the Union (@CNNSotu) May 31, 2020 Conservatives have long hated the suggestion that law enforcement might be plagued by systemic racism, and have for years clung to the bad-apple theory of police brutality. But systemic racism doesn’t mean that each and every member of law enforcement is a racist. It means, as Tapper suggested, that the system as a whole creates racially disparate outcomes—like the one in Ferguson, Missouri, another city famous for police shootings, that resulted in 95 percent of all jaywalking tickets going to African-Americans, even though they only made up 67 percent of the population. That’s not a problem caused by a few bad actors. It’s always easier to blame the individual police officer for brutality than the structure that created him, which is what O’Brien did in another interview Sunday with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. He called for the Minneapolis police officers who stood by and watched their colleague kill George Floyd to be prosecuted, suggesting that their inaction showed “a lack of humanity.” “It’s an absolute outrage … I can’t imagine that they won’t be charged,” White House adviser Robert O’Brien says when asked about officers who watched George Floyd get killed. “To have stood by and allowed that to happen … it shows a lack of humanity.”  pic.twitter.com/Jpf2hITpZF — ABC News (@ABC) May 31, 2020 Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Last week’s budget bill was hurried through before anyone really had a chance to read the hundreds of riders and amendments that got tacked onto it. This was a very deliberate decision. John Boehner may have said that he wished Congress had more time to review the bill, but he knew perfectly well that the main reason for the rush was the fact that the House passed a 3-day continuing resolution after the final text was first posted. There were only three days to look at the bill because that’s what the Republican leadership wanted. This means that we’ll be discovering cute little buried acorns in this bill for a while, and today Patrick Caldwell digs one up: One small section could upend the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to regulate political organizations hoping to become nonprofits. Tacked on as a symbolic effort to mollify conservatives’ anti-IRS mania, the text is so overly vague that it could mean the dissolution of longstanding rules. Or nothing at all. No one’s really sure. ….The relevant section is buried on page 439 of the gigantic bill. Just nine lines long and 68 words, the two clauses say money designated for the IRS cannot be used to “target citizens of the United States for exercising any right guaranteed under the first Amendment” or to target “groups for regulatory scrutiny based on their ideological beliefs.” ….All of the tax experts reached by Mother Jones were mystified by the use of the word “target,” an unusual term to be applied to the IRS. “I’m not even sure what targeting means,” says Owens. This is obviously a sop to tea partiers, who continue to be obsessed by the idea that the IRS “targeted” them unfairly in 2010. The real scandal, of course, wasn’t the fact that tea party groups got some scrutiny, but the fact that more groups don’t get scrutiny. The law pretty clearly limits the tax exemption of groups that are directly engaged in political activity, and it ought to be applied to far more groups than it is now. That includes tea party groups, virtually all of which were created specifically to engage in political activity. But now that law is in conflict with a hastily written provision that forbids “targeting” any groups for engaging in free speech. If courts interpret that as forbidding the IRS from going after groups engaged in political advocacy, it could upend campaign finance law in the United States. Or maybe not. But you can rest assured that this will be coming to a court near you sometime soon. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "<a  Shankbone</a>/Wikimedia Commons In New York, unionized staffers at the Village Voice say they will strike if management doesn’t address their demands for better health and retirement plans by tomorrow, when their current contract expires. The Voice—the nation’s oldest and largest alt-weekly newspaper—is among a handful of media outlets left with union representation. The paper renegotiates its contract with the United Auto Workers (which also reps Mother Jones) every three years, but while staffers have a history of threatening strikes they have never actually gone on one. Since the last negotiation, a joint press release from the UAW and Pulitzer-finalist Voice reporter Graham Rayman says, “staff has been cut by an estimated 60%, and average annual salaries have markedly diminished.” The statement is published on TheRealVoice.org, where staffers say they plan to continue writing in the event of a strike. Of course, staff and pay cuts are pretty standard fare in the news biz these days (Washington Post media blogger Erik Wemple takes the union to task over this). But Voice management has forced out a notable host of acclaimed journalists in recent years. Since its acquisition by Phoenix-based New Times Media (now Village Voice Media) in 2006, the paper’s lost scribes have included music critic Robert Christgau, reporter James Ridgeway (who’s now with Mother Jones), and political reporters Wayne Barrett and Tom Robbins.* Over at FishbowlLA, former LA Weekly reporter Steven Mikulan analyzes the situation. Mikulan has some experience in these matters, as he used to work for Village Voice Media’s unionized publication LA Weekly, until it let him go in 2009. From Mikulan: Neither the LA Weekly nor the Voice‘s union locals have the right to strike—until after their contracts expire and there’s no sign of a new collective bargaining agreement. (Likewise, management can’t lock out the union—until the contract expires, etc.) That’s the way most contracts are—to walk out while a contract’s in force is to engage in a wildcat strike… It’s not surprising that medical benefits are at the heart of the holdup. In 2008 the Voice’s union dodged the bullet of having to contribute to its health care plans, probably because the ownership changeover had just happened and the new, highly unpopular owners had a lot more to worry about than getting bogged down in contract talks. “Nothing that’s happened so far is any different than in previous years, and I expect that on or before June 30 we will end up with a new contract that is approved by both sides,” Voice editor-in-chief Tony Ortega told Gothamist. But the Village Voice has undergone a lot of changes in recent years (to say nothing of its drift away from its Norman Mailer/Greenwich Village origins), not all for the better, and it will be interesting to see how the paper’s next chapter unfolds. *Full disclosure: I interned with Barrett last summer before he left the Voice.

        "articles": "<a  Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-described socialist, is an extremely long shot to defeat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary. Does that mean his views on key political issues are too radical for America’s voters? Not necessarily. Here’s how his policy positions actually fare in the polls: Sanders: Describes himself as a democratic socialist. His fellow Americans: While only 31 percent of Americans react positively to the word “socialism,” just 50 percent view “capitalism” in favorable terms, according to a recent Pew survey. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, nearly half had a positive view of “socialism,” while only 47 percent viewed “capitalism” favorably. Sanders: Famously filibustered the 2010 extension of Bush tax cuts for wealthy Americans. His fellow Americans: In a February poll, 68 percent of likely voters said wealthy households pay too little in federal taxes. estate taxes Sanders: Introduced the Responsible Estate Tax Act last year. If passed, it would raise top estate tax rates and expand the tax to include estates worth more than $3.5 million. (It currently only applies to those worth more than $5.4 million, which covers only 0.2 percent of American estates.) His fellow Americans: Results vary, but Kevin Drum notes that the estate tax (conservatives call it the “death tax”) is generally unpopular. Offshore tax havens Sanders: Introduced legislation that would crack down on offshore tax havens by requiring American companies to pay the top corporate tax rate on profits held abroad. His fellow Americans: Eighty-five percent of small business owners favor closing overseas tax loopholes entirely, while 68 percent of Americans believe “we should close tax loopholes for large corporations that ship jobs offshore.” Campaign finance reform Sanders: Advocates a constitutional amendment that would effectively prevent corporations from making political donations. Supports public funding of elections. His fellow Americans: Most Americans believe that corporations should have at least some limited right to make political donations. Even so, in a 2013 Gallup poll, half of the respondents said they would personally vote for banning all political donations from individuals and private groups and shifting to a government-funded campaign finance system. Only 44 percent would oppose such a law. Climate change Sanders: Cosponsored the 2013 Climate Protection Act, which would tax carbon and methane emissions and rebate three-fifths of the revenue to citizens. His fellow Americans: Sixty-four percent of Americans strongly or somewhat favor regulating greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, factories and cars, and requiring utilities to generate more power from low-carbon sources. However, only 34 percent of Americans support a carbon tax with a $500 rebate. Health Care Sanders: Advocates for a single-payer health care system. His fellow Americans: A January 2015 poll found that just over 50 percent of likely voters support single-payer. regulating wall street Sanders: The big banks “are too powerful to be reformed,” Sanders says on his website. “They must be broken up.” His fellow Americans: A recent poll by the Progressive Change Institute found that 58 percent of likely voters support “breaking up big banks like Citigroup.” Sanders: Introduced legislation this month to make public college tuition free in the United States. His fellow Americans: Sixty-three percent of likely voters support President Obama’s proposal to offer qualifying students two free years of community college. No recent polls have tested support for offering free tuition at four-year colleges and universities. trade Sanders: Opposes the Trans Pacific Partnership and similar trade deals. His fellow Americans: Sixty-two percent of voters oppose fast-track authority for the TPP trade deal, but fewer Americans oppose the agreement itself. A 2014 Pew poll put support for the TPP among Americans at 55 percent. Pay equity for women Sanders: Supports a federal law mandating equal pay for equal work. His fellow Americans: Most Americans agree that women face pay discrimination, but only about one-third favor addressing the problem via legislation. Wages Sanders: Supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour “over the next few years.” His fellow Americans: Sixty-three percent of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2020. Unions Sanders: Supports legislation allowing workers to form a union by signing pledge cards. His fellow Americans: A Gallup poll conducted in 2009, when card check legislation was being debated in Congress, found that 53 percent of Americans “favor a new law that would make it easier for labor unions to organize workers.” Social Services Sanders: “Instead of cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and nutrition programs,” Sanders writes on his website, “we should be expanding these programs.” His fellow Americans: Some polls have found that majorities of voters want to expand Social Security. A poll conducted last year showed that even voters in red states want to expand Medicaid.

        "articles": "Ed Kilgore highlights what must be the dumbest, whiniest, most ineffectual “protest” ever. Ladies and gentlemen, the Senate Republican caucus: Senate Republicans will stage a more than 30-hour talkathon on the Senate floor to protest Democrats’ triggering of the “nuclear option” last month. The GOP protest, which could extend into the weekend, will throw a wrench in Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s (D-Nev.) hopes of wrapping up legislative business for 2013 as soon as possible. Republicans will delay a final vote on Cornelia Pillard, one of President Obama’s picks for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, until about 1 a.m. Thursday. Then, Senate Republicans will hold the floor throughout the night, speaking out against Reid’s use of the nuclear option. ….“When you blow up the Senate rules, there has to be a consequence,” said a Republican senator. “We’ll stretch this into the weekend if need be,” said the GOP lawmaker. Seriously? They’re going to thunder away to an empty chamber in order to “punish” Democrats by forcing them to the floor at 1 am for a vote? That’ll show them! And then they’re going to thunder some more in order to—what? Delay everyone’s Christmas shopping? Yeesh. Even the most moronic of the tea partiers isn’t going to be impressed by this display of buffoonery. Get a grip, folks.

        "articles": "<a href=\"EndJeb2016.com\">EndJeb2016.com</a> The 2016 Iowa caucuses remain more than a year distant, but conservatives are already using former Republican Florida Gov. Jeb Bush‘s potential presidential candidacy to raise cash—not to support a Bush bid, but to thwart one. Over the weekend, an outfit called the Constitutional Rights PAC blasted out an email promoting the website EndJeb2016.com and soliciting donations. Federal filings show that the PAC is connected to a Beltway lawyer who led one of the most significant money-in-politics Supreme Court cases of the past five years, and to a media firm that’s helped to stoke the Benghazi scandal, the Obamacare repeal campaign, and an effort to rename Washington, DC’s football team the “Washington Tea Party.” The recent EndJeb2016.com email excoriated Bush, the eldest son of George H.W. Bush and brother of George W. Bush, as “a died-in-the-wool establishment Republican and an advocate of big government.” The email asked supporters to sign an online petition calling Bush “anything but a ‘conservative'” and to give between $25 and $5,000 to the PAC. Larry Ward, the PAC’s founder who signed the End Jeb 2016 email solicitation and registered the EndJeb2016.com site, says the group will distribute its petition to members of Congress, the Republican National Committee, and news outlets once it hits 10,000 signatures. (The initial End Jeb blast brought in about 1,500, he says.) But it’s hard to see how the Constitutional Rights PAC, started in 2013, will put even a dent in Bush’s 2016 plans. The PAC’s federal filings show that it has spent the small sum of money it’s raised primarily on consultants, fundraising, and legal fees. In 2013 and 2014, it pulled in $36,282 from small donors and other PACs and devoted most of that haul to paying for direct mail and online fundraising and digital consulting. In other words, the group raised money to be spent on running its website, generating petitions, and—you guessed it—raising more money and gathering up more email addresses. Ward is more than just the founder of Constitutional Rights PAC; he’s also the president of Political Media Inc., a consulting firm that Constitutional Rights PAC paid more than $10,000 in 2013 and ’14. Ward’s firm, according to federal records, has also banked $195,000 raised by a PAC called Special Operations Speaks, which aims to rev up conservative donors about the Benghazi controversy. Asked about what Constitutional Rights PAC had in store for Bush, Ward said its work is “mostly digital advocacy” and that “we intend to do whatever we can (limited budget) to discourage Jeb from running.” He adds that it is “not close to being true” that the End Jeb effort exists to primarily gin up dollars, and that “I started the PAC to run projects I was passionate about.” As evidence of his firm’s impact, Ward points to his work on Gun Appreciation Day, back in January 2013, which, he says, “defeated (yes we are taking credit) gun control legislation.” Meanwhile, the PAC’s lawyer is Dan Backer, a brash right-leaning attorney who helped bring the Supreme Court case McCutcheon vs. Federal Election Commission. Alabama businessman Shaun McCutcheon, a Backer client, had challenged the federal limit on the number of candidates a donor could contribute to during a two-year election cycle. Last April, the Supreme Court sided with Backer and McCutcheon, striking down the so-called aggregate limits on federal-level campaign donations. As a result, donors can in theory now give as much as $3.5 million in a single election cycle by spreading their money around to candidates, political parties, and PACs. Backer tweeted his response to the decision: “FREEEEDOMMMMM!!!!” (When it comes to Constitutional Rights PAC, Backer says his firm provides legal services but isn’t involved in the PAC’s day-to-day activities.) Federal records show that Backer and his firm are also working on another opposition effort targeting a likely 2016 candidate: Hillary Clinton. Stop Hillary PAC, which has mined conservative email lists for donations and addresses, paid Backer’s firm, DB Capitol Strategies, tens of thousands of dollars for legal work in the last two years. There are no signs that End Jeb 2016 has a serious plan to curb Bush’s campaign or that Bush needs to fret about it. Bush has bigger problems now that Mitt Romney, whose donor base and adviser set overlap with Bush’s, is eyeing a third presidential bid. But that’s not going to stop a crew of consultants from fundraising off of conservative unease about Bush.

        "articles": "<a  The latest issue of the Journal of Psychiatric Research includes a scathing critique of a 2009 study it published linking abortion to a variety of mental health problems. Via the New York Times blog Motherlode, the article states that the data the authors of the study relied on doesn’t actually support their “assertions that abortions led to psychopathology.” That 2009 study linked conditions like panic disorder, panic attacks, PTSD, agoraphobia, bipolar disorder, mania, major depression, and alcohol and drug abuse to women who have had abortions. The paper, from lead author Priscilla Coleman of Bowling Green State University, has been touted by anti-abortion groups and deployed to support state laws requiring doctors to warn women of potential health problems before they can have an abortion in places like South Dakota. But the results just don’t hold up, according to a critique from Julia Steinberg, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of California-San Francisco, and Lawrence Finer, the director of domestic research with the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights group. For one thing, they report, the paper failed to factor in whether the women included in the study had exhibited those mental health problems before having an abortion. Steinberg and Finer reevaluated the data Coleman and her colleagues relied on and found that the conclusions in the paper were not supported by the data. “These deficiencies are fundamental analytical errors that were incorrectly presented in the original paper,” they write, “… not a scholarly difference of opinion.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "The second episode of \"Cosmos\" examines evolution, and the interrelatedness of all life on Earth.Fox. If you think the first episode of the new Fox Cosmos series was controversial (with its relatively minor mentions of climate change, evolution, and the Big Bang), Sunday night’s show threw down the gauntlet. Pretty much the entire episode was devoted to the topic of evolution, and the vast profusion of evidence (especially genetic evidence) showing that it is indeed the explanation behind all life on Earth. At one point, host Neil deGrasse Tyson stated it as plainly as you possibly can: “The theory of evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact.” (You can watch the full episode here.) Not surprisingly, those who deny the theory of evolution were not happy with this. Indeed, the science denial crowd hasn’t been happy with Cosmos in general. Here are some principal lines of attack: Denying the Big Bang: In the first episode of Cosmos, titled “Standing Up in the Milky Way,” Tyson dons shades just before witnessing the Big Bang. You know, the start of everything. Some creationists, though, don’t like the Big Bang; at Ken Ham’s Answers in Genesis, a critique of Cosmos asserts that “the big bang model is unable to explain many scientific observations, but this is of course not mentioned.” Alas, this creationist critique seems very poorly timed: A major new scientific discovery, just described in detail in the New York Times, has now provided “smoking gun” evidence for “inflation,” a crucial component of our understanding of the stunning happenings just after the Big Bang. Using a special telescope to examine the cosmic microwave background radiation (which has been dubbed the “afterglow” of the Big Bang), researchers at the South Pole detected “direct evidence” of the previously theoretical gravitational waves that are believed to have originated in the Big Bang and caused an incredibly sudden and dramatic inflation of the universe. (For an easy to digest discussion, Phil Plait has more.) Denying evolution: Sunday’s episode of Cosmos was all about evolution. It closely followed the rhetorical strategy of Charles Darwin’s world-changing 1859 book, On the Origin of Species, beginning with an example of “artificial selection” by breeders (Darwin used pigeons, Cosmos used domestic dogs) to get us ready to appreciate the far vaster power of natural selection. It employed Darwin’s favorite metaphor: the “tree of life,” an analogy that helps us see how all organisms are living on different branches of the same hereditary tree. In the episode, Tyson also refuted one of the creationist’s favorite canards: the idea that complex organs, like the eye, could not have been produced through evolution. Over at the pro-“intelligent design” Discovery Institute, they’re not happy. Senior fellow David Klinghoffer writes that the latest Cosmos episode “[extrapolated] shamelessly, promiscuously from artificial selection (dogs from wolves) to minor stuff like the color of a polar bear’s fur to the development of the human eye.” In a much more elaborate attempted takedown, meanwhile, the institute’s Casey Luskin accuses Tyson and Cosmos of engaging in “attempts to persuade people of both evolutionary scientific views and larger materialistic evolutionary beliefs, not just by the force of the evidence, but by rhetoric and emotion, and especially by leaving out important contrary arguments and evidence.” Luskin goes on to contend that there is something wrong with the idea of the “tree of life.” Tell that to the scientists involved in the Open Tree of Life project, which plans to produce “the first online, comprehensive first-draft tree of all 1.8 million named species, accessible to both the public and scientific communities.” Precisely how to reconstruct every last evolutionary relationship may still be an open scientific question, but the idea of common ancestry, the core of evolution (represented conceptually by a tree of life), is not. Denying climate change: Thus far, Cosmos has referred to climate change in each of its two opening episodes, but has not gone into any depth on the matter. Perhaps that’s for a later episode. But in the meantime, it seems some conservatives are already bashing Tyson as a global warming proponent. Writing at the Media Research Center’s Newsbusters blog, Jeffrey Meyer critiques a recent Tyson appearance on Late Night With Seth Myers. “Meyers and deGrasse Tyson chose to take a cheap shot at religious people and claim they don’t believe in science i.e. liberal causes like global warming,” writes Meyer. Actually, as Tyson explained on our Inquiring Minds podcast, Cosmos is certainly not anti-religion. As for characterizing global warming as simply a “liberal cause”: In a now famous study finding that 97 percent of scientific studies (that bother to take a position on the matter) agree with the idea of human-caused global warming, researchers reviewed 12,000 scientific abstracts published between the years 1991 and 2011. In other words, this is a field in which a very large volume of science is being published. That hardly sounds like an advocacy endeavor. On our most recent episode of the Inquiring Minds podcast, Tyson explains why he doesn’t debate science deniers; you can listen here (interview starts around minute 13): Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Olivier Douliery/CNP via ZUMA The latest thing for the caterwauling classes to caterwaul about is Hillary Clinton’s recent interview with ReCode. Basically, she said that the big reasons she lost the election were Russia, the Comey letter, and the media’s infatuation with her email server. Everyone is outraged that she refuses to admit that she herself made gigantic mistakes that led to her loss. Bah. Let’s run the tape: So she’s right. I guess everyone wants her to be the captain going down with her ship, but that’s stupid. She accurately described why she lost. Why shouldn’t she? But still, what about all the stuff she screwed up? There wasn’t that much, really, but sure, there are a few things: But look: no candidate is perfect and every campaign has stuff like that. It comes with the territory. And despite all that, Clinton had a comfortable 7-point lead by the end of September. Those things couldn’t have been the reason for her loss since they were all well known by then. After that, she crushed Trump in all three debates and was all set to win. So why didn’t she? The answer is pretty simple: despite running a pretty good campaign, she got walloped by things that decidedly don’t come with the territory: Russian interference via the WikiLeaks drip; an indefensible letter released by the FBI director; and a press corps that treated the Comey letter like the OJ trial. She got slammed late in the game, and had no time to recover. That’s just what happened. Denying that reality because we like losers to wear hair shirts is dumb. Now, there is one thing I’m still curious about: did her data analytics team blow it in the (now) infamous states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania? In most recent campaigns, there’s at least one embedded reporter who promises to embargo everything until after the election, and then gives us the inside dope when it’s all over. But I guess Clinton didn’t allow that, so we don’t really have an inside view. Supposedly, though, internal polling is far more accurate than the stuff we plebs see, and it should have alerted her that something was going on in her firewall states. Did the analytics fail? Or did they work just fine, but she ignored them? To this day, does anyone know? Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

That, in essence, is what the peer review process is for.  — Stephen Stirling (@SStirling) January 25, 2017 “We’re taking a look at everything on a case-by-case basis, including the web page and whether climate stuff will be taken down,” said Doug Ericksen, the communications director for the EPA transition team, in an interview with the AP. “Obviously with a new administration coming in, the transition time, we’ll be taking a look at the web pages and the Facebook pages and everything else involved here at EPA.” Former EPA employees reportedly told the AP that the Trump administration’s rules “far exceed” those imposed by previous administrations: George Gray, the assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Research and Development during the Republican administration of President George W. Bush, said scientific studies were reviewed usually at lower levels and even when they were reviewed at higher levels, it was to give officials notice about the studies—not for editing of content. “Scientific studies would be reviewed at the level of a branch or a division or laboratory,” said Gray, now professor of public health at George Washington University. “Occasionally things that were known to be controversial would come up to me as assistant administrator and I was a political appointee. Nothing in my experience would go further than that.” The EPA’s scientific integrity policy, which was created under former President Barack Obama, mandates that research and actions be “grounded, at a most fundamental level, in sound, high quality science” that is “free from political interference or personal motivations.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "This past weekend, the Department of Justice slapped a record fine on JPMorgan Chase for packaging and selling the mortgage-backed financial products that helped cause the financial meltdown. But Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wants the administration to know that fines are not enough. On Wednesday, she called on Wall Street regulators to hold all those responsible for the 2008 crisis accountable. In a letter to the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Officer of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Warren lauded the overseer of the TARP bailout program for cracking down on financial industry players who wasted, stole, or abused the federal emergency funds doled out to banks during the financial crisis, and implied that the three banking regulators should also punish individuals who helped cause the financial meltdown. Although the budget for TARP’s inspector general was “a small fraction of the size of the budgets and staffs at your agencies,” Warren pointed out, the program’s watchdog has brought criminal charges against nearly 100 senior executives; obtained criminal convictions on 107 defendants, including 51 jail sentences; and suspended or banned 37 people from working in the banking industry. How about you guys, Warren asked. She called on the Fed, the SEC, and the OCC to provide records on the number of people the agencies have charged criminally and civilly, the number of convictions and prison sentences they have obtained, the number of people banned or suspended from working in the industry, and the total amount of fines leveled against Wall Street ne’er-do-wells. Warren knows the answer to most of these questions, but wants to shame the agencies into action. Yes, big banks have been forking over billions of dollars in civil settlements for bad behavior in the lead up to the crisis. There have been prosecutions of various smaller mortgage brokers, and some civil charges and settlements against executives who helped cause the crisis. But zero Wall Street CEOs are in jail for bringing down the economy, and no CEOs have faced criminal charges. Earlier this year, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder seemed to concede that some banks are “too big to jail.” But Warren doesn’t buy it. “There have been some landmark settlements in recent weeks for which your agencies and others deserve substantial credit,” Warren said in the letter. “However, a great deal of work remains to be done to hold institutions and individuals accountable for breaking the rules and to protect consumers and taxpayers from future violations.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "<a  Skidmore</a>/Wikimedia; Hustler The Communications Decency Act of 1996 is not a subject that Newt Gingrich likes to talk about on the campaign trail. For the new GOP front-runner, the episode also marks a notable exception to his record as a social conservative: the time when Gingrich took on his own base to keep the web open for pornography. Here’s how it happened. With a few exceptions, the web was something of a foreign concept to Congress in 1995. (Gingrich, the lower chamber’s biggest web booster, didn’t even use email.) But the internet was quickly earning a reputation, especially on the right, as a den of immorality, awash in smut and sexual predators. Congressional leaders decided they needed the Communications Decency Act, which was folded into a must-pass Telecommunications bill. “Barbarian pornographers are at the gate and they are using the internet to gain access to the youth of America,” warned Sen. Jim Exon (D-Neb.). To fend off the barbarians, Exon introduced an amendment to the Communications Decency Act criminalizing the transmission of “indecent” materials over the internet. In case any stone remained unturned, it went after internet service providers as well: Email or distribute nude photos—or even just type one of the “seven words you can’t say on television”—and you could face a $100,000 fine or up to two years in prison. To illustrate the danger of internet porn, Exon compiled an album of graphic images he’d found on the web—including one of a man engaging in intercourse with a German shepherd—in a blue binder with a red “caution” sticker, and invited his colleagues to take a look. Exon’s measure passed the Senate with 86 votes. The appeal was clear: No elected official wanted to be seen as voting for smut. The Contract With America—Republicans’ promise to voters in advance of their landslide win in the 1994 elections—had even contained a provision vowing to crack down on child pornography. That’s where Gingrich came in. To the House speaker, the debate presented a clash between his desire to prepare America for the 21st century and his conservative values. Gingrich, by his own description, was a “conservative futurist.” He envisioned honeymoons in space and laptops in every classroom; the Exon amendment, by casting such a wide net, threatened that future. Newt’s preferred web-surfing policy: Don’t ask, don’t tell. Newt Gingrich/FacebookGingrich was right that Exon’s bill was extremely broad. As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) pointed out in a particularly inspired floor speech, the law could even have criminalized the online distribution of Gingrich’s first novel, 1945, in which a “pouting sex kitten”—who is also a Nazi—seduces a White House aide in order to extract classified information. It would also have prohibited most non-Will Smith forms of hip-hop. “[The amendment] is clearly a violation of free speech and it’s a violation of the right of adults to communicate with each other,” Gingrich said at the time. “I don’t agree with it…” In an interview with British journalist David Frost, he elaborated on his position. “I think there you have a perfect right on a noncensorship basis to intervene decisively against somebody who would prey upon children. And that I would support very intensely. It’s very different than trying to censor willing adults.” With Gingrich’s support, Rep. Chris Cox (R-Calif.) and Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) crafted an alternative proposal that eschewed punitive measures for online wardrobe malfunctions and expletives, and instead emphasized private, parental education initiatives. The bill passed the House overwhelmingly. Although the Senate’s version was part of the law that eventually passed, it was overturned by the Supreme Court the next year in Reno v. ACLU. What remained was Gingrich’s language, a piece of legislation sufficiently ahead of its time that Jerry Berman, founder of the Center for Democracy and Technology, says it should be called the “Communications Democracy Act.” Gingrich’s support for a hands-off approach set a precedent. Under his watch, the federal government opted against creating the equivalent of an FCC for the internet, helping it grow into what it is today. According to a report published last year by the IT security company Optenet, 37 percent of the internet consists of porn. It also wasn’t the last time that Gingrich stood up for the internet’s biggest business: In 2009, his organization, American Solutions for Winning the Future, briefly named adult-film titan Pink Visual the “entrepreneur of the year” and invited the company’s CEO to a reception at DC’s Capitol Hill Club. Gingrich’s spokesman said at the time that Pink Visual had been honored “inadvertently.” The speaker may have been an ally in the fight against the Exon amendment, but that hardly makes him a free speech icon. Gingrich “talked out both sides of his mouth,” says Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt. The free-speech activist (who currently has a $1 million reward for dirt on Rick Perry’s sex life) took on Gingrich at length in his book Sex, Lies, & Politics and hasn’t changed his views in the ensuing decade. “I wouldn’t vote for him for dogcatcher.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Jose Campos/ZUMA New York wants to get serious about solar power. The state has a goal to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and it’s already among the nation’s solar leaders. New York ranks ninth overall for total installed solar, and in 2013 alone it added enough to power more than 10,000 homes. While that’s great news for solar companies and environmentalists, it’s a bit of a problem for electric utilities. Until recently, the business model of electric companies hadn’t changed much since it was created a century ago. (The country’s first electric grid was strung up by Thomas Edison in Manhattan’s Lower East Side in the 1880s, and some parts of it continued to operate into the 2000s.) Utilities have depended on a steady growth in demand to stay ahead of the massive investments required to build power plants and the electric grid. But now, that tradition is crumbling—thanks to the crazy growth of rooftop solar and other alternative energy sources and some big advances in energy efficiency that have caused the overall demand for electricity to stop growing. Meanwhile, utilities in New York are also required to buy the excess power from solar buildings that produce more than they need—a policy called “net metering”. But here’s the thing: Even the most ardent climate hawks agree that we can’t afford for utilities to go out of business altogether. Someone needs to maintain and manage the grid. Hardly any solar homes are actually “off the grid,” since they still depend on power lines to soak up their excess electricity during sunny afternoons and deliver power at night. In fact, net metering is a key factor in making solar economically viable to homeowners. The question of how to aggressively slash carbon emissions without completely undermining the power sector (and simultaneously raising the risk of blackouts and skyrocketing electric bills) is one of the big existential questions that climate-savvy lawmakers are now trying to figure out. And last week in New York, they took a huge step forward. Under a new order from the state’s Public Service Commission, utility companies will soon be barred from owning “distributed” power systems—that means rooftop solar, small wind turbines, and basically anything else that isn’t a big power plant. (There are some rare exceptions built into the order, notably for giant low-income apartment buildings in New York City that small solar companies aren’t well-equipped to serve.) “By restricting utilities from owning local power generation and other energy resources, customers will benefit from a more competitive market, with utilities working and partnering with other companies and service providers,” the commission said in a statement. The move is part of a larger package of energy reforms in the state, aimed at setting up the kind of futuristic power system that experts think will be needed to combat global warming. The first step came in 2007, when the state adopted “decoupling,” a market design in which a utility’s revenue is based not on how much power it sells, but on how many customers it serves. (Remember that in most states utilities have their income stream heavily regulated by the state in exchange for having a monopoly.) That change removed the incentive for utilities to actively block rooftop solar and energy-saving technology, because lost sales no longer translate to lost income. But because utilities could still make money by recouping the cost of big infrastructure projects through increases to their customers’ bills, they had an incentive to build expensive stuff like power plants and big transmission hubs even if demand could be better met with efficiency and renewables. Now, under New York’s most recent reform, a utility’s revenue will instead be based on how efficiently and effectively it distributes power, so-called “performance-based rates.” This, finally, provides the incentive utilities need to make decisions that jibe with the state’s climate goals, because it will be to their advantage to make use of distributed energy systems. But there’s a catch, one that had clean energy advocates in the state worried. If utilities were allowed to buy their own solar systems, they would be able to leverage their government-granted monopoly to muscle-out smaller companies. This could limit consumer options, drive up prices, and stifle innovation. That, in turn, could put a freeze on consumers’ interest in solar and ultimately slow down the rate at which it is adopted. But if small companies are allowed in, then the energy market starts to look more like markets for normal goods, where customer choice drives technological advances and pushes down prices. “New York’s approach to limit utility ownership balances the desire for more solar with the desire to have competitive markets that we expect to continue to bring down the costs of solar,” said Anne Reynolds, director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York. The upshot is that solar in New York will be allowed to thrive without being squeezed out by incumbent giants like Con Edison and National Grid. “This is as exciting as the Public Service Commission gets,” said Raya Salter, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York who worked with state regulators on the plan. “These are bold, aggressive changes.” The policy puts New York on track for a new way of doing business that many energy wonks now see as inevitable. In the past, the role of electric utilities was to generate power at a few central hubs and bring it to your house; in the near future, their role will be to facilitate the flow of power between countless independent systems. “We need to plan for a primarily renewable system,” said John Farrell, director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which advocates for breaking up the old utility model as a key solution to climate change. “We want to pay [utilities] for doing things we want, rather than paying for their return on investment for the things they build.” So far, the response from utilities has been receptive; a spokesperson for Con Ed said the company looks forward to developing details for how the order will move forward. The change in New York could become a model for other states, Reynolds said. Regulators in Hawaii are already considering a similar policy. “Everyone is watching to see what’s happening here,” she said. “It’s really a model of what a utility could be in the future.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Andrew Sullivan has a longish cover story in Newsweek arguing that both conservatives and liberals attack Barack Obama in dumb ways. Conservatives are convinced he’s a fire-breathing socialist out to destroy capitalism and appease our foreign enemies at every turn. This is little short of deranged, and Sullivan does a nice job of taking it apart. Likewise, the progressive base convinced itself early on that Obama was a committed leftist and has since excoriated him for selling out now that he’s in office. But I agree with Sullivan: Obama simply never sold himself that way. He was, from Day One, a pragmatic, cautious, mainstream Democrat, and anyone watching the 2008 campaign with both eyes open should have understood that. He may be less liberal than a lot of us would like, but anyone who’s disappointed because he turned out not to be the second coming of FDR was just deluding themselves from the start. But Sullivan loses me here: By misunderstanding Obama’s strategy and temperament and persistence, by grandstanding on one issue after another, by projecting unrealistic fantasies onto a candidate who never pledged a liberal revolution, [liberals] have failed to notice that from the very beginning, Obama was playing a long game. He did this with his own party over health-care reform. He has done it with the Republicans over the debt. He has done it with the Israeli government over stopping the settlements on the West Bank—and with the Iranian regime, by not playing into their hands during the Green Revolution, even as they gunned innocents down in the streets. Nothing in his first term—including the complicated multiyear rollout of universal health care—can be understood if you do not realize that Obama was always planning for eight years, not four. This is sort of a watered-down version of the 11-dimensional chess hosannas that deservedly got a lot of mockery back in the day. But it wasn’t true of Obama then (both his campaign and governing strategies have been fairly straightforward) and it’s not necessary to explain anything now. Why was Obama so conciliatory toward the Republican Party early on? It has nothing to do with long-term strategy. It’s because he needed at least two or three Republican votes in the Senate to pass anything, and if he’d been a fire-breathing partisan from the start he wouldn’t have gotten them. He went down this road partly out of native temperament and partly because he didn’t really have any choice. Why did health care reform take so long? Not because of any clever strategy on Obama’s part. It was because, right or wrong, he made a rational calculation not to repeat Bill Clinton’s mistakes. So instead of pushing a plan of his own, he let Congress take the lead. And Congress decided to move very, very slowly. Why was Obama’s reponse to the financial crisis basically pretty centrist? Again, not because of any long game. More likely, it’s because Obama himself is genuinely fairly centrist and business oriented when it comes to financial policy. What explains Obama’s strategy toward Israel and its West Bank settlements? I’m not even sure what the argument for a long game is here. The more prosaic—and probably correct—explanation is that Obama failed. He tried to press Netanyahu on the settlements because he thought he had the leverage to make him listen. He turned out to be wrong, plain and simple. Why is Obama now taking a harder, more partisan approach toward his GOP adversaries? Not because he was cleverly playing with them for three years and is now reaping the rewards of an electorate convinced that Republicans are hopelessly obstructionist. In fact, surveys don’t suggest that public opinion has moved much in Obama’s direction at all. Rather, he’s doing it because it’s an election year. It’s now time for contrast, not compromise. This is Campaigning 101. There are a few examples where I think Obama has indeed played a deliberately patient game that’s paid off. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell is one: Doing it his way made repeal far less divisive and far more permanent than if he’d tried to hurry it through. Likewise, his policy toward Iran has been deliberately devised to demonstrate that he’s trying his best to be reasonable and is only tightening sanctions as a last resort. This has successfully kept China and Russia from being obstructionist and produced a better, more global sanctions regime than he otherwise would have gotten. But these are the exceptions, not the rule. For the most part, Obama’s actions can be explained without resort to mysterious and ulterior motives. He’s done what he’s done sometimes out of native temperament, sometimes out of straightforward political calculation, sometimes out of plain misjudgment, and sometimes because he genuinely has more centrist views than his critics want to believe. More than with most presidents, I think that with Obama, what you see is what you get. He’s just not that hard a guy to explain.

At the bottom of the list is a case that’s gotten little attention, but one that maybe best highlights his success in fighting discrimination complaints—and why civil rights groups see him as the wrong person to lead the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. From 2003 to 2005, Dreiband served as general counsel of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a government agency with the power to prosecute discrimination in employment. Dreiband has characterized his record at the EEOC as one of “aggressive enforcement,” where he oversaw hundreds of cases and forced companies to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. After leaving government, Dreiband cashed in on his tenure at the EEOC to start working on behalf of companies fighting off discrimination suits brought by his former employer. He defended big corporations against the EEOC, including CVS Pharmacy in a case over its severance agreements and Bloomberg in a pregnancy discrimination case. Most famously, Dreiband was part of a team that defended the retailer Abercrombie & Fitch for refusing to hire a Muslim teen whose headscarf violated the company’s “look” policy. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, where Abercrombie lost. Dreiband also took his expertise to Congress on several occasions, where he urged reforms that would reduce the EEOC’s authority. In 2010, Dreiband was approached by another potential client facing a suit from the EEOC. This time, it wasn’t a private company, but the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, a little-known government agency that issues reports on religious discrimination abroad and makes policy recommendations based on its findings. Since its inception in 1998, critics had alleged that the commission was concerned mainly with anti-Christian discrimination and failed to address discrimination against other religious groups. Leonard Leo, a conservative Catholic, joined the commission in 2007 and became its chairman in 2009. Known as the most important figure in the conservative legal world, Leo is now executive vice president of the Federalist Society, which recommends judicial nominees to Republican presidents. Business Insider recently named him “the most powerful recruiter in the world” for his role in picking conservative Supreme Court justices during the past two Republican administrations. In the spring of 2009, the commission hired a young woman named Safiya Ghori-Ahmad as a staff analyst for the South Asia region. Born in Arkansas, Ghori-Ahmad came to the job with a law degree, a master’s degree, fluency in Hindi and Urdu, and enthusiastic reviews from those who had interviewed her. But after accepting the job, it became clear that her Muslim faith, Indian heritage, and past employment at the Muslim Public Affairs Council, a group that advocates on behalf of American Muslims, were a problem for some of the commissioners. According to a complaint Ghori-Ahmad filed in federal court three years later, several commissioners objected to her hiring. In an internal email, the complaint alleges, commissioner Nina Shea wrote that hiring a Muslim to analyze religious freedom in Pakistan would be like “hiring an IRA activist to research the UK twenty years ago.” Shea denied writing the email. Ultimately, the commission revoked Ghori-Ahmad’s job offer four weeks after extending it. At the time, according to the complaint, the commission’s policy director admitted to Ghori-Ahmad that the decision was due to her Muslim faith. But after an outcry from the commission’s staff, the commissioners voted to give her a three-month temporary contract, during which time she was forbidden to work on matters related to Pakistan. During her temporary stint, Ghori-Ahmad filed a complaint with the EEOC, alleging that the commission had rescinded her employment offer due to religious discrimination. At the end of her temporary contract, the professional staff wrote a joint letter to the commissioners recommending that Ghori-Ahmad once again be offered a staff position. The commissioners declined to hire her. One researcher resigned in protest of Ghori-Ahmad’s treatment. Enter Dreiband. The commission had been represented in the case by the General Services Administration, a federal agency, but in July 2010, Leo announced to the commissioners that Dreiband had been hired to take over, according to a former commissioner who asked not to be named. Dreiband sought to get the case dismissed, arguing that the commission was not subject to the workplace protections in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In other words, a commission established to defend religious liberty had the right to discriminate based on religion. The theory behind his argument was creative, if not exactly baseless. The commission was not an executive agency, he argued. But because Congress had failed to specifically mention that the commission would be subject to congressional rules, it was free from the civil rights laws that govern entities in the legislative branch. In other words, it wasn’t really subject to anyone’s rules. “I think it was a very novel argument at the time to say, ‘We’re neither, and therefore she has no rights,'” says a former Justice Department official who asked not to be identified. “It just kind of belies common sense.” But Dreiband was effective. A few weeks later, the administrative judge dismissed the case. Dreiband had won the battle for his client, but he may have cost it the war. Ghori-Ahmad’s case drew attention on Capitol Hill at the same time that the commission was awaiting reauthorization. When Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) learned about the case, he successfully pushed through reforms that would bring the commission under the nation’s civil rights laws. Moreover, he made sure that the laws applied retroactively, allowing Ghori-Ahmad’s case to go forward. Durbin’s reforms also targeted the commissioners who had fired her by imposing term limits and making them retroactive as well—effectively firing Leo and the rest of the commissioners. In June 2012, Ghori-Ahmad filed a complaint against the commission in federal court, alleging religious discrimination. This time, the Justice Department represented the commission. The case drew attention to the commission, and not in a good way, as a religious freedom commission accused of religious discrimination. Christianity Today described it as “one of the most ironic religious freedom lawsuits ever filed.” In late 2014, the commission agreed to a settlement, which people with knowledge of it have described as very favorable to Ghori-Ahmad. President Donald Trump nominated Dreiband to lead the Civil Rights Division in June. Following Dreiband’s confirmation hearing in September, Durbin submitted several written questions to Dreiband about the case. “Can you explain how you came to represent the Commission, why you decided to take this case, and the rationale for the Commission’s defense?” he asked. “Why did the Commission, a governmental entity, retain private counsel in this case?” Neither Dreiband nor Leo responded to requests for comment. Dreiband responded by reiterating that the commission hadn’t been covered by civil rights laws. He answered none of the other questions.

        "articles": "Rick Scott is making it harder to vote. Flickr/Donkey HoteyThis post has been updated. Score one for Gov. Rick Scott, who is moving ahead with plans to ferret out “noncitizens” on Florida’s voter rolls. The tea party stalwart won a yearlong battle with the Obama administration last weekend when the Department of Homeland Security agreed to let the state check its voter registrations against a federal database of resident aliens in the United States. But along with ongoing efforts to crack down on voters without IDs and keep convicts away from the polls, it looks like a thinly disguised voter suppression tactic that could tip the electoral scales in the crucial battleground state. Scott’s communications director, Brian Burgess, bragged on Saturday that “all of Florida wins!” because of this development. But are noncitizens actually registering to vote in any significant number? Fox News and friends have made it a pet issue as Republicans come to grips with a growing Latino population more likely to vote for the other party—and whose numbers the GOP might be happy to see diminish at the polls. The DHS database that Florida will utilize—known as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE—does not contain a comprehensive list of the estimated 11.5 million people who are in the United States without authorization; rather, it tracks resident aliens who have visas to stay in the US. Here’s how Scott’s plan is supposed to work: Florida will provide a number for each person it suspects of not being a US citizen, and then the feds will check that against SAVE to confirm whether the person is in the US illegally. And then the state will check its voter lists to see if that person is registered to vote. “Access to the SAVE database will ensure that noncitizens do not vote in future Florida elections,” Scott said in a statement following the DHS decision. “We’ve already confirmed that noncitizens have voted in past elections here in Florida.” Scott was referring to an attempt made earlier this year to purge Florida’s voter rolls—but the number of illegitimate voters found was statistically insignificant. Using info from the driver’s license bureau, state officials compiled a list of 182,000 suspicious voters, which was whittled down to 2,600. Of that number, 107—or about 0.001 percent of Florida’s 11.2 million voters—shouldn’t have been registered to vote. It turned out those 107 voters included more registered Republicans than Democrats. Moreover, that state list was also riddled with errors—full of longtime and recently naturalized citizens who were fully eligible to vote. “I hate having these new citizens’ first experience with our process be one that frustrates,” one country elections supervisor complained to a state official about the sweep. Scott’s moves could make a tight presidential contest in Florida even tighter. According to Nate Silver, keeper of the New York Times‘ Five Thirty Eight blog, strict voter ID laws can reduce turnout in an election by about 2 percent. Fishing for noncitizen voters isn’t exactly the same as requiring a state ID at the poll, but it’s in the same ballpark—particularly in a minority- and immigrant-heavy state like Florida. Florida has a new voter ID law, has used sketchy legal tactics to slow the pace of new voter registration drives, and has taken pains to keep convicted felons from registering to vote. Add in the fact that President Obama and Mitt Romney are polling neck-and-neck in the Sunshine State, and you have a recipe for another litigious November in Tallahassee. There’s no word from the governor yet on how much time and money the checks will require, or whether the SAVE database is up-to-date on resident aliens who may have gained citizenship through naturalization. But given that SAVE aims to catch people who overstay their visas, rather than undocumented immigrants, there has been a marked shift in Florida Republicans’ rhetoric, focusing on “noncitizen” voters rather than “illegal” voters. Scott’s voter purge strategy has turned out to be popular among voters, even as he has not. But even if it helps tilt Florida in Romney’s favor, it may not be enough to help Scott get reelected. He is saddled with low approval numbers, a high-profile loss in the Florida-led challenge to Obamacare at the Supreme Court, and a lieutenant governor fighting allegations that she had a lesbian affair with a staffer. “He doesn’t turn even Republican voters on the same way that [former Gov.] Jeb Bush did,” one pollster said of the uncharismatic governor. “There’s just something not there.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "On Thursday, as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified in front of the Republican-led House subcommittee on Benghazi, she spoke about the political nature of the hearing and compared it to what transpired after other terrorist attacks on American facilities overseas. Several hours into the hearing, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) noted that “the ambassador was a friend of yours,” and he wondered “if you would like to comment on what [it] is like to be the subject of an allegation that you deliberately interfered with security that cost the life of a friend.” This was the opportunity for Clinton to begin talking more personally about the deaths of the Americans. “I would imagine that I’ve thought more about what happened than all of you put together,” she said. “I’ve lost more sleep than all of you put together. I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done, and what should have been done.” She went on to compare the current inquiry to those that followed the attacks on Benghazi that killed four Americans, and the 1983 attacks on the US Marine barracks and the US embassy in Beirut, in which nearly 260 American Marines, sailors, and soldiers were killed. She pointed out that the level of political vitriol flying back and forth today was not in evidence then, and opposing political forces worked together after major incidents that cost American lives. I would like us to get back to those times, congressman. Whereas I think one of you said [that in] Beirut we lost far more Americans, not once, but twice within a year. There was no partisan effort. People rose above politics. A Democratic Congress worked with a Republican administration to say, “What do we need to learn?” Out of that came the legislation for the Accountability Review Board. Similarly, after we lost more Americans in the bombings in east Africa, again, Republicans and Democrats worked together and said, “What do we need to do better?” She then described herself “an optimist…hoping that that will be the outcome of this and every other effort, so that we really do honor not only those that we lost, but all those who, right as we speak, are serving in dangerous places representing the values and interests of the American people.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton share a laugh at Secretary of State John Kerry's confirmation hearing.J. Scott Applewhite Hillary Clinton desperately wants liberals to redirect their adoration of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) toward her presidential campaign. Since the official launch of her 2016 run earlier this month, Clinton has done everything she can to cozy up to Warren and publicly channel the spirit of the Massachusetts senator. Clinton has bemoaned hedge funders paying lower tax rates and called out CEOs for earning outsize paychecks. She penned a fawning blurb about Warren for Time‘s list of the world’s 100 most influential people. “Elizabeth Warren never lets us forget that the work of taming Wall Street’s irresponsible risk taking and reforming our financial system is far from finished,” Clinton wrote. “And she never hesitates to hold powerful people’s feet to the fire: bankers, lobbyists, senior government officials and, yes, even presidential aspirants.” Beyond this broad political rhetoric, Clinton so far has been unwilling to reveal where exactly her views align with Warren’s. She launched her campaign by traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire for a “listening tour” of sorts, with detailed ideas promised to come later in the year. A spokesman for the Clinton campaign declined to say if Hillary Clinton would support a list of specific ideas proposed by Warren, such as breaking up big banks and imposing new taxes on financial transactions. “As Hillary Clinton said last week, Elizabeth Warren is a champion of working families and scourge of special interests,” Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said in a statement to Mother Jones. “The campaign is only two weeks old and we will be detailing our policy agenda after our ramp up period ends this summer but Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton share a record of and a commitment to fighting for everyday Americans and their families.” One of the many reasons that the progressive base has come to adore Warren (and has encouraged her to run for president) is that she not only rails against the excesses of Wall Street, but also forcefully offers specific ideas on how to fix the problem. Take the speech she gave last week at an economics conference in New York. Warren laid out a sweeping argument of how Depression-era reforms had been whittled away by the deregulatory zeal that started during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, carried on under Bill Clinton, and set the stage for the Wall Street meltdown that sent the economy into a tailspin in 2008. “Without some basic rules and accountability, financial markets don’t work,” Warren said. “People get ripped off, risk-taking explodes, and the markets blow up. That’s just an empirical fact.” From there, Warren wonked out, offering a wide-ranging list of ideas about how the government could build on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 law that put new limits on Wall Street. Mother Jones sent a detailed list of these policy proposals to the Clinton campaign for comment, but it declined to weigh in on any specifics. Among Warren’s suggestions: Warren directly called out her Republican colleagues in Congress who have voted to erase financial regulations and defund watchdog agencies. But her criticism just as easily could have been directed at the current front-runner for the Democratic nomination. When the economy started to slip during her 2008 presidential primary campaign, Clinton proposed modest stimulus measures and plans to help homeowners facing foreclosure. But by then serving as Obama’s secretary of state, Clinton sidestepped domestic politics for four years, never having to offer an opinion on questions like whether Dodd-Frank went far enough. In January, Clinton tweeted her support for Dodd-Frank as Republicans in Congress voted to strip away some of its key rules. But she hasn’t said anything beyond the 140-character limit. Warren has been skeptical of Clinton’s views on financial regulation for quite some time. In an appearance with Bill Moyers in 2004, Warren told a story about how, as first lady, Clinton had opposed a bankruptcy reform measure that favored the banks over consumers, only to turn around and vote for the bill when she later became a senator from New York. “She has taken money from [Wall Street] groups, and more to the point, she worries about them as a constituency,” Warren said. Warren and Clinton met in December at Clinton’s house in Washington, DC. Clinton reportedly asked for Warren’s advice but not her endorsement. Earlier this week, the New York Times ran a story filled with Clinton allies bemoaning the attention Warren receives for being a liberal hero, pointing to Clinton’s long record of championing populist causes. In the past, Clinton has taken progressive stances on income inequality, raising taxes on the wealthy, and supporting early childhood education. But Warren’s fans aren’t likely to feel fully comfortable with Clinton until she offers some specifics on the financial reform topics that have made Warren famous.

        "articles": "Brandon Marshall/REX/AP A few weeks ago, Hillary Clinton delivered a much-touted policy speech at the New America Foundation in Washington, where she talked passionately about the financial plight of Americans who “are still barely getting by, barely holding on, not seeing the rewards that they believe their hard work should have merited.” She bemoaned the fact that the slice of the nation’s wealth collected by the top 1 percent—or 0.01 percent—has “risen sharply over the last generation,” and she denounced this “throwback to the Gilded Age of the robber barons.” Her speech, in which she cited the various projects of the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation that address economic inequality, was widely compared to the rhetoric of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the unofficial torchbearer of the populist wing of the Democratic Party. Here was Hillary, test-driving a theme for a possible 2016 presidential campaign, sticking up for the little guy and trash-talking the economic elites. She decried the “shadow banking system that operated without accountability” and caused the financial crisis that wiped out millions of jobs and the nest eggs, retirement funds, and college savings of families across the land. Yet at the end of this week, when all three Clintons hold a daylong confab with donors to their foundation, the site for this gathering will be the Manhattan headquarters of Goldman Sachs. Goldman was a key participant in that “shadow banking system” that precipitated the housing market collapse and the consequent financial debacle that slammed America’s middle class. (A system that was unleashed in part due to deregulation supported by the Clinton administration in the 1990s.) This investment house might even be considered one of the robber barons of Wall Street. In its 2011 report, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a congressionally created panel set up to investigate the economic meltdown, approvingly cited a financial expert who concluded that Goldman practices had “multiplied the effects of the collapse in [the] subprime” mortgage market that set off the wider financial implosion that nearly threw the nation into a depression. Hillary Clinton’s shift from declaimer of Big Finance shenanigans to collaborator with Goldman—the firm has donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation—prompts an obvious question: Can the former secretary of state cultivate populist cred while hobnobbing with Goldman and pocketing money from it and other Wall Street firms? Last year, she gave two paid speeches to Goldman Sachs audiences. (Her customary fee is $200,000 a speech.) In recent years, Goldman Sachs has hardly exemplified the values and principles Clinton earnestly hailed in her speech. A few reminders: Given Hillary Clinton’s Warrenesque address at the New America Foundation, I asked a spokesmen for the potential 2016 candidate if there was anything incongruous about her association with Goldman, and he forwarded this statement: The support the Clinton Foundation receives from companies such as Goldman Sachs, organizations and individual donors helps maximize the impact of our philanthropic work. This support is helping enterprise partnerships in South America that are creating jobs; efforts to improve access to early childhood education in the U.S.; development programs that help small holder farmers in Africa; and rebuilding and economic development efforts in Haiti. Goldman Sachs has been a long time supporter of the Clinton Global Initiative where they have advanced a commitment designed to support 10,000 women across the world through business training and education. We are grateful for their support. A longtime Hillary Clinton adviser said, “She’s not giving any more speeches to Goldman Sachs.” Clinton’s relationship with Goldman Sachs is not unique. Bill and Hillary Clinton have always nurtured cozy ties with Wall Street—in terms of policies and funds-chasing (for their campaigns and the foundation). The chief economic guru of the Clinton administration was Robert Rubin, a former Goldman Sachs chairman, and the financial deregulation and free-trade pacts of the Clinton years have long ticked off their party’s populists. In his new book, former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recalls visiting Bill Clinton at his Harlem office and asking his advice, as Geithner puts it, on “how to navigate the populist waters” and respond to the American public’s anger about bailouts and Wall Street. The former president didn’t seem to have much sympathy for these popular sentiments and replied by referring to the CEO of Goldman: “You could take Lloyd Blankfein into a dark alley and slit his throat, and it would satisfy them for about two days. Then the bloodlust would rise again.” If Hillary does decide to seek a return to the White House, can she straddle the line? Assail the excesses of Wall Street piracy and tout the necessity of economic fair play yet still accept the embrace, generosity, and meeting rooms of Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street players? During her speech, she offered a good summation of populism, remarking “working with my husband and daughter at our foundation, our motto is ‘We’re all in this together,’ which we totally believe.” Yet her association with Goldman might cause some to wonder how firmly she holds this belief—and how serious she is about reining in those robber barons.

        "articles": "Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and Ayanna Presley (D-Mass.).Carol Guzy/Zuma President Donald Trump’s racist comments directed at four congresswomen of color have spawned escalating social media attacks on the group known as the Squad, sometimes advocating violence against the lawmakers. In one episode, a police officer in Louisiana wrote on Facebook that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) should be shot. The officer from Gretna, Louisiana wrote, “This vile idiot needs a round……..and I don’t mean the kind she used to serve,” in response to a fake news post claiming that Ocasio-Cortez believed soldiers were paid too much. In a press conference late Monday, Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson announced that the officer who wrote the post, Charles Rispoli, as well as another officer who liked it, Angelo Varisco, had been fired. “We have a zero-tolerance policy,” Lawson told reporters. “This incident, we feel, has been an embarrassment to our department, that these officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional.” “Alluding to a violent act to be conducted against a sitting US congresswoman, a member of our government, we’re not going to tolerate that.” In another Facebook post, the Illinois Republican County Chairmen’s Association shared an image of Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ayanna Presley (D-Mass.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) labeled “Jihad Squad.” The image spoofs a movie poster for the 2013 film “Gangster Squad.” The post was accompanied by the caption, “Political Jihad is their game. If you don’t agree with their socialist ideology, you’re racist.” This is on the Illinois Republican County Chairmen’s Association’s Facebook site: pic.twitter.com/0qzKsiRzzq — Rick Pearson (@rap30) July 21, 2019 The attacks on the first-term congresswomen came less than a week after Trump stood idly by as his supporters chanted “send her back” in reference to Omar, a naturalized citizen from Somalia. Earlier last week, Trump had suggested that all four congresswomen of color—including those born in the United States—”go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Aric Crabb/ZUMA When Bill Clinton swings by the Machinists Union hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sunday night, he’ll be flanked by a bevy of national labor leaders. It will be a fitting scene for the final night before the first votes of the Democratic presidential nomination contest, a campaign in which Hillary Clinton has wrapped up the vast majority of national union endorsements. She’s received the support of 24 unions, she bragged at an event last week, representing more than 10 million of the 14.6 million unionized workers in the country. Organized labor has been a major push for her campaign as she closes out Iowa. Last week, Hillary Clinton hosted a “Hard Hats for Hillary” event that included the presidents of the Carpenters, Ironworkers, and Federation of Government Employees, among others. She released a gauzy video on her support for unions, in which she tells their members, “A lot of the work you do may not be as well understood and appreciated as it should be.” On the ground here in Iowa, however, Clinton’s labor advantage isn’t quite so clear-cut. There aren’t polls measuring statewide union support for the two candidates, and it’s notoriously difficult to forecast caucus results anyway, given how much they come down to turnout and organization. But mounting anecdotal evidence from Iowa suggests that notwithstanding the endorsements of the people atop the unions, Clinton might not be able to count on the same level of support from actual union members in Monday’s caucuses. “I know there’s a lot of rank-and-file people that like Bernie Sanders,” says Ken Sager, president of the Iowa AFL-CIO. Sager, a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which has yet to endorse, says he’s been getting about equal volumes of pro-Sanders and pro-Clinton mail—about seven pieces of mail per day from the campaigns and various unions in the final days of the race—despite the fact that his wife is a member of the pro-Clinton AFSCME. “The people that I have talked to think that he is very genuine in terms of supporting the issues that are important to workers and their families,” Sager says, noting that other local chapters of the electrical union in other parts of the country have endorsed Sanders. “He talks about the things that will work in making a difference. Getting everybody to be involved.” Lance Coles, the communications director for the state’s AFL-CIO, predicts that ample union support could propel Sanders to a statewide victory on Monday. “I’ve said that for a long time,” he says. “I think Bernie’s going to squeak it out here, I think he’s going to pull it.” Coles’ union, the American Postal Workers Union, has endorsed Sanders, and he’s been active in boosting Sanders’ efforts. “Come Monday night, there’s going to be a lot of Bernie support,” he says. “Probably a lot more than what people think.” “The Bernie [events] are like pep rallies,” he adds. “They’re much more, I don’t want to say agitated, but excited, there’s a lot more energy in their events. Most of the stuff I see for Hillary is: one, she’s always late, which pisses a lot of people off. And I understand that with Secret Service, I get it, I understand that. But a lot of people are really frustrated with that.” Last fall, when Clinton skipped the state’s AFL-CIO convention while Sanders and other candidates attended, local labor leaders groused to Bloomberg Businessweek‘s Josh Eidelson that they were wary of Clinton, primarily over her shifting positions on free trade. “I would love to have her be the first female president,” Stacey Andersen, a representative of the Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics & Allied Workers International Union, told Eidelson, “but she’s going to have to come out a little bit stronger than what I’ve been seeing when it comes to labor-friendly issues.” And as the Intercept recently noted, Clinton’s union endorsements have been the decisions of the group’s leadership, while the handful of unions backing Sanders have done so after directly polling their members. On Monday afternoon, Sanders appeared at the local hall of the United Steelworkers in Des Moines (showing up on time) to assure the crowd—whose national union has yet to endorse—that he’s the better candidate for organized labor. Parked outside was a red campaign bus from the National Nurses United emblazoned with an endorsement for Sanders. “The most trusted profession trusts Bernie,” the side of the bus read. The Sanders staff distributed signs to the crowd reading, “Vote Labor Values, Labor for Bernie.” “I like his views and his opinions,” Josh Fleenor, a 35-year-old tire builder in the local union, told me before the event. “Bring America back.” Throughout his speech, Sanders touted his record of fighting for low-wage workers, defending efforts to block trade agreements—a veiled dig at Clinton—and to expand union membership through measures such as card check. “I don’t get any money, and I don’t want any money, from corporations,” he said. “Never got a nickel. Don’t want any money from the billionaire class. But I am very grateful for the support that I’ve received from the Steelworkers throughout my entire political career. Thank you guys very, very much.” “Initially I didn’t think he could win,” said Jerry Addy, a retired operating engineer at the event. “Now I think he can win. I just think Bernie’s a better person, a better candidate. Bernie’s doing retail. Hillary’s doing wholesale.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "After the presidential debate Monday night, Hillary Clinton’s campaign put out a brutal new web video attacking Donald Trump for how he described a former Miss Universe. Near the end of the debate, Clinton blasted Trump for how he had treated Alicia Machado, who won the Miss Universe pageant in 1996, representing Venezuela. (Trump owned the Miss Universe pageant from 1996 until 2015.) “One of the worst things he’s said was about a woman in a beauty contest,” Clinton said. “He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman ‘Miss Piggy.’ Then he called her ‘Miss Housekeeping,’ because she’s Latina.” Trump criticized Machado for gaining weight and invited the media to watch her exercise. In the video, Machado narrates in Spanish, filling in the details of her interactions with Trump. “He was overwhelming,” she says. “I was very scared of him. He’d yell at me all the time.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Donald Trump in 1989Giovanni/Ipol1hotos/Zuma Following weeks of protests against racial injustice in the United States, President Donald Trump is reportedly planning on delivering a speech on race relations. Reportedly, it will be written by his senior aide Stephen Miller, who was responsible for turning the president’s hardline attitudes towards immigration into policy that involves separating families and placing children in cages at the nation’s southern border. It is impossible to predict what this speech will contain, but given his past performance in referring to protesters as “THUGS“, it is unlikely that Trump will offer healing comments in an attempt to bridge divisions in the nation. In case you needed further proof that the president has always been a racist, Mother Jones dug up some of his comments from 1989. “A well-educated Black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market,” Trump told NBC at the time. “If I were starting off today I would love to be a well-educated Black because I really believe they do have an actual advantage today.” Watch the video: In 1989, Donald Trump appeared in an NBC News special on race in the United States. He declared that if he were starting off in business at this point in time, he would “love” to be “a well-educated Black.” Watch: pic.twitter.com/fkNHN7VE1G — Mother Jones (@) June 10, 2020 Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Texas Gov. Rick Perry<a  Perry</a>/Flickr Texas Governor Rick Perry caused a hulabaloo this week when he revealed to the campaign press what Texans have known for a decade: He’s really not that into science. Evolution, he told a 9-year-old New Hampshire boy on Thursday, is just “a theory that’s out there,” which is why, “in Texas, we teach both creationism and evolution in our public schools.” That came just one day after Perry revealed that the world’s climatologist are engaged in a sweeping conspiracy to manipulate data to “keep the money rolling in.” But the GOP presidential candidate, who once appointed a creationist dentist (and fellow Aggie) to head the State Board of Education, has long been a public opponent of evolution, both in his policies and his rhetoric. As he explained last year, “I am a firm believer in intelligent design as a matter of faith and intellect, and I believe it should be presented in schools alongside the theories of evolution.” According to Supreme Court, public schools cannot teach creationism as science, and according to the state’s most curriculum standards they’re not supposed to either—which makes Perry’s statement that Texas schools do teach creationism all the more noteworthy. Over at the Texas Observer, Forrest Wilder recounts the governor’s history of appointing … let’s say “scientifically-disoriented” officials to scientifically-oriented agencies like the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and then offers some personal experience: Regardless of what the official curriculum is, there are teachers in Texas who do teach creationism. I know, because I had a teacher that did so in my Central Texas high school. She proudly displayed a bumper sticker on her podium that read something like, “Big Bang Theory: God Said ‘Bang’ and There it Was.” Her students picked up on her creationist catch-phrases—”Can’t make a chain out of missing links”—and took pity on us in the AP biology class, where evolution was taught as the cornerstone of biology. Maybe this is what Rick Perry meant when he said “we teach both creationism and evolution in our public schools.” Creationism *is* taught occasionally; it’s just that it’s not supposed to be. And then there’s this, from PolitiFact: Penn State University political scientist Eric Plutzer, who helped conduct a 2007 national survey of more than 950 science teachers in 49 states, including Texas, told us in an interview that in any state 10 percent to 20 percent of science teachers are “endorsing creationism in their classrooms, often devoting one to four class hours to creationism over the course of the year.” A synopsis of the survey, published in the Jan. 27, 2011, issue of Science magazine, says a “sizable number of teachers expose their students to all positions — scientific or not.” Plutzer told us: “One thing you can be certain of is that large numbers of public school science teachers in Texas are endorsing creationism.” Right. Chiding Perry on the facts in this case misses the point, because Perry wasn’t revealing his ignorance; he was accidentally speaking the truth. Perry knows you can’t put creationism in textbooks outright—Kitzmiller v. Dover took care of that—but the education agenda he supported was designed to achieve the same ends through a more roundabout process of enabling teachers to shoot holes in biology or making them so nervous about the subject that they avoid teaching evolution entirely.

On April 16, 2013, federal agents burst into a swanky apartment at Trump Tower in New York City as part of a larger raid that rounded up 29 suspected members of two global gambling rings with operations allegedly overseen by a supposed Russian mob boss named Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov. The Russian was not nabbed by US law enforcement. Since being indicted in the United States a decade earlier for allegedly rigging an ice skating competition at the 2002 Olympics, he had been living in Russia, beyond the reach of Western authorities. And this new gambling indictment did not appear to inconvenience Tokhtakhounov. Seven months after the bust, he was a VIP attendee at Donald Trump’s Miss Universe 2013 contest held in Moscow. In fact, Tokhtakhounov hit the red carpet within minutes of Trump. An alleged crime lord who was a fugitive from American justice was apparently a celebrity guest at Trump’s event. During the 2016 race, Trump’s associations with Russia have sparked assorted controversies. He has praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin and made a series of contradictory remarks regarding his relationship with the autocrat. (In July, Trump said he had never spoken to Putin, but in a 2014 video, he claimed he had.) Trump has insisted on the campaign trail, “I have nothing to do with Russia.” Yet he has a long history of attempting—and generally failing—to forge deals in that country. And Trump has been surrounded by campaign aides—including onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort—with close and lucrative business ties to Russia and Putin allies. Contrary to his claim of having nothing to do with Russia, Trump did pull off one major deal there: staging the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in the nation’s capital. At the time, Trump co-owned the contest with NBC. The event landed him in the company of Tokhtakhounov and other high-profile Russians. And Trump hoped it would also bring him close to Putin. Months before the contest, he tweeted, “Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow – if so, will he become my new best friend?” Putin didn’t show up, but, according to Russian media accounts and photos of the event, Tokhtakhounov did. He was part of a crew of wealthy and powerful Russians who, according to a press report, were treated as VIPs. Also present were Vladimir Kozhin, a top government official and member of Putin’s inner circle (who the following year would be hit with US sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) and Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire oligarch close to Putin with whom Trump wanted to develop a high-rise in Moscow. (Agalarov played a role in drawing the beauty contest to Moscow; it was held in a concert hall owned by his family business empire, and his son, a middling pop star, performed at the pageant.) After the event, Trump boasted to the New York Post, “Almost all of the oligarchs were in the room.” Asked how Tokhtakhounov came to be part of the red-carpet crowd at the event, a spokeswoman for Miss Universe, which Trump sold in 2015, said she was not familiar with his name. In a phone interview with Mother Jones, Tokhtakhounov initially said he had not attended the beauty pageant. After being told that there were photos and media reports showing that he had been there, he acknowledged that he had been present at the glitzy gathering. But he denied that he had been a VIP and said he had purchased his own ticket. Tokhtakhounov also said he had no interaction with Trump at the event. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov’s tale is an intriguing story of sports, Hollywood stars, poker, and alleged crime. The indictment filed by Preet Bharara, the US attorney in Manhattan, which triggered the 2013 raid, identified Tokhtakhounov as a vory v zakone—or a vor—a Russian term for a select group of the highest-level Russian crime bosses. A vor receives tributes from other criminals, offers protection, and adjudicates conflicts among other crooks. The indictment charged that Tokhtakhounov used his “substantial influence in the criminal underworld” to protect a high-stakes illegal gambling ring operating out of Trump Tower. He sometimes deployed “explicit threats of violence and economic harm” to handle disputes arising from this gambling operation. The indictment noted that in one two-month period he was paid $10 million by this outfit for his services. The operations of the gambling scheme were handled by two other men: Vadim Trincher and Anatoly Golubchik. The indictment alleged that they and others ran “an international gambling business that catered to oligarchs residing in the former Soviet Union and throughout the world,” used “threats of violence to obtain unpaid gambling debts,” and “employed a sophisticated money laundering scheme to move tens of millions of dollars…from the former Soviet Union through shell companies in Cyprus into various investments and other shell companies in the United States.” According to the US attorney, their enterprise “booked sports bets that reached into the millions of dollars” and laundered approximately $100 million. Trincher, a dual citizen of the United States and Israel, was a championship professional poker player who had purchased a Trump Tower apartment located directly below an apartment owned by Donald Trump. In 2009, Trincher had paid $5 million for the posh pad. Two years later, he and his wife had reportedly hoped to hold a fundraiser in the apartment for Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign, but they had to cancel the event because of the presence of mold caused by a water leak. During one court hearing, the US attorney’s office said that Trincher, then 52 years old, directed much of the racketeering enterprise from this Trump Tower apartment. “From his apartment, he oversaw what must have been the world’s largest sports book,” Assistant US Attorney Harris Fischman remarked. “He catered to millionaires and billionaires.” The indictment also targeted an associated gambling ring operated by Trincher’s son Illya, Hillel Nahmad, the son of a billionaire art dealer, and others. (Nahmad also reportedly owned the entire 51st floor of Trump Tower.) This crew managed a high-stakes betting operation and money-laundering shop. The indictment charged another Trincher son named Eugene and several others with running illegal high-stakes poker rooms in and around New York City. This group included Molly Bloom, who had previously earned a reputation as an organizer of private poker games for celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. Following the raid, the New York Daily News reported that a witness told the paper that “games held by the crew in a Trump Tower apartment…[were] poker ‘on steroids,’ with cameos by movie and sports stars, including A-Rod.” Shortly after the indictment was issued, Tokhtakhounov told a Russian television channel that the case against him was “yet another fairy tale from the Americans.” He claimed the prosecutors had included him in the indictment “to give the situation significance.” He acknowledged that he knew two of the defendants and had placed bets with them. “Of course, in conversation,” he added, “I might have given them advice on how to do things better.” Tokhtakhounov was trying to depict himself as a victim unfairly targeted by the United States. In 2002, he was indicted for allegedly fixing skating matches at the Salt Lake City Olympics. (The feds believed he had rigged events so that Russians would take home a gold and a French pair would win another gold—and he would pocket a French visa.) He was arrested in Italy, but soon Tokhtakhounov, who denied the charges, was let go and made his way back to Russia. Something of a celebrity in Russia, Tokhtakhounov has engaged in various enterprises. He once owned casinos in Moscow. He claimed to be an organizer of pop concerts and fashion shows. He represented a modeling association, and he wrote novels. He lived in a high-end apartment building in Moscow and kept a palatial country house outside the city. He is currently wanted by Interpol for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, bribery conspiracy, wire fraud, and “bribery in sport contests.” A year following the Trump Tower raid, Trincher and Golubchik, after pleading guilty, were each sentenced to five years in prison. Each man was ordered to forfeit more than $20 million in cash, investments, and property. (Trincher’s sons, Nahmad, and Bloom also pled guilty.) Tokhtakhounov, the US attorney’s office noted, remained a fugitive. Trump has cited the 2013 Miss Universe contest as proof he possesses serious foreign policy experience. In May, he told Fox News, “I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, which was a big, big incredible event.” And it provided the reality television mogul the opportunity to hobnob with a Putin crony who is now under US sanctions, various oligarchs who are chums with the Russian leader, and an alleged Russian mafioso accused by the US government of protecting a global criminal enterprise that operated directly below one of Trump’s own apartments in Trump Tower.

        "articles": "Palm Beach Post/ZUMAPress When the news broke in early December that former GOP Rep. Dick Armey had abruptly resigned as chairman of FreedomWorks, a powerhouse of the conservative movement and an instrumental force within the tea party, Armey maintained that the nasty split was due to differences he had with the top management of FreedomWorks about the group’s operations and future. Immediately, media reports disclosed that Armey had been concerned that Matt Kibbe, the group’s president, had used FreedomWorks resources to promote a book he had written (which was released in June) and that Armey himself had received an $8 million payout from a FreedomWorks board member to ease his departure. But internal documents obtained by Mother Jones show that the bitter war inside FreedomWorks has also resulted in allegations of staff wrongdoing (prompting an investigation by lawyers) and counter-allegations that Armey and his allies tried to turn FreedomWorks into a partisan outfit backing establishment Republicans over tea party insurgents. On December 12, James Burnley IV and C. Boyden Gray, two FreedomWorks board members (and allies of Armey), sent Kibbe a letter informing him that they had received “allegations of wrongdoing by the organization or its employees.” They notified Kibbe that the group’s board of trustees had retained two attorneys, Alfred Regnery and David Martin, to conduct an independent investigation of the allegations. Burnley and Gray ordered Kibbe to cooperate with the lawyers, to make sure no records were “destroyed, deleted, modified or otherwise tampered with,” and to send Regnery a check for $25,000 to cover his initial fees. (Regnery, a prominent conservative, is the past president of Regnery Publishing, a right-wing firm that has put out books by Ann Coulter, Michelle Malkin, Pat Buchanan, and other notable conservatives.) The letter did not specify the allegations being investigated. In an interview with Mother Jones, Burnley declined to discuss the alleged wrongdoing at FreedomWorks. “The letter speaks for itself,” he says. Gray, Kibbe, and a spokeswoman for FreedomWorks did not respond to requests for comment. Shortly after receiving the December 12 letter, Kibbe wrote a memo outlining his beef with Armey, Burnley, and Gray. In the document—titled “Republican Insiders Attempt Hostile Takeover of FreedomWorks”—Kibbe accused the three of being shills for the Republican establishment and undercutting the group’s standing as an independent, non-partisan, conservative organization. (FreedomWorks has at times endorsed tea party candidates in primary elections against mainstream or incumbent Republicans, drawing the ire of mainline Republicans.) Kibbe charged that the three men were trying to punish him for defying their effort to steer FreedomWorks into the conventional Republican fold. He contended that the divisive fight within FreedomWorks was not really about his book contract or other organizational matters; it was a grand ideological clash pitting those fully loyal to the tea party cause (such as Kibbe) against backroom, Washington-centric pols attempting to wield their influence to benefit their pals. Noting Armey’s habit of coining maxims—and Armey’s complaint that Kibbe had hijacked media requests for Armey—Kibbe began his memo with a blast referencing a September 4 meeting at which Armey and Gray had voted Kibbe off the board of trustees and replaced him with Burnley, a secretary of transportation in the Reagan administration: Our favorite “Armey’s Axiom” goes something like this: “Every argument in Washington, like in a marriage, is really about something else.” So it goes with the attempted hostile takeover of FreedomWorks by three Republican insiders from the old guard. Is it about a book contract, or a pilfered appearance on CNBC? No, it is not. As it turns out, the fight for lower taxes, less government and more freedom is all well and good until it is Republicans—”old friends”— that are the ones needing to be held to account. It is our sense that the irresponsible acts of the so-called Trustees of FreedomWorks—Dick Armey, C. Boyden Gray, and James C. Burnley—on September 4th, and their continued hostile acts today, are all about retribution for our willingness to take a strictly nonpartisan approach to politics, our willingness to hold both Republicans and Democrats to the standards set out by our freedom philosophy and the clear limits on government power delineated in our U.S. Constitution. Kibbe then presented a timeline seeking to demonstrate that Armey, Gray, and Burnley had sold out the tea party cause to help less conservative Republicans. His first example: the Republican primary contest earlier this year pitting Rep. Ben Quayle against Rep. David Schweikert, two House freshmen thrown into the same congressional district after redistricting in Arizona. In May, FreedomWorks endorsed Schweikert, who, Kibbe wrote, “had been willing to stand on principle even under tremendous pressure” from the GOP top brass. Quayle, according to Kibbe, had been too “reliable” a vote for the House Republican leadership, which FreedomWorks occasionally has opposed from the right. Yet Gray, the memo noted, was sending donations to Quayle, the son of former Vice President Dan Quayle. (Gray was White House counsel during the Bush-Quayle administration.) And Gray, Kibbe wrote, called him several times last summer “wondering why we were engaged in this primary fight.” In the memo, Kibbe pointed out other conflicts as well. When Rep. John Mica, the Republican chair of the House transportation and infrastructure committee, was challenged by tea party freshman Rep. Sandy Adams in Florida in another primary race caused by redistricting, Kibbe wrote, Burnley, a transportation lobbyist, called Kibbe and “made it very clear…that he had a dog in this race.” And on June 16, when FreedomWorks announced its “Retire Hatch” campaign against Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Gray endorsed Hatch. A month later, Gray held a fundraiser for Wisconsin senatorial candidate Tommy Thompson—two days before FreedomWorks endorsed tea party favorite Eric Hovde, who was challenging Thompson in the GOP primary. All of these conflicts, Kibbe maintained in the memo, led to that September meeting when he was booted off the board. Referring to himself in the third person, Kibbe described that confrontation: “It is eight weeks out from the most important election in our lifetime. ‘Do you have any idea,’ Kibbe asks, ‘how much your actions will damage FreedomWorks efforts?’ No answer is given.” The memo went on, with Kibbe taking Armey to task for having urged FreedomWorks to assist Thompson, who won the primary but whom the group had declined to endorse in the general election due to his “full-throated advocacy of ObamaCare,” and Rep. Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri who had come under fire for his “legitimate rape” remarks: One of the first actions taken by Dick Armey [after the September meeting] is his attempt to reassess our political priorities. “We have to help my friend Tommy Thompson,” he tells the staff in his first meeting with them. He later tells the staff that he has discussed the Missouri Senate race with “my friend [Senator] Roy Blunt, and he says they really need grassroots cover for Todd Akin.” FreedomWorks PAC had endorsed John Brunner, who barely lost to Akin [in the GOP primary]. We had declined to endorse Akin, even before “legitimate rape” became a late night punch line. At the conclusion of his memo, Kibbe linked Mother Jones’ December 3 disclosure of Armey’s departure from FreedomWorks—one of several media reports supposedly featuring Armey “trashing the senior management of FreedomWorks”—to House Speaker John Boehner stripping FreedomWorks-backed legislators of key committee assignments in what conservative pundits denounced as a purge aimed at tea party lawmakers. And Kibbe ended with this broad swipe: Bottom Line: The Actions of the Trustees Put FreedomWorks Values and Mission at Risk. They have put personal and political agendas above the agenda of freedom. The memo does not indicate to whom the document was sent. Burnley tells Mother Jones he has not seen it and was unaware of its existence. Armey says the same. About the time he drafted this missive, Kibbe also wrote a memo to the FreedomWorks board for its winter meeting on December 19. In it, he only gently referred to the internal troubles: Dick Armey’s recent resignation from FreedomWorks was, for me, one of the most difficult [changes] to absorb. There was a time when he was a father figure to me, and we collaborated on things like our bestselling book Give Us Liberty. This particular change has been painful. But we respect his desires and wish him all the best in future endeavors… Unfortunately, what I had hoped to be a quiet and focused transition has instead attracted quite a bit of media attention. He noted that the group’s freedom-defending mission was more important than “parlor intrigue.” For his part, Armey is not so diplomatic. After being read portions of the Kibbe document, he says, “One of the most fascinating art forms in Washington is that of the perpetrator as victim. Matt Kibbe seems to have maintained it with this memorandum.” Armey takes issue with Kibbe’s claim that he kowtowed to the GOP establishment. “After September 1, I was indeed getting reports from Wisconsin and Missouri that we could win those Senate races and also pull it out in these states for Romney,” Armey remarks, defending his decision to urge FreedomWorks to swing behind Thompson and Akin in the fall (after their primary wins). “The alternative in these states was that liberal Democrats win and so does Obama.” And Armey scoffs at the charge that he, Gray, and Burnley tried to subvert FreedomWorks and its devotion to the tea party cause to please the GOP mainstream in Washington. “There’s nobody at FreedomWorks or on the board who suffered more criticism and abusive complaining and expressions of disappointment from establishment Republicans for the actions of this organization than C. Boyden Gray, Jim Burnley, or Dick Armey,” Armey insists. “None of us ever suggested we change what we were doing in response to the complaints.” Armey notes that he was an early endorser of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a tea party favorite who faced a sitting Republican governor in a primary, and Senator-elect Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a tea partier who defeated a sitting Republican lieutenant governor in the GOP primary. Kibbe’s memo does not reveal whether Kibbe is ready to go public with his harsh charge that Armey, Gray, and Burnley have betrayed the tea party movement, and the Burnley-Gray letter does not indicate whether the legal probe they ordered will threaten the operations of FreedomWorks. But with the House Republican leadership in disarray and the National Rifle Association under fire after the Newtown shootings, the raging civil war at FreedomWorks is yet more bad news for conservatives at the end of 2012.

        "articles": "House Speaker Paul Ryan leads a news conference at the Capitol on Tuesday. Tom Williams/AP After years of railing against deficit spending, House Republicans voted on Thursday for a budget resolution that allows for $1.5 trillion of deficit spending to finance tax cuts. Nearly 80 percent of the cuts would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, according to an initial estimate from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Every Democrat and 20 Republicans voted against the budget resolution, which passed 216-212. The resolution allows Congress to fast-track tax cuts using a process known as reconciliation—meaning the Senate will only need a simple majority, instead of the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Most of the Republican opposition came from the GOP’s plan to eliminate deductions for state and local taxes, with 11 Republicans from New York and New Jersey voting against the bill. Eliminating the deduction, which disproportionately affects well-off families in high-tax states, is the main reason why Trump’s plan would raise taxes on one in six Americans, according to the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. In Maryland, nearly one in three households would see their taxes go up as the state’s top 1 percent gets a $74,470 annual windfall. Republicans in Congress may soften the blow by providing a tax credit for property taxes, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. That change could make the tax bill more politically palatable for blue-state Republicans, but it would make the tax cuts far more expensive. Without that change, the Tax Policy Center estimates that Trump’s plan would already increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over ten years—$900 billion more than the self-imposed limit in the budget Congress passed Thursday. If the GOP replaces the state and local tax deduction with a property tax credit, that deficit spending would balloon by up to another $700 billion. During the Obama administration, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said the United States needed to “tackle this debt crisis before it tackles us.” To address that crisis, Ryan proposed massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans have explained the apparent about-face on the national debt by saying their plan actually raises tax revenue by unleashing economic growth. But experts disagree with Republicans’ math. A May survey by the University of Chicago’s business school found that almost no economists believe that increased economic growth would offset the costs of Trump’s tax cuts. On Thursday, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) was one of the few Republicans who stuck to his Obama-era position on deficit-spending. “2011-2016: Principles!” he wrote on Twitter before the vote. “2017: End justifies the means.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "At its core, the dispute over the budget and the debt ceiling isn’t complicated at all. But it is full of misconceptions and urban myths. Here are the 10 facts worth remembering past all the obfuscation: 1. Democrats have already agreed to fund the government at Republican levels. 2. Despite what you might have heard, there have only been two serious government shutdowns in recent history, and both were the result of Republican ultimatums. 3. Democrats in the Senate have been begging the House to negotiate over the budget for the past six months, but Republicans have refused. 4. That’s because Republicans wanted to wait until they had either a government shutdown or a debt ceiling breach as leverage, something they’ve been very clear about all along. 5. Republicans keep talking about compromise, but they’ve offered nothing in return for agreeing to their demands—except to keep the government intact if they get their way. 6. The public is very strongly opposed to using a government shutdown to stop Obamacare. 7. Contrary to Republican claims, the deficit is not increasing—it peaked in 2009 and has been dropping ever since, declining by $200 billion last year with another $450 billion drop projected this year. 8. A long government shutdown is likely to seriously hurt economic growth, with a monthlong shutdown projected to slash GDP in the fourth quarter by 1 percentage point and reduce employment by over a million jobs. 9. No, Democrats have not used debt ceiling hostage taking in the past to force presidents to accept their political agenda. 10. This whole dispute is about the Republican Party fighting to make sure the working poor don’t have access to affordable health care.

        "articles": "<a  target=\"_blank\">Flickr/Friedwall</a> On Friday, a federal appeals court ruled that President Barack Obama’s appointments to the National Labor Relations Board, which regulates and oversees labor disputes, were unconstitutional. The Constitution allows the president to make temporary appointments, called recess appointments, while the Senate is on break—or recess, in DC terms. Obama did make the NRLB appointments while the Senate was on vacation. But Senate Republicans claimed that the Senate was technically still in session over their vacation because they were holding brief, minutes-long meetings over the course of the break. The three judges on the panel—all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents—agreed with the challengers. Now all the decisions Obama’s NLRB appointees made since they joined the board are at risk of being invalidated. The court’s decision doesn’t just affect labor law: it could also have an impact on the White House’s broader economic agenda. The sweeping ruling throws into question the future of regulatory decisions made by one of the administration’s most aggressive agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Richard Cordray, the CFBP’s director, was appointed at the same time and in the same manner as the three labor board members. That means the appeals court’s ruling could put the enforceability of his decisions in question, too. Since Cordray’s appointment, the CFPB has set rules preventing mortgage lenders from lying to borrowers about rates, fined credit card companies for violating consumer protection laws, and forced debt-relief services to refund illegal fees they charged to their cash strapped clients. In other words, the Bureau has done what liberals hoped and Republicans feared: Prevented companies from gouging consumers with the kind of unscrupulous business practices that caused a nationwide economic meltdown four years ago. Although Cordray’s appointment is being challenged separately, Friday’s ruling gives companies impacted by the CFPB’s decisions an opening to argue that some of the CFPB’s actions should be invalidated. Cordray has been renominated as the CFPB’s director, but Republicans could easily filibuster him again. Last January, when Senate Republicans held their brief vacation sessions, there was little pretense that it was anything more than an obstructionist gimmick: Rep. Dianne Black (R-Tenn.) complained that Obama only put forth the names of his appointments “two days before the Senate recessed for the holiday.” That would be the same recess that the Senate—and now the DC Circuit Court—has said technically didn’t happen. Democrats have tried similar vacation meetings, which are called pro-forma sessions, in the past. But as with the filibuster, Republicans have perfected the practice. Obama only turned to recess appointments because Republican obstructionism was blocking major government agencies from doing their jobs. The NLRB had no power to make decisions absent at least three of the five members of the board, and the CFPB’s regulatory authority was similarly hampered by the absence of a director. As my colleague Kevin Drum noted at the time, this was nothing less than the Republicans nullifying a duly-passed financial regulatory law they didn’t like. Friday’s ruling takes the sweeping view that recess appointments made during Senate breaks, like vacations, are unconstitutional. The court found that the recess appointment power can only be used during breaks between Senate sessions—and those only happen once a year, usually over the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. It also holds that the president can only make recess appointments for positions that become open during a recess—as opposed to ones that already were open. The court’s position would invalidate the vast majority of recess appointments made by Republican and Democratic presidents over the course of the last century, including that of John Bolton, George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations. “That is really a radical position to take,” says Caroline Fredrickson, president of the liberal American Constitution Society. “A president could be prevented from having any of his nominees confirmed.” Fredrickson says she expects the administration to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case as soon as possible. Here’s the best part: If the decision holds, then Senate Republicans just acquired even more power to block presidential appointments than they already had. Good thing the Democrats decided to cave almost entirely on filibuster reform just a day earlier. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Can a state ban a type of abortion, entirely? That’s the question the US Supreme Court is now weighing. In June, the court agreed to hear a challenge to a 2011 Oklahoma law that bars doctors from prescribing abortion drugs, unless they follow the FDA label. Supporters of the bill argue the goal is to protect women’s health. “Oklahoma has acted to regulate a dangerous off-label use of a drug regimen that is tied to the deaths of at least eight women,” says Mailee Smith, a lawyer for Americans United for Life, which drafted the legislation. But critics maintain the language is so broad it would block access to all abortion drugs—including those used to treat life-threatening ectopic pregnancies. And the Oklahoma Supreme Court agrees. In response to a query from the US Supreme Court, on Tuesday the state court ruled that the bill effectively “bans all medication abortions” and thus is unconstitutional. It may seem counterintuitive that following the FDA labeling would hamper access. But two of the three most commonly used abortion drugs, misoprostol and methotrexate, were initially approved to treat other conditions. The World Health Organization and independent researchers have since found that they are a safe and effective way to end an early pregnancy, and doctors routinely prescribe them for this purpose. But the drugs’ manufacturers never went through the costly process of updating their FDA labels. This is not unusual. Once a drug is approved, the FDA normally doesn’t change the label unless new risks come to light. But doctors are free to tailor treatments to reflect the latest research, which is one reason that roughly 20 percent of all outpatient prescriptions are off label. Hover over a state to see a breakdown of restrictions in place there. Source: Guttmacher Institute. ? Women’s health advocates are particularly alarmed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s finding that the law would ban the use of methotrexate to treat ectopic pregnancies (when an embryo develops outside of the womb). The only other treatment for this condition is surgery. According to Nancy Stanwood, the chairwoman of Physicians for Reproductive Health and chief of family planning at the Yale School of Medicine, this isn’t a safe option for every patient. “Some women may not be candidates for surgery because they have underlying medical conditions or a high-risk of complications from anesthesia,” she explains. “Taking methotrexate off the table would be devastating.” The Oklahoma Supreme Court also found the measure would bar the use of the lone FDA-labeled abortion drug, RU486 (also known as Mifeprex or mifepristone). Why? Because RU486’s label calls for taking it in combination with another pill that’s not FDA-approved for abortion—meaning it’s impossible to prescribe the two drugs in a way that complies with both of their FDA labels. Shortly after the Oklahoma Legislature passed the abortion-drug law in 2011, the Coalition for Reproductive Justice and the Center for Reproductive Rights sued to block it—and won. In his opinion, District Judge Donald Worthington concluded that the law was “so completely at odds with the standard that governs the practice of medicine that it can serve no purpose other than to prevent women from obtaining abortions.” The Oklahoma Supreme Court later upheld the decision, but it didn’t spell out its rationale. After it agreed to take the case, the US Supreme Court asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to clarify the breadth of the law and whether it barred all abortion drugs, which is how Tuesday’s ruling came about. Some court watchers suspect the Oklahoma court’s finding will be enough to persuade the US Supreme Court justices to drop the case. “They may well dismiss the case as improvidently granted, meaning they say, ‘Never mind, we’re not going to weigh in,'” explains Hank Greely, who directs the Center for Law and Biosciences at Stanford University. If that happens, the law would remain blocked. The Oklahoma measure is part of a wave of restrictions on abortion drugs sweeping through the United States. According to the Guttmacher Institute, in recent years at least 39 states have passed bills clamping down on abortion drugs by, among other things, requiring doctors to be physically present when patient takes the drug. On Monday, a federal court in Texas upheld the part of the state’s ultra-strict abortion law requiring women to use RU486 according to the FDA label. While less restrictive than the Oklahoma bill, critics argue the Texas measure—and similar ones on the books in three other states—seriously intrude on the doctor-patient relationship. Under these laws, doctors would be required to use the exact RU486 regimen called for in its FDA label, which was approved 13 years ago. Since then, studies by the World Health Organization and independent scientists have found that the drug is equally effective at a third of the original dose. What’s more, the drug can be used nine weeks into pregnancy, rather than just seven, as its label states. Both the WHO and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommend a lower dose and fewer doctors’ visits than outlined by the FDA. In its Monday ruling, the Texas court explained why the FDA-recommended approach has fallen out of favor: [T]he FDA protocol is assuredly more imposing and unpleasant for the woman, requiring at least one additional visit to a clinic and allowing less control over the timing and convenience of the medically induced miscarriage. It also requires more of the physician’s time, as the physician must administer the second dose. The FDA protocol is also marginally more expensive, due to the increased dosage, notwithstanding any additional cost of travel, time off of work, and childcare. Most importantly, the FDA protocol removes medication abortion as an option for any woman who discovers she is pregnant or decides to terminate a pregnancy after [7 weeks]. Still, the court found the law was constitutional, except in cases where a woman’s life was endangered by lack of access to abortion medications. When the FDA approved RU486 in 2000, some predicted it would lead to a surge in abortions and make it more difficult for opponents to fight—no more picketing abortion clinics. In fact, the overall number of abortions has dropped, and a greater share of women are getting abortions in the first weeks of pregnancy, thanks partly to abortion drugs, which can be used earlier than other readily available abortion methods. (One in five early abortions in the United States today are performed with medication.) Abortion drugs can make it easier for rural women, in particular, to access early abortions. As New York magazine has reported, in 2008, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland launched a program to improve access in far-flung parts of Iowa by allowing doctors to prescribe abortion drugs remotely. Women could walk into any of the state’s 17 clinics, get an ultrasound, and consult with a doctor at one of Planned Parenthood’s larger, urban offices using internet video conferencing, after which the doctor would push a button and dispense the first dose. But that model is slowly disappearing. Seventeen states—including Iowa—have laws on the books requiring the doctors who prescribe abortion drugs to be physically present. Like the Texas law requiring abortions to be performed in a particular kind of surgical center, the abortion-drug measures are ostensibly meant to protect women’s health. But in practice they block access. If the US Supreme Court moves ahead with the Oklahoma case, Greely of Stanford says it could be a litmus test for this strategy of restricting abortion through piecemeal legislation based on dubious concerns. “Any Supreme Court decision upholding one of these measures,” he says, “makes all the others that much more viable.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "helenecanada/iStock “The one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom, be he any color of the rainbow, but people have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury box.” —Lawyer Atticus Finch in Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird In April 2005, nearly eight years after Kenneth Fults was sentenced to death for kidnapping and murdering his neighbor Cathy Bounds in Spalding County, Georgia, one of the trial jurors made a startling admission under oath: He’d voted for the death penalty, he said, because “that’s what that nigger deserved.” It shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise, given the circumstances—a black man admitting to the murder of a white woman in the deep South—that some white jurors might secretly harbor racist views. The surprising part was that this juror, Thomas Buffington, came right out and said it. And what should have been the most surprising development of all (alas, it wasn’t) came this past August, when a federal appeals court, presented with ample evidence, refused to consider how racism might have affected Fults’ fate. In fact, state and federal courts have routinely avoided the evidence and consequences of racism in the criminal-justice system. (See “5 Death Penalty Cases Tainted by Racism.”) Consider one of the most famous examples, the 1987 Supreme Court case of McCleskey v. Kemp, in which lawyers for Warren McCleskey, a black man sentenced to death for killing a white police officer, presented statistics from more than 2,000 Georgia murder cases. The data demonstrated a clear bias against black defendants whose victims were white: When both killer and victim were black, only 1 percent of the cases resulted in a death sentence. When the killer was black and the victim white, 22 percent were sentenced to death—more than seven times the rate for when the races were reversed. It wasn’t just jurors who were biased. Prosecutors sought the death penalty for black defendants in 70 percent of murder cases when the victim was white, but only 15 percent when the victim was black. The Supreme Court was less than impressed with all of this. Justice Lewis Powell, in a 5-4 majority opinion he would later call his greatest regret on the bench, wrote that McCleskey could not prove that “the decisionmakers in his case acted with discriminatory purpose.” In short, evidence of systemic racial bias had no relevance in individual cases. Further on, Powell got down to his true concern: “McCleskey’s claim, taken to its logical conclusion, throws into serious question the principles that underlie our entire criminal justice system.” Justice William Brennan dissented with one of the most memorable statements of his iconic career: “Taken on its face, such a statement seems to suggest a fear of too much justice.” He went on: “The prospect that there may be more widespread abuse than McCleskey documents may be dismaying, but it does not justify complete abdication of our judicial role.” Georgia executed McCleskey in 1991, but the McCleskey rationale—which the New York Times labeled the “impossible burden” of proving that racial animus motivated any particular prosecutor, judge, or jury—has been used by dozens of courts to reject statistical claims of discrimination in capital cases, even though today’s numbers are not much better. The Fults case was different, though. Here was an actual juror explaining his decision to impose the death sentence through a blatantly racist lens. It was precisely the sort of evidence the Supreme Court claimed was lacking in the McCleskey case. So why has Kenneth Fults not been granted a new sentencing? Justice Powell’s concerns are understandable. After all, what part of the criminal justice system is untouched by racism? Some death penalty critics, in fact, view capital punishment as a direct descendent of lynching. The phrase “legal lynching” first appeared in the New York Times during the infamous 1931 Scottsboro Boys trials, in which nine black youths were charged with raping two white women in Alabama. Their lack of counsel, coupled with the explicit exclusion of black jurors, led the Supreme Court to intercede twice and reverse convictions. It’s hard to read those opinions today without feeling a sense of horror. Within two weeks of the alleged crime, eight of the nine young men had been sentenced to death in three separate trials by the same jury. Although there was no shortage of black men in Scottsboro County who were legally eligible to serve on juries, there was no record of any of them ever serving on one. Perhaps most remarkably, none of the defendants had a lawyer appointed to represent him until the morning of trial. In 2013, more than 80 years after the arrests, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles posthumously pardoned the three Scottsboro Boys whose convictions still stood. We have not come nearly as far from these outrages as you might think. People of color are still dramatically underrepresented on juries and grand juries, even though excluding people based on race is illegal and undermines “public confidence in our system of justice,” as the Supreme Court put it in 1986. Prospective black jurors are routinely dismissed at higher rates than whites. The law simply requires some rationale other than skin color. “Question them at length,” a prominent Philadelphia prosecutor suggested to his protégés after the Supreme Court banned race as a reason for striking jurors. “Mark something down that you can articulate at a later time.” For instance, a lawyer might say, “Well, the woman had a kid about the same age as the defendant, and I thought she’d be sympathetic to him.” In 2005, a former prosecutor in Texas revealed that her superiors had instructed her, if she wanted to strike a black juror, to falsely claim that she’d seen the person sleeping. This was just a dressed-up version of the Dallas prosecution training manual from 1963, which directed assistant district attorneys to “not take Jews, Negroes, Dagos, Mexicans, or a member of any minority race on a jury, no matter how rich or how well educated.” The 1969 edition of the manual, used into the 1980s, promoted a more subtle brand of stereotyping, noting that it was “not advisable to select potential jurors with multiple gold chains around their necks.” But it hardly mattered: Overt, covert, or in between—the result was the same. Virtually every state with a death penalty has dealt with accusations that black jurors have been improperly kept off juries. During the 1992 death penalty trial of a defendant named George Williams, for example, a California prosecutor dismissed the first five black women in the jury box. “Sometimes you get a feel for a person,” he explained, “that you just know that they can’t impose it based upon the nature of the way that they say something.” The judge went even further, noting that “black women are very reluctant to impose the death penalty; they find it very difficult.” In 2013, the California Supreme Court ruled that these jury strikes were not race-based, and deemed the judge’s statement “isolated.” Williams remains on death row. After North Carolina passed its Racial Justice Act, a 2009 law that let inmates challenge death sentences based on racial bias, a state court determined that prosecutors were dismissing black jurors at twice the rate of other jurors. The probability of this being a race-neutral fluke, according to two professors from Michigan State University, was less than 1 in 10 trillion; even the state’s expert agreed that the disparity was statistically significant. Based on these numbers, the court vacated the death sentences of three inmates and resentenced each to life without parole. Six months later, the state legislature repealed the Racial Justice Act. Perhaps You’re Still wondering, despite all of the above, how Thomas Buffington ended up on the Fults jury. The answer is simple. He lied: Defense attorney: Do you have any racial prejudice resting on your mind?Buffington: No, sir.Defense attorney: Does it make any difference that in this case the defendant is black and the victim was white?Buffington: No, sir. Even this sort of cursory questioning wasn’t required by the Supreme Court until 1986, and then only in capital cases—and when the defense requests it. In order to function, the justice system has to presume that jurors will tell the truth under oath, just as it presumes lawyers are competent. And what of the lawyers’ role? Since 1976, when mandatory death sentences were ruled unconstitutional, the decision of whether to seek execution has rested entirely with the local district attorney. In practice, this means a white man usually gets to decide who should face the death chamber. A 2009 study found that more than 85 percent of chief prosecutors in the United States were white, and the majority were male. In the Fults case, that white man was William McBroom, district attorney of the Griffin Judicial Circuit. McBroom had already put two men on death row by the time he prosecuted Fults, and continued to aggressively seek and obtain death verdicts until 2004, when he lost his reelection by a hair. He wasn’t the type to fret over moral ambiguities: McBroom sought death sentences at every opportunity, thereby avoiding allegations of discrimination in the charging process. His tough approach found an unlikely ally in Johnny Mostiler, the Spalding County public defender, who happened to be representing Kenneth Fults. “We’re finding ourselves facing crimes we think are Atlanta big-city crimes,” Mostiler proclaimed at one point. “We’re a law-abiding town. We want our criminals prosecuted.” McBroom and Mostiler knew each other so well that the Fults transcript sometimes reads like old friends reminiscing: McBroom points out how Mostiler is going to respond, mentions an argument his rival made in an earlier case, and refers to him by first name before handing over the floor for closing arguments. “Mostiler was the toughest trial lawyer in Spalding County,” McBroom recalled some years after the Fults trial. “He would take cases where you didn’t think defendants had a chance, and you’d be fighting for your life.” He had every reason to praise Mostiler. A death verdict is invariably followed by appeals in which the defense attorney’s work comes under close scrutiny. Prosecutors routinely hail their adversaries as giants in the field of capital defense to make it harder for any defendant to claim his lawyer was incompetent. And McBroom, who had obtained death verdicts against Mostiler in several prior cases, needed to defend some deplorable behavior: For all intents and purposes, Johnny Mostiler, like Thomas Buffington, was a racist. Spalding County, 40 miles south of Atlanta, has but a single public defender to represent criminal defendants who can’t afford an attorney—and a great majority cannot. All through the 1990s, Mostiler was that defender, responsible for handling as many as 900 felonies a year. He also maintained a significant civil practice on the side and took on serious felony cases outside of Spalding County. But he was hardly your humble, nose to the grindstone type. According to a 2001 profile in The American Prospect, he stood out in a black cowboy hat; a silver beard with handlebar mustache; six gold, silver, and onyx rings; and three gold bracelets. He also drove a mustard-green 1972 Cadillac El Dorado convertible—with cattle horns as a hood ornament. But Mostiler’s true legacy—he died of a heart attack a few years after the Fults trial—involved the case of his former client Curtis Osborne, who was tried in 1991, found guilty of murder, and finally scheduled for execution in 2008. As the clock wound down on Osborne’s appeals, a former US attorney general, a former Georgia chief justice, and former President Jimmy Carter (previously the governor of Georgia) all spoke out against the execution. They had heard the allegation by another one of Mostiler’s clients, a white man named Gerald Huey, that Mostiler had told him, speaking of Osborne, that “that little nigger deserves the chair.” Some time later, a Georgia lawyer named Arleen Evans stepped forward with a sworn recollection about Mostiler’s personal conduct: I recall one occasion when I was in the lawyer’s lounge at the Spalding County Courthouse. There were a number of other lawyers there including Mr. Mostiler. Mr. Mostiler began telling racist jokes filled with racial epithets like “nigger.” Some of the lawyers would laugh. Some would laugh nervously. Some would try to ignore it. And others would leave the room to get away from it. On another occasion, I remember walking into the lawyer’s lounge and Mr. Mostiler was again telling racist jokes. Ms. Nancy Bradford, who is now deceased, looked at me, noticed that it was making me uncomfortable, and told me “that’s just Johnny.” Osborne’s lawyers soon dug up yet more evidence: a transcript from the trial of Derrick Middlebrooks, a black defendant who was so troubled by the racist talk that he asked the judge to dismiss Mostiler as his public defender: “He indicated to me that he wouldn’t—he couldn’t go up there among them niggers because them niggers would kill him,” Middlebrooks said. “Now personally I don’t know if he meant anything really by it. But I find it, you know, kind of hard to have an attorney to represent me when he uses those type of words. It doesn’t help my confidence in my attorney.” “I honestly don’t remember,” Mostiler responded when the judge asked him about it. “I don’t use those terms out in public. And I probably—if I did use it I certainly am sorry. I didn’t mean to indicate that it was any—or any racial overtones. I think my—I think my record on race is…” “Well documented in this court,” the judge interjected. Mostiler was long dead by the time his racist language became an issue in the Osborne case, but several prosecutors, including McBroom and his successor, District Attorney Scott Ballard, spoke up in his behalf. Mostiler had presented a “very adequate defense” of Curtis Osborne, Ballard argued. He urged that the execution go forward. Small counties tend to have incestuous legal communities. Public defenders and assistant district attorneys often swap sides and socialize together too; top assistants become bosses, and, most predictably, district attorneys end up on the bench. Such was the case with Johnnie Caldwell, Fults’ trial judge. Caldwell had preceded McBroom as district attorney of the Griffin Judicial Circuit. As both a prosecutor and a judge, Caldwell was well aware of the racism allegations surrounding Mostiler. It was he, in fact, who had heard Middlebrooks’ claim and used the opportunity to assure the public defender, saying: “It’s unchallenged in this court with your actions concerning the races and certainly of standing up for the rights of all individuals regardless of their race or color or religious preference.” Turning to Middlebrooks, he added: “I find nothing in Mr. Mostiler’s conduct of this trial or in representing you that would cause me to disqualify him.” By suggesting that the public defender of Spalding County—a man hired year after year by the county commissioners—was a racist, Middlebrooks had also, unwittingly, impugned the dignity of the prosecutor and the presiding judge. Caldwell was clearly put out: Middlebrooks: My motion for a new attorney is denied?Caldwell: Yes, sir.Middlebrooks: Okay. Thank you.Caldwell: And I know you’re sitting over there reading a book on ineffective assistance of counsel, you read it real well and write everything down, okay.Middlebrooks: Yes, sir.Caldwell: I’m directing you to. You write everything down and you write it well. You’ve been reading that book ever since you’ve been sitting over there.Middlebrooks: Judge, that has—Caldwell: Sir, don’t say anything else.Middlebrooks: Yes, sir. When race became an issue in the Osborne case, Caldwell didn’t step forward to disclose his interactions with Mostiler, nor did any of those other lawyers in the lounge, who had certainly heard the same racist jokes and comments Arleen Evans had. (Caldwell had his own problems: He resigned his judgeship in 2010 in light of allegations that he was soliciting female attorneys in open court. He was nonetheless elected, soon after, to the Georgia Legislature.) Ultimately, neither local nor federal courts were moved by the consistency of the race testimony. In 2006, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals soundly rejected Osborne’s claim that Mostiler was ineffective due to racial animosity. (Osborne was executed two years later.) Citing McCleskey, the court said it was the racial animus of the decision makers—the prosecutors and the jurors, not the defense attorney—that mattered. So what would the same court say eight years later, when lawyers for Kenneth Fults came before it with claims of racial animus involving a decision maker, the juror Thomas Buffington? In September 2013, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals convened in Miami to hear Fults’ claim. Half of their questions focused on legal hurdles, such as procedural default, cause and prejudice, impeachment of the verdict, and waiver. The other half dealt with the inexcusable nature of Buffington’s admission. The state wanted the court to reject Fults’ bias claim on a procedural technicality involving the rules of evidence, and Adalberto Jordan, the most outspoken of the judges, was struggling to understand why. “When you have a claim of a juror potentially recommending a sentence of death because of flat-out racial bias,” Jordan asked, “why would the state of Georgia not want that claim heard on the merits?” Assistant Attorney General Sabrina Graham insisted that Georgia law was clear on the issue. A verdict could not be reversed based on jury deliberations, no matter what any juror had to say about them afterward. In the process, she spent some awkward moments trying to persuade Jordan and Judge Stanley Marcus that what Buffington said wasn’t as damning as it sounded. Graham: I think there could not be any prejudice.Marcus: Tell me why there wouldn’t be prejudice, if in fact the juror was tainted with racism that affected his decision-making process?Graham: I don’t think you would have enough information to show that. Certainly Mr. Buffington uses a racially derogatory term. I do not think that his particular affidavit shows that he sentenced Mr. Fults to death based upon his racism. People have many prejudices—Jordan: “I knew I would vote for the death penalty because that’s what that nigger deserved.” You want something more specific than that?Graham: I think you do want something more specific.Jordan: Like?Graham: That was eight years after—Jordan: Like? Like what?Graham: Like “I sentenced him to death based upon his race—Marcus: Let’s suppose, just to take this to its logical conclusion, that there were 12 affidavits from all 12 jurors who voted for death, and each and every one of them said the same thing…Even if every juror says, “I voted to execute him because he was black,” you say, “That’s the law”?Graham: That is the law. That’s when Jordan, seemingly surprised by Graham’s answer, suggested that there was a “safety valve under Georgia law.” That is, if an evidentiary rule resulted in a violation of a defendant’s constitutional rights, it might justify an exception to that rule. Graham conceded that such a ruling might be possible. “They have left that possibility open, but they have never actually done anything about it.” She then pointed out that there are many reasons to trust a juror’s answers during jury selection rather than statements the juror might make after a verdict of death is returned: “Fine, you want to say Mr. Buffington lied during voir dire. [But] you have the trial court, and you have defense counsel all watching these jurors.” She was suggesting, in essence, that Johnny Mostiler, who had been accused of racism more than once, and Judge Caldwell, who’d belittled the claim of racism against Mostiler before being removed from the bench for harassing women in his own court, were suitable watchdogs to ensure an impartial jury. Was it possible she didn’t realize who they were? The 11th Circuit was not entirely unfamiliar with juror bias. Back in 1986, a man named Daniel Neal Heller had been convicted of tax evasion in Florida. Evidence showed that Heller, a Jewish man, was the butt of anti-Semitic jokes in the jury room that consistently prompted “gales of laughter.” The trial judge, when confronted by vague claims of discriminatory comments by the jury, cursorily asked each juror if he or she was “affected by prejudice.” The 11th Circuit’s three-judge panel reversed Heller’s conviction, writing that the jurors’ religious prejudice was “shocking to the conscience,” and concluding: “The people cannot be expected to respect their judicial system if its judges do not, first, do so.” The judges hearing the Fults case seemed to have forgotten the lessons of Heller. Despite their pointed questioning during oral arguments, the opinion they released 11 months later expressed neither shocked consciences nor fear of diminished respect for the system. If they were offended by Buffington’s admission, it was lost amid all of the procedural arcana. The prevailing narrative about legal technicalities, thanks to Hollywood portrayals and posturing politicians, is that they open jailhouse doors—which is one reason crime sometimes seems to be on the rise when in fact it is plummeting. In reality, though, legal technicalities are far more often used to preclude people from having their postconviction claims heard. The Fults opinion, written by the outspoken Judge Jordan, is a virtual primer on how the law has evolved to block, rather than illuminate, allegations of injustice. During oral arguments, Jordan seemed to be advocating a hearing to determine the circumstances of Buffington’s admission. In his opinion, however, he condemned the defense for failing to provide sufficient detail about how or when Buffington’s prejudice was discovered. While he had earlier questioned why Georgia didn’t want a claim of “flat-out racial bias” heard on its merits, his opinion articulated every reason the claim had not been properly presented, and now could not be considered. Finally, “in an abundance of caution,” he addressed the argument he seemed to be championing 11 months earlier: that the failure to consider Fults’ racial-prejudice claim would be a miscarriage of justice. Once again, Jordan felt compelled to explain that this claim had not been properly presented. In any case, he concluded that Fults had not shown that his sentence was a miscarriage of justice. For while it’s true that in Georgia a single juror can stop a death sentence from being imposed—the jury has to be unanimous—the bar is much higher for a death row inmate seeking to overturn his sentence. Fults’ legal burden was to demonstrate that no reasonable juror would have voted to give him the death penalty. And this, in the court’s view, he had not done. So how, exactly, does a “reasonable juror” think? It’s difficult to think of any decisions more subjective than who should live or die. Every death penalty state has a statute with language intended to objectify the determination, but when all is said and done, it’s highly personal: Will the person be a danger in the future? Do the circumstances of the crime trump the defendant’s background? Do the reasons for a life sentence outweigh those for a death sentence? And how might this hypothetical reasonable juror regard Kenneth Fults? The man pleaded guilty to a horrible crime. He committed two burglaries and stole some handguns, all with the intention of killing a man involved with his former girlfriend. Instead, he ended up shooting a neighbor, Cathy Bounds, five times in the back of the head. But, as the Supreme Court has pointed out, there are “potentially infinite” reasons a juror might want to sentence someone who has committed a heinous crime to something less than death. Kenneth Fults’ history was packed with them. “I just lost sight of raising my kids,” his mother, Juanita Wyatt, told a state court judge, explaining the result of her crack and alcohol addictions. She was court-martialed from the military for writing bad checks to buy drugs, moved her children from house to house and state to state, abused them with switches and belts and electrical cords—using the plug end when the cord itself ceased to have the necessary impact. Whatever boyfriend happened to be with her at the time often joined in. As for Kenneth’s father, the man was no more than a name to him. Kenneth’s mother didn’t just lose sight of raising her children—she lost sight of them entirely. His younger sister remembered how their mom had abandoned the kids after moving the family to Houston: We stayed there alone without any adults watching over us so long that the power company had turned off all the utilities. We didn’t have heat or lights; I don’t remember if we had water. I don’t remember how long we were alone…I know it was at least a couple of months. I was really scared. Kenny and Michael tried to make it like it was fun and we were just camping out or something. I know they started stealing for us to have something to eat, because we did not have any money. I also remember that Michael had them dig a hole in the ground in the backyard to bury some of our food to try and keep it cold when our electricity was turned off. Legally speaking, the most compelling reason not to sentence Fults to death is that he may be intellectually disabled. Three separate IQ tests over a 16-year period, one of them seven years prior to the murder, all fall within the range for mental retardation. By seventh grade, Fults was testing near the bottom in basic skills. In eighth, he was placed in a “special class…for slow learners.” In that class, a former teacher recalled, Kenny was the “poorest performing student.” There also was abundant testimony that he was incapable of keeping his money straight or filling out job applications. And as a child, he related to far younger children. Even Judge Jordan, in rejecting Fults’ claim of intellectual disability in the 11th Circuit, acknowledged that his lawyers’ argument was “not without some force.” But again, procedural rules came into play: Since the state court had rejected the claim, its decision was presumed correct, and only “clear and convincing” evidence could overturn it. The IQ tests, the academic struggles, the affidavits of family members and teachers and friends detailing his “slowness,” none of that was enough. As for what a reasonable juror might have done with all of this information, we’ll never know. Johnny Mostiler didn’t present any of it to the jury. Kenneth Fults has one last stop before his appeals run out. The likelihood that the US Supreme Court will review any matter is remote, but there could be a tiny sliver of hope for him in a civil case, Warger v. Shauers, that the court decided last December. On its face, the unanimous ruling seems as though it would be to Fults’ detriment: Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s majority opinion echoes what lawyer Sabrina Graham had argued on Georgia’s behalf in the Fults case: that what a juror says later cannot be used to attack the verdict. You have to read the fine print, footnote No. 3 to be exact, to find the passage that could be Fults’ saving grace: “There may be cases of juror bias so extreme that, almost by defini­tion, the jury trial right has been abridged. If and when such a case arises, the Court can consider whether the usual safeguards are or are not sufficient to protect the integrity of the process.” As much as Georgia wants to make the case about a rule of evidence, it is not really about that at all. It is, instead, about Footnote No. 3, and that most extreme form of juror bias: sentencing a man to death based on racial hostility. And maybe it’s also about how far we are willing to go, and how many procedural barriers we are willing to erect, to avoid dealing with the ramifications of such behavior. How do we know when we’ve crossed the line, when our system of justice simply can’t tolerate a result that its technical rules encourage? Here’s Buffington’s full statement: “That nigger got just what should have happened. Once he pled guilty, I knew I would vote for the death penalty because that’s what that nigger deserved.” Racism doesn’t get much clearer than that. Now it’ll be up to the Supreme Court to decide whether the rules of evidence might, just this once, take a backseat to the principle that no man should be judged by the color of his skin.

        "articles": "Robin Nelson/ZUMAPress Some conservatives are having a tough time with President Barack Obama’s reelection. Take social conservative leader Franklin Graham. In an interview with Newsmax.com, the Rev. Graham, a prominent evangelist and son of top-dog evangelist Billy Graham, maintained that Obama’s victory will put the country further along a “path of destruction.” And he suggested it would take a “complete economic collapse” to place the United States on a better course and return it to godliness. Graham equated the Obama years with a national rejection of God. “In the last four years, we have begun to turn our backs on God,” he said. “We have taken God out of our education system. We have taken him out of government. You have lawyers that sue you every time you mention the name of Jesus Christ in any kind of a public forum.” Oddly, Graham ignored the fact that he and other shepherds of the Christian right have griped about such matters for much longer than four years. It didn’t start with Obama. As Graham denounced the Obama years, Newsmax‘s Kathleen Walter asked, “So we’ve become too secular a nation? How do we bring God back into government?” Graham replied: Maybe God will have to bring our nation down to our knees—to where you just have a complete economic collapse. And maybe at that point, maybe people will again begin to call upon the name of almighty God. Economic calamity was the one option Graham mentioned—as if only such a disaster could move the United States in the right direction. Graham has been no stranger to controversy. Earlier this year, he had to apologize after questioning Obama’s faith and saying on MSNBC that the president “seems more concerned about [Muslims] than the Christians that are being murdered in the Muslim countries.” He has often decried the entire religion of Islam, at one point calling it “a very evil and wicked religion.” Two years ago, he was disinvited from the Pentagon’s National Day of Prayer event when a fuss developed over his anti-Muslim comments. In his Newsmax interview, Graham wasn’t quite advocating that God wreak total economic havoc upon the United States. But he did come close. He also noted that his father “likes the president personally.” The problem, Graham explained, is that “the radical left” has “taken over the White House.” Despite his harsh feelings concerning Obama’s leadership, Graham said God commands him and Christians to “pray for those in authority.” Consequently, he said, “I would encourage everyone to pray for the president…We need to bathe him prayer”—presumably, before the final (economic) days come.

        "articles": "John Moore/Getty Images Over the past two years, the Trump administration has made illegal immigration a top priority, but, much more quietly, it has also been making it increasingly difficult for immigrants to be in the US legally. Now, a small rule change is set to take effect Monday that targets some of the most vulnerable immigrants in the country: survivors of human trafficking, domestic violence, and other crimes. These groups of people typically apply for two kinds of humanitarian relief visas—the U and T visas—that require individuals to cooperate with US law enforcement in investigating certain crimes. But now, when applying for these legal protections, these men and women will face a much greater risk of deportation. Back in July, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency tasked with processing visas and other immigration benefits, released a policy broadening its ability to issue a Notice to Appear (NTA), a document that orders an immigrant to appear before a judge and begins deportation proceedings. As I reported previously, this change made it easier for USCIS to issue an NTA whenever someone applied for a change in benefits—like citizenship, or a green card—and was denied and lacked another legal status. Traditionally, USCIS only issued NTAs in limited circumstances, such as when an applicant was found to have committed a substantial level of fraud, and the agency referred most cases they denied to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which would investigate. ICE then issued the majority of NTAs. As I wrote this summer after the policy was first revealed: The new memo gives USCIS officials the power to directly issue an NTA in a broader range of circumstances, including if they find evidence of a criminal offense or fraud in an applicant’s history, or if a case is denied and the applicant is found to be unlawfully present in the United States—a scenario that alarms many immigration advocates. … While seemingly small changes, these policies could have widespread implications, potentially sending far more immigrants into removal proceedings and increasing the number of cases in an already backlogged immigration court system, according to experts who spoke to Mother Jones. The NTA guidance alone could threaten the tens of thousands of immigrants who apply for benefits each year, such as work visas or green cards. Previously, if their application for a benefit was denied, immigrants would have the chance to appeal the decision, try again, or voluntarily depart the country if they no longer had a valid immigration status. Now, if an application is denied and the applicant loses their immigration status in the process, they could be considered “unlawfully present” and placed into removal proceedings. The changes would affect both undocumented immigrants and those who are already legally in the country. When USCIS first announced the guidance over the summer, it was unclear exactly how the agency would implement it. Immigration advocates were especially concerned about how it would impact these humanitarian relief visas. While at least 15,000 U and T visas are allocated each year, thousands more apply; between October 2017 and June 2018, USCIS received nearly 46,000 applications for U visas, and a little more than 2,000 applications for T visas. Now, according to an update USCIS released earlier this month, immigrants applying for these two kinds of visas, U and T, as well as three other kinds of humanitarian relief visas, could be more easily placed in deportation proceedings if their applications are denied and they do not have an underlying legal status. In addition to these crime survivors, other groups that would be affected include relatives of asylum seekers, young immigrants requesting the protection of a juvenile court, and women seeking protection under the Violence Against Women Act. (It’s important to note that the NTA guidance does not affect individuals applying for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or Temporary Protected Status.) “In effect, USCIS could throw survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking into deportation proceedings for the very act of seeking protection from their abusers and captors,” says Jason Boyd, policy counsel at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “It’s a morally reprehensible policy. Without question, this policy will deter survivors of human trafficking, domestic abuse, sexual assault and other horrific crimes from coming forward.” The change could have far-reaching consequences, and not just for the immigrants themselves, notes Archi Pyati, chief of policy at the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit that helps immigrant women and girls fleeing gender-based violence. Congress explicitly created some of these visas with the hope that offering immigrants legal protection and status would encourage them to report crimes and cooperate with police or federal investigators. “Law enforcement across the country have spoken to the importance of community policing and working with immigrant communities to enforce the law,” says Pyati. But now, “if immigrants are afraid to cooperate—because they’re afraid of deportation—officers’ hands are often tied.” In its update, USCIS says that it will ensure applicants receive denial letters with “adequate notice” of how much longer they would be authorized to stay in the US, and when they should leave, so that no one would be in immediate danger of getting deported. Agency spokesman Michael Bars wrote in a statement to Mother Jones that the agency expects individuals to return to their countries once they no longer have legal status, but he noted that they do have the opportunity to appeal USCIS’ decision. “Importantly, individuals who apply for benefits, continue to have rights to appeal negative decisions on their applications and petitions,” Bars writes in his statement. “Ensuring that individuals who are subject to removal are placed in proceedings is fidelity to the law.” In a teleconference for stakeholders last Thursday, USCIS said that it will begin applying the NTA policy towards employment-based applications in the future, though it’s unclear when it would begin implementing this policy. These changes to how NTAs are issued, while seemingly small, continue a troubling trend of USCIS picking up far more enforcement duties than it has in the past, says Boyd. “This policy epitomizes USCIS’ ongoing transformation from the service-oriented, benefits agency that Congress intended into another immigration enforcement arm of DHS,” he says.

        "articles": "Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty has struggled to distance himself from his old, reality based views on climate change.<a  Skidmore</a>/Flickr Thursday night’s Republican debate was worth watching if only to see Tim Pawlenty try to talk his way around his previous support for efforts to cut planet-warming emissions. As governor of Minnesota, Pawlenty not only acknowledged that climate change is a problem, but also endorsed a cap-and-trade plan to deal with it. That makes him something of a pariah among other Republicans these days. In a very “This is Your Life” moment, the Fox debate hosts replayed a 2007 ad that Pawlenty recorded for the Environmental Defense Fund in which he argues for cap and trade as a solution for climate change. When asked to discuss the ad, Pawlenty abashedly replied, “Do we have to?” After trying to explain that he didn’t actually support cap and trade policy as governor—he just supported the “study” of it—Pawlenty decided to try apologizing: “I’ve said I was wrong. It was a mistake, and I’m sorry,” Mr. Pawlenty told the Fox television audience, presumably filled with potential Republican primary voters. “You’re going to have a few clunkers in your record, and we all do, and that’s one of mine. I just admit it. I don’t try to duck it, bob it, weave it, try to explain it away. I’m just telling you, I made a mistake.” Pawlenty has apologized for this before. In March, he told conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham that his support for cap-and-trade was a mistake and pointed to other Republican 2012 hopefuls who made similar “mistakes.” Pawlenty’s flip-flop on climate is probably the most damning among the viable contenders for 2012. He formed the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group as governor to study the impacts of global warming and make policy recommendations. (He later ignored those recommendations.) He was also at the forefront of the effort to get the Midwest Governors Association to sign onto the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord. He was even best buddies with a famed Arctic explorer and climate activist. Pawlenty has been trying to talk his way out of all this ever since he signaled he is running for the Republican nomination. Last night probably didn’t do much to end the questions.

        "articles": "Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli at the Values Voters Summit in 2011<a  target=\"_blank\">Flickr/Gage Skidmore</a> The campaign of Virginia state attorney general Ken Cuccinelli won’t say if he’s committed any crimes against nature. Cuccinelli, who is running to be Virginia’s next governor, recently petitioned a federal court to reverse its ruling that the state’s archaic “Crimes Against Nature” law is unconstitutional. That statute outlaws oral and anal sex between consenting adults—gay or straight, married or single—making such “carnal” acts a felony. The law is unconstitutional because of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, which invalidated such “anti-sodomy laws” across the country. As my colleague Kate Sheppard notes, Cuccinelli’s office claims that it is appealing the decision because the state’s regular statutory rape law doesn’t allow it to pursue the harshest punishment against a 47-year-old man who solicited oral sex from teenagers (who were above the age of consent at the time). But as Josh Israel recounts at ThinkProgress, Cuccinelli helped kill an effort to reform the Crimes Against Nature law in order to make it comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Lawrence, possibly because the proposed law didn’t focus on homosexuality. “My view is that homosexual acts, not homosexuality, but homosexual acts are wrong,” Cuccinelli said in 2009. “They’re intrinsically wrong. And I think in a natural law-based country it’s appropriate to have policies that reflect that…They don’t comport with natural law.” If Virginia’s ban on “unnatural” sex acts applied nationwide, the Virginia law would make 90 percent of men and women in the United States between the age of 25 and 44 criminals. Here’s a chart from the National Center on Health Statistics on sexual behavior in the US: Violating Virginia’s Crimes Against Nature statute was a class six felony in the state, and carried a penalty of between one and five years in prison. The Virginia Department of Corrections only has a capacity of around 30,000. Given that 64.6 percent of Virginia’s 8 million residents are between the ages of 18 and 65, the state most likely lacks the prison capacity to house millions of Virginians who, in Cuccinelli’s view, have committed crimes against nature. But what about Cuccinelli and his aides? Mother Jones asked his campaign if Cuccinelli or anyone working for his campaign had ever engaged in any of the prohibited conduct and whether Cuccinelli would fire any campaign staff who had done so. We have received no response. But if Cuccinelli’s campaign is being run by criminals against nature, don’t the voters have a right to know?

        "articles": "<a  Benedict/PBS NewsHour</a>/Flickr Since undercover videos that captured Planned Parenthood staff discussing fetal tissue donations were released last month, GOP officials in more than 10 states have clamored to launch investigations into the organization. On Tuesday, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley joined that group, ordering her state’s health department to review the policies and practices of all abortion clinics in the state, including the three operated by Planned Parenthood. “These practices are not consistent with the laws or character of our state,” Haley wrote in her letter to the state agency tasked with regulating abortion clinics, adding that it “cannot allow an organization with broken internal oversight and a flawed corporate culture to behave the way Planned Parenthood has in other states.” In the videos, recorded surreptitiously and released by the anti-abortion group Center for Medical Progress, Planned Parenthood officials talk frankly about the organization’s tissue donation program and the costs associated with donating fetal tissue from an abortion. Though fetal tissue donation is a long-standing and legal practice in the United States, and has contributed to medical advancements like the polio vaccine, conservatives have used the videos to attack the health care organization, saying they provide evidence that Planned Parenthood illegally profits from the sale of aborted fetuses. And they’ve pushed for investigations to unmask this purported criminal wrongdoing. But so far, those investigations are falling flat. Completed probes in Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, and South Dakota have spent thousands in taxpayer money but turned up no evidence that Planned Parenthood is trafficking in the sale of fetal tissue. And in most of the other states that have launched investigations—including Ohio, Arizona, Texas, and Kansas—Planned Parenthood affiliates don’t even have fetal tissue donation programs, making it hard to believe the states will find any illegal activity related to the practice. In Louisiana, where Gov. Bobby Jindal ordered an investigation in mid-July, Planned Parenthood does not even operate a single abortion clinic. “In every state where these investigations have concluded, officials have cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing,” Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation, told the Huffington Post. “We’ve said all along that Planned Parenthood follows all laws and has very high medical standards, and that’s what every one of these investigations has found.” Not every governor has taken the bait. Democratic governors in Minnesota and Virginia have rejected state legislators’ pleas to look into the group, saying they won’t waste time investigating programs that don’t exist in their states. “As far as I’m concerned, there’s no basis for an investigation at taxpayer expense into a private nonprofit organization that has stated they don’t engage in those practices,” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton told local reporters after he received a letter from GOP lawmakers asking him to take action. Other states have taken another approach since the release of the videos: Governors in Alabama and Arkansas, along with Louisiana’s Jindal, have moved to block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, which they may not be able to do under federal law. Meanwhile, public opinion of the organization remains high. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that despite weeks of bad news, Planned Parenthood is still more popular than every major 2016 presidential contender, the NRA, and the Supreme Court.

        "articles": "Mac McClelland Editors’ note: Mac is spending a month in her home state of Ohio, reporting on the Wisconsin-style showdown involving Republican Gov. John Kasich, public employees, unions, teachers, students, and struggling middle-class families. It’s always something in Ohio. Last week, it became legal to bring concealed weapons into bars. A labor protest shut down a busy street in downtown Columbus. And the hotly contested, penny-pinching budget was signed into law by Gov. John Kasich. For the friends I’ve been staying with, the impending budget has been wreaking havoc on domestic tranquility. First, Anthony got laid off because the budget was slated to cut so much from his employer, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel. Then, the family got the news that the OCC cut wasn’t going to be quite as bad as anticipated. So now, though many of his coworkers are still out of a job, Anthony’s is safe. The concern has shifted mostly onto Erin, a public school teacher. Here’s what’s troublesome for her in the budget: a requirement that schools receiving federal Race to the Top grants ditch their longstanding experience- and education-based pay system in favor of an alternative, like merit-based pay. Erin’s school is a Race to the Top school. While she signed on to her job with the impression that her future salary level would be guaranteed by a predetermined schedule, this provision means cash-strapped school administrators could decide that, based on some as-yet-to-be-determined criteria, her salary should be $10,000 or $20,000 less than it currently is. Normally, Erin’s union could likely prevent any arbitrary salary changes or advocate on her behalf. But the Ohio legislature recently passed Senate Bill 5, a Wisconsin-y anti-collective-bargaining law that will render her union effectively powerless. That was the subject of last week’s protest. Almost as soon as SB 5 passed, opponents started gathering signatures to get a repeal measure on the November ballot. Last Wednesday, huge crowds gathered in downtown Columbus to march to the secretary of state’s office and deliver those signatures. Shirts and flags identified them as firefighters, transit workers, teachers, electricians, bikers, state troopers; residents of Columbus, Cleveland, Findlay, Toledo; members of the SEIU, UAW, AFL-CIO. There was a professional drumline. There was the mayor, whom Erin nearly ran down with her unwieldy stroller when she veered toward him to shake his hand. The organizers needed about 230,000 to get the SB 5 repeal on the ballot. They got 1,298,301. “We can’t guarantee anything,” said a spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, the campaign driving the effort, “but we’re confident with the amount of signatures we’ve collected that we have a lot of support on our side.” Erin hopes they’re right. She’s nervous about it, though. So is Lindsey, another gal who lived in our dorm when we all went to Ohio State 10 years ago. Lindsey teaches middle-school English in rural Logan, about an hour outside Columbus. She stopped by for a visit the other day, bringing one of her kids, her two-month-old, to meet Erin’s eleven-month-old. Most of the talk that wasn’t about breast-feeding was about SB 5. Though Lindsey doesn’t teach at a Race to the Top school, under the new legislation her district can opt out of its established pay schedule. And with union protections in jeopardy, she’s not taking any chances. “My husband wants to buy a new couch,” she said. But—she cocked her head and winced hard—she doesn’t want to take any money out of their savings until the repeal passes (or not) this fall. “We don’t know what’s gonna happen.” Front page image by ProgressOhio/Flickr Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "The last couple of months have been rough for proponents of open-carry gun laws. No fewer than seven restaurant chains have taken a stand against firearms being brought to their businesses, after activists in Texas conducted provocative demonstrations in which they toted semi-automatic rifles into various eateries. Texas law allows rifles (though not handguns) to be carried on display in public, but some patrons and employees were unnerved and angered by the demonstrations, and a national group advocating for reforms, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, pressured the companies using social-media campaigns. After Mother Jones published videos of the gun activists in action, Sonic and Chili’s Grill & Bar became the latest to officially reject guns on their premises. There has also been a particularly dark side to the story of the gun activists: As I first reported in mid May, members of Open Carry Texas and their allies have used vicious tactics against people who disagree with them, including bullying and degrading women. Just last week they harassed a Marine veteran, pursuing him through the streets of Fort Worth on Memorial Day. Evidently the National Rifle Association has come to realize that none of this is good for business. In an extraordinary move on Friday, the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action—the organization’s powerful lobbying arm in Washington—issued a lengthy statement seeking to distinguish between “responsible behavior” and “legal mandates.” It told the Texas gun activists in no uncertain terms to stand down. [Also see update below.] “As gun owners, whether or not our decisions are dictated by the law, we are still accountable for them,” the statement began. “If we exercise poor judgment, our decisions will have consequences…such as turning an undecided voter into an antigun voter because of causing that person fear or offense.” The NRA praised the “robust gun culture” of Texas—a state that has loosened laws as aggressively as any recently—but then laid into those Texans “who have crossed the line from enthusiasm to downright foolishness.” Recently, demonstrators have been showing up in various public places, including coffee shops and fast food restaurants, openly toting a variety of tactical long guns. Unlicensed open carry of handguns is legal in about half the U.S. states, and it is relatively common and uncontroversial in some places. Yet while unlicensed open carry of long guns is also typically legal in most places, it is a rare sight to see someone sidle up next to you in line for lunch with a 7.62 rifle slung across his chest, much less a whole gaggle of folks descending on the same public venue with similar arms. Let’s not mince words, not only is it rare, it’s downright weird and certainly not a practical way to go normally about your business while being prepared to defend yourself. To those who are not acquainted with the dubious practice of using public displays of firearms as a means to draw attention to oneself or one’s cause, it can be downright scary. It makes folks who might normally be perfectly open-minded about firearms feel uncomfortable and question the motives of pro-gun advocates. The problem has been on the NRA’s radar at least since April. In a roundtable discussion hosted by a Texas podcaster on April 28, Charles Cotton, a long-serving member of the NRA board of directors based in Houston, and Alice Tripp, lobbyist and legislative director for the Texas State Rifle Association (TSRA), squared off with CJ Grisham, the founder and president of Open Carry Texas. Cotton and Tripp, who have both been deeply involved in passing pro-gun laws in Texas for many years, warned Grisham that his group’s demonstrations were causing them major grief with their allies in the capitol. “We do control a massive number of votes,” Cotton pointed out. “I’m in the capitol three times a week,” Tripp added. “Every [lawmaker’s] office I went into today asked me, ‘Can’t you do something to stop the rifle demonstrations?'” One lawmaker told Tripp that he’d gotten a phone call from the Republican mayor of Arlington—the site of several provocative open-carry incidents—who’d been “absolutely incensed.” The demonstrations were seriously harming the overall mission to ease gun laws further, she said. Grisham, whose group sees its demonstrations as a means to legalizing the open carrying of handguns in Texas, was having none of it. “I would like to vehemently disagree,” he said. He went off about “the two major foes” of his organization, the “ultraliberal gun control bullies” of Moms Demand Action—and gun rights defenders who don’t go far enough. “When you’ve got the TSRA and the NRA basically coming down on us for standing up for our rights, that’s where our problem is,” he said. “Because now you guys are siding with Moms Demand Action.” “CJ, when you make a statement like, ‘We align ourselves with Moms Who Demand Action,’ or whatever the hell their name is, those are fighting words,” Cotton replied with growing exasperation. “You alienate the people that can get this done.” He continued: “The New Black Panthers did exactly what you folks are doing. They marched on the convention center during the Republican convention here in Houston [with] their rifles and shotguns…No arrests were made, but the legislative response was, ‘We’re going to stop this.'” State law was watered down in the next session as a result, Cotton said, freeing local governments to ban the possession of firearms under some circumstances. “They might not like our methods, but our methods are working,” Grisham told me in a recent conversation with regard to the NRA’s pushback. “We’re out there educating people on the street. We’re showing them firsthand that you can see a gun out on the street or at a restaurant and it’s not going to shoot you. I’m not going to let Open Carry Texas be beholden to anyone that doesn’t get our mission.” For the NRA, furthering its agenda in state capitols may not be the biggest concern at this point. In light of the recent corporate backlash, Slate‘s Dahlia Lithwick proposed late last week that the war over gun policy may now be fought more in the crucible of the free market. The battleground has grown to include retailers: An open-carry rally at a Home Depot in suburban Fort Worth on Saturday drew roughly 150 armed citizens as well as some withering criticism, according to the Dallas Morning News. Home Depot, whose owner is deeply conservative, signaled that it was fine with the demonstration. But other corporations are growing nervous and moving proactively to prevent gun activists from putting their brands in the crosshairs, says Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action. A large restaurant chain and a major retailer, she told me, “have reached out to us to discuss what policies they could put in place to keep gun extremists out of their businesses.” (She asked that the two companies not be identified due to the sensitivity of the discussions.) “Gun extremists believe that when a company is silent they tacitly support open carry, which clearly isn’t the case.” It may be that a broader cultural shift—or at least a strategic one—is stirring within the gun lobby. In its statement on Friday, the NRA also cracked open the door to so-called “smart guns,” which aim to improve safety through innovative technological features. Historically the NRA has vigorously opposed them as yet another catalyst for dubious government overreach, but now says: “In principle, the idea would seem to have merit, at least in some circumstances.” That pivot comes not long after a businesswoman in California and a gun dealer in Maryland spoke out about harassment and death threats for trying to sell the cutting-edge weapons. The NRA has also backtracked recently from its long-held stance against laws meant to disarm domestic abusers—a major factor in gun violence against women—by quietly supporting recent such legislation in states including Wisconsin and Minnesota. The NRA’s ability to wield outsize political control may now be starting to change, too—at least with some of the hardcore base to which it has long catered. On Sunday, Open Carry Texas dismissed the criticism of its tactics: “The NRA has lost its relevance and sided with the gun control extremists and their lapdog media,” the group tweeted, adding, “We don’t fight for rights at the discretion of the NRA.” Update June 3, 2014, 7:15pmEDT: The NRA is now beating a retreat from its condemnation of the Texas activists. Timothy Johnson of Media Matters for America reports that the NRA’s top lobbyist Chris Cox appeared on a NRA radio show on Tuesday to apologize for and repudiate the NRA’s lenghty post criticizing the open carry movement: “Cox said that the statement was ‘a mistake’ and that ‘it shouldn’t have happened,’ adding ‘our job is not to criticize the lawful behavior of fellow gun owners.’ Cox also blamed the statement on a ‘staffer’ who Cox said ‘expressed his personal opinion.'” That’s an intriguing explanation given that the piece appearing on the NRA-ILA’s “News & Issues” page was 1,500 words long, contained links to an array of research, and had no byline on it. Eric Lach at Talking Points Memo has more on the Texas activists’ angry response to the NRA’s Friday post, which apparently prompted the organization to rethink things. On the radio broadcast Cox went on to emphasize what he said was his organization’s official policy: “The National Rifle Association unapologetically and unflinchingly supports the right of self-defense and what that means is that our members and our supporters have a right to carry a firearm in any place they have a legal right to be. If that means open carry, we support open carry.” Update June 4, 2014, 12:30amEDT: The Texas activists welcomed the NRA’s about-face: “Open Carry Texas would like to both thank and applaud Chris Cox and the National Rifle Association for clarification on their stance of open carry,” the group said in a post on Facebook. “We remain confident that the NRA will aid with legislative support to help in getting an open carry bill [for handguns] both drafted and passed in the 2015 legislative session.” Said one commenter: “So, folks aren’t recommending they cut up their NRA cards and mail them in anymore?” For more of Mother Jones’ award-winning investigative reporting on guns in America, see all of our latest coverage here, and our special reports.

        "articles": "Ever since the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial was unveiled last year, it’s been lambasted for paraphrasing a famous quote of King’s on its north side. The Washington Post explains: Imagining his eulogy, King used the conditional tense: “If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter.” But after the architect and the sculptor thought the stone would look better with fewer words, a shortened version was put on, composed of just 10 words with a heavy staccato beat. It was no longer a conditional statement; it was a flat assertion: “I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness.” Today, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar ordered the quotation to be corrected, but ever since I first heard about this I wondered just why the quote had to be so badly shortened in the first place. Did the original really not fit? That’s ultimately an aesthetic judgment, since obviously the carved letters could be made small enough to make room for just about anything. But what if the letterforms were roughly the same size as the ones currently on the monument? As a public service, the photoshopped image below shows what it would look like — though I still had to chop off the final sentence to get it all in. Now you can decide for yourself.

        "articles": "Any book review that starts like this is probably worth reading: I suppose we should be grateful to Linda Killian. Her new book collects in one place every clichéd and suspect empirical generalization about political independents. So in that sense—and only in that sense—it is a useful volume. That’s from Ruy Teixeira. His simple point is one that regular readers will be familiar with: most “independent” voters are actually pretty partisan. Indies who lean Democratic vote Democratic and indies who lean Republican vote Republican. They’re just about as reliable in their voting patterns as actual Democrats and Republicans. This has long been common knowledge among political scientists who actually look at voting data. But what about the folks who don’t lean at all? Yet the “independent” group does include one sub-group whose members look and act more like swing voters. This is the so-called pure independents subgroup, those who say they do not lean toward either party. In 2008, they split their vote much more evenly between the parties—51-41 for Obama—and they have policy views that are not closely aligned with either party. But this is a small group, and because it tends to show low information, low involvement, and relatively low turnout, it is even smaller in the context of an actual election. In 2008, according to the NES, they were just 7 percent of all voters and only 20 percent of nominally independent voters. Independent voters aren’t entirely a myth, but they’re surely an endangered species. There just aren’t as many of these fabled creatures as the mainstream press endlessly suggests. Like it or not, we’re a partisan country. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "articles": "Zuma/Louie Palu As lawmakers work to negotiate a grand bargain on the federal budget, top Senate Democrats hosted a conference call with reporters to insist that they won’t let social issues derail a deal to keep the government—and the still-nascent economic recovery—going. The watchword of the day is “rider,” a term used to describe provisions tacked on to government funding bills that restrict how money can be spent. House Republicans wedged plenty of riders into their budget proposal, but some—including provisions to ban funding for Planned Parenthood and restrict the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases—are particularly galling to Democrats, who still control two-thirds of the government. Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the Senate majority leader, also criticized the GOP’s cuts to Title X funding, which supports contraception and other health services for low-income women, and cuts to the Head Start program, which funds education programs for low-income families. “This should be the kind of thing upon which reasonable people can agree—that this is not the right thing to do,” Reid said. “It’s certainly not something over which it’s worth shutting down the government.” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) echoed Reid: “Please don’t let the ship of state crash over riders…. let’s not shut down the government on a fight over some bumper sticker issue that may have been around for the last ten or twenty years.” Durbin acknowledged that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is stuck been a rock and a hard-charging, aggressive tea party. But Durbin said he also remains confident that the speaker understands the devastating implications of closing down the government. During the last shutdown, over $3 billion of exports sat idle in ports, according to Reid. “We’re calling on speaker Boehner to sit down and in good faith work with us. We’ve agreed on the number,” Durbin said, referring to the $73 billion in spending cuts for the 2011 budget negotiated by Vice President Joe Biden earlier this week. “Now it’s a matter of putting together the cuts that will achieve our goals of reducing spending in a responsible way.” If Boehner can do that, then he’s sure to find friends on the other side of the aisle, Durbin promised. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also weighed in on Boehner’s intra-party dilemma. “We’re on the doorstep of a deal as long as the Speaker resists the tea party Republicans in the House,” he said. Because Boehner has been boxed in by the tea party, Schumer added, the Speaker will need the support of Democrats, and must look to make cuts to mandatory rather than domestic discretionary spending. “We’re going to insist that mandatory savings be part of any deal. Because otherwise the cuts become so deep on certain programs that they cut in the bone.” Meanwhile, Reid said that the Democrats have found an unlikely ally in their fight to keep the government open: the Republican-leaning US Chamber of Commerce. Reid said that Chamber president Tom Donohue told a gathering of over 100 Republicans yesterday that they would be making a huge mistake shutting down the government. And the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs of major U.S. corporations, warned that a government shutdown would kill the momentum the private sector has gained in recent months. “You can’t balance this budget… on the backs of people who had nothing to do with the debt,” Reid said. “They had nothing to do with making the debt what it is. And they shouldn’t be the only answer to it.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

        "urls": "http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/newt-gingrich-john-hagee",
        "articles": "Gary Coronado/Zuma When Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) accepted the endorsement of Texas megachurch pastor John Hagee in 2008, the result was a PR disaster. After critics pointed to Hagee’s incendiary views on gays (whom he held responsible for Hurricane Katrina) and Catholicism (which he described as a “false cult“), the Arizona Republican called Hagee’s views “crazy and unacceptable” and renounced the endorsement. But three years later, Hagee is once more involved in Republican presidential politics. Later this month, he’ll host former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a 2012 aspirant, at Cornerstone Church in San Antonio. For the candidate and the pastor, the summit is a chance for two controversial figures to help each other back into the spotlight—though a Hagee spokesman says the pastor has no plans to endorse Gingrich. “Every so often [Hagee] pops up like a Whac-A-Mole and then goes away again,” says Chris Korzen, executive director of Catholics United, who was part of the anti-Hagee choir three years ago. “Why does someone like Newt Gingrich feel like he has to have a public association with this person? Clearly it’s about politics.” After the 2008 endorsement controversy died down, a longtime Karl Rove ally, Deal Hudson, helped to make peace between Hagee and his loudest conservative critic, Catholic League President Bill Donohue. Hudson, who chaired George W. Bush’s Catholic outreach efforts in 2000 and 2004 before taking a similar role with McCain, reached out to both Hagee and Donohue. A former Southern Baptist, Hudson met with Hagee and gave him a collection of books about Catholicism. A few months later, and after a brief correspondence with Donohue, Hagee and his wife showed up at the Catholic League’s offices for a meeting to clear the air. Donohue, who called Hagee “an inveterate bigot” three years ago, now says there’s no longer any bad blood between the two camps. “As far as I’m concerned, Hagee and I are on friendly terms today,” he remarks. “We had a very straight man-to-man talk on things. I’m convinced that he turned the corner.” Donohue says Hagee apologized, and that the pastor and his followers have toned down their rhetoric—at least in regards to Catholicism—over the last two-and-a-half years. Hagee, for his part, has maintained that the whole flap was based mostly on a misunderstanding, stating that he had called historic anti-Semitism—and not the Catholic Church—a “false cult.” “There may still be some people who believe some of the lies that were told about me during the campaign,” Hagee explained in a 2009 interview. “But I’ve come to believe that those who readily accepted these smears were probably not my friends to begin with.” The pastor’s history of incendiary comments meshes with his unique brand of Christian Zionism. He’s warned, for instance, that the anti-Christ would be, gay, part Jewish, and president of the European Union. In his book, Jerusalem Countdown, he writes, “[M]ost readers will be shocked by the clear record of history linking Adolf Hitler and the Roman Catholic Church in a conspiracy to exterminate the Jews.” (He has since apologized, acknowledging that there were “thousands of righteous Catholics…who risked their lives to save Jews from the Holocaust.”) Hagee and his supporters—like Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League—contend that his most inflammatory remarks have been taken out of context. He’s stated that his remarks on Katrina weren’t meant to imply cause and effect. (He said the hurricane was “the judgment of God against the city of New Orleans,” which “had a level of sin that was offensive to God.” He then pointed out that “there was to be a homosexual parade there on the Monday that the Katrina came.”) Hagee has also emphasized that his hawkish foreign policy and end-times theology are mutually exclusive, because “humans are utterly powerless to change God’s timetable.” For Gingrich, who converted to Catholicism in 2009, the upcoming meeting with Hagee is an opportunity to court evangelicals while playing up his neoconservative credentials. Hagee is the founder of Christians United for Israel, a hawkish organization that has pushed for the US to consider military strikes against Iran.* But the Gingrich-Hagee tête-à-tête also underscores the problems the twice-divorced candidate faces with the GOP’s social conservative base. Hagee’s a polarizing figure even on the right, and given his past, he’s not the kind of person you reach out to unless you really need to. (Gingrich’s spokesman did not return calls for comment.) “He’s controversial as an evangelical,” says Mark Silk, a professor at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, who writes frequently about Catholic politics. “Theologically, [Hagee is] a dubious character; he’s regarded as not one of the gang. It’s hard for me to see that it gets [Gingrich] any street cred from anybody.” John C. Green, a senior research adviser at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, agrees. “My sense is that Rev. Hagee’s public influence in Republican presidential politics has been substantially diminished because of the events of the 2008 campaign,” he explains in an email. “Few GOP candidates will want to be publicly associated with him.” Gingrich’s summit with the controversial religious leader comes as he struggles for support among members of his own faith. According to a recent survey by the evangelical Barna Research Group, just 27 percent of Catholics have a favorable opinion of Gingrich, while 46 percent have unfavorable views. The numbers for former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, a Mormon, and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, a onetime Baptist preacher, by contrast, were nearly reversed. Donohue, for one, has his doubts about Gingrich’s bona fides. “Newt’s got some baggage, both in terms of the professional—the ethics questions—and the personal. There is the lingering suspicion: Anybody can fall once, but when it becomes somebody like Plaxico Burress or Roger Clemens, it starts to get old,” he says, alluding to Gingrich’s history of infidelity, and two professional athletes whose serial misdeeds landed them in legal trouble. Three years ago, McCain’s embrace of Hagee boomeranged because everyone wanted to talk about it. What was meant to be a dog whistle—a signal meant to be heard only by social conservatives—mushroomed into a full-fledged controversy. But for Gingrich, the lack of much reaction (so far) to his rendezvous with Hagee might be a troubling sign. As Silk puts it, “It’s too early in the cycle for anyone to get excited about anybody who’s such an also-ran getting involved with anybody who’s also old news.” *Correction: This section has been updated to clarify that CUFI has called for the consideration of strikes, rather than immediate action.

Also on Thursday, NBC resurfaced another vintage interview where Trump called pregnancy an “inconvenience” to businesses. Anyone sensing a pattern?

        "articles": "Karl Smith says lefty intellectuals have a problem dealing with bullshit. Case in point: Mark Zandi spending several hundred words this week demonstrating, yet again, that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac weren’t responsible for the 2008 financial meltdown: Mark, Mark. Clonazepam. It’s a beautiful thing. Let go. I am betting that maybe five people in the US actually believe Fannie and Freddie caused the housing bubble. Maybe half a dozen more are actively lying about it. The rest are just Bullshitting. That is, they don’t really care what the truth is one way or the other. This is just a way to gesture in the general direction of the federal government and say Urrhh!!! Ah, but what’s the proper response to bullshit? Karl is almost certainly right that among actual conservative economists, only a few actually believe that Fannie and Freddie played a big role in the financial collapse. But those few true believers have a significant effect on: Does Mark Zandi know this? Of course he does. He’s not an idiot. But what’s the proper response? If you ignore the bullshitters, then the anti-GSE narrative gets set in stone whether or not it’s bullshit. If you fight it, at least it remains fluid for a while — possibly long enough for things to settle down. So sure, it’s kabuki. All of us who write about politics for a living understand that 90% (at least) of what we do is just shadow boxing. Controversies are invented, then debunked, then invented all over again, and debunked. Sometimes the inventors know perfectly well what they’re doing, while other times they’ve talked themselves into actually believing their own nonsense. In either case, these things are mostly just proxies for the issues that really matter. But so what? The Reichstag fire was wholly invented too, and look what happened after that. As demeaning as it is, fighting back against bullshit is every bit as important as fighting back against the real stuff.
