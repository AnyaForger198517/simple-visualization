        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, just announced that public hearings in the impeachment inquiry will begin next week, allowing us to hear in their own words the accounts of diplomats, national security professionals and Trump aides (the ones who won’t disobey subpoenas, that is) about what they saw, heard and knew about the Ukraine scandal. There is one person who perhaps more than any other we ought to hear from, though the chances that he’d appear are small, if he knows what’s good for him: Rudolph W. Giuliani. Even with Rudy keeping his mouth uncharacteristically closed in recent weeks, the picture other people have painted shows that the initial impression many of us had about his involvement in this whole mess was inaccurate. Rudy did not “go rogue” as some would have it. He was not freelancing, or throwing around President Trump’s name to get what he wanted. In fact, people throughout the foreign policy and national security apparatus in the Trump administration seem to not only have been aware of the shadow Ukraine policy Giuliani was spearheading, they changed their own behavior to accommodate it. We should remind ourselves how shocking this is. The president’s “personal lawyer” does not get to jet around the world making foreign policy while ordering government officials to do his bidding. He just doesn’t. That’s not how it works. But that’s exactly what he was doing. Giuliani appeared to have two sets of goals: coercing the Ukrainian government into taking action that would benefit Trump’s reelection bid, and scooping up gobs of cash for himself and his goons Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who are currently enjoying the hospitality of the Bureau of Prisons. Giuliani’s involvement in this scandal first came to wide public attention with this New York Times article on May 9. Both Giuliani and the article itself characterized his activities as kind of an extragovernmental operation that was just about Trump’s private interests. “My only client is the president of the United States,” Giuliani said. But that was completely misleading. In fact, as Giuliani would say months later in his own defense, he was working closely with the State Department. Which is just the problem. Let’s run through some of what we’ve learned from the testimony that has already been released: It’s obviously imperative that Giuliani answer questions under oath about his role in this scandal. If he wants to assert his Fifth Amendment rights to stay silent, that’s his prerogative. What he can’t do, however, is claim that any of this is covered by attorney-client privilege; that privilege would only apply to legal advice he gives a client, and none of this qualifies. Nor can he assert executive privilege, since that only applies to people with official government roles. But it would be a shock if he talks. Rudy knows what the boss thinks of snitches.

        "articles": "A federal appeals court panel has given a thumbs-up to licensed handgun sales for a cohort of individuals, aged 18 to 20, who are vastly more likely to use them to commit murder than older adults. In doing so, it shrugged off public safety concerns and brushed aside the legislative prerogatives of Congress, which mandated a legal age of 21 to purchase handguns from licensed dealers more than a half-century ago. That act of judicial arrogance, if affirmed on appeal, would likely accelerate the current spike in homicides, many of them committed with handguns by individuals under the age of 21. And it comes as Americans are embarked on a record-setting gun-buying spree, which began during the pandemic and shows no sign of waning. The split decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit also ignored the Supreme Court’s own decision in the landmark Heller case, from 2008. While the court overturned the District of Columbia’s restrictions on handguns in private homes, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, stressed that laws limiting firearms possession, for example by people deemed dangerous or “in sensitive places such as schools,” are legitimate for public safety. That distinction was lost in the 4th Circuit’s 2-to-1 ruling, which declared, “We refuse to relegate either the Second Amendment or 18-to-20-year-olds to second-class status.” Of course, most states forbid individuals under the age of 21 from purchasing alcohol, and many ban them from buying tobacco, without grandiose huffing and puffing about relegating young adults to “second-class status.” Those laws stand, with little controversy, because they protect the public from known risks. As for the Second Amendment, the dissenting judge, James A. Wynn Jr., had it right in writing that in a country where gun owners “may conceal their weapons, carry them openly, or ‘stand their ground,’ and where civilian gun ownership rates are second to none, the majority’s second-class status concern is simply surreal.” Equally surreal is the court’s rationale that the ban is unconstitutional because teenagers were often required to serve in militias, and bring their own guns, at the time the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791. That’s a tortured standard of relevance given that armed militias, except those organized by states under their own authority, are no longer invested with law-enforcement or security powers like those the Founding Fathers had in mind — or even, in many states, legal. What’s more germane is that arrest rates for violent crimes tend to peak around age 18, and, in 2016, nearly half of all gun murders were committed by perpetrators in their teens and early 20s — even though that group represented less than 18 percent of the U.S. population. That correlation between violent crime and the youngest adults impelled Congress, in 1968, to ban the sale of handguns by licensed dealers to individuals under 21. It’s true that teenagers can and do obtain weapons with relative ease by other means; it’s also folly to open a door to further facilitate their legal purchase. Here’s hoping that the full 4th Circuit, to which the panel’s decision is likely to be appealed, will reverse a senseless ruling. Read more: Dorothy R.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old The Democrats on stage in Tuesday night's primary debate have traded barbs over guns, banking regulation and college tuition. You might forget that the candidates on stage agree about the major issues, including the economic ones. They believe that in order for most Americans to enjoy improving standards of living, the government has to intervene in the economy, redistributing wealth and reining in what they see as the excesses of the free market. Since the Second World War, the economy has done better when Democrats are in the White House, a point that Hillary Rodham Clinton made in response to a question from CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that's why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017,\" the former secretary of state said. The average rate of economic growth under Democratic presidents since the Truman administration has been 4.4 percent, compared to 2.5 percent under Republicans. The economy has performed better on other measures under Democratic presidents, too. Industrial production, unemployment and returns on the stock market have all been worse when a Republican occupies the Oval Office. It is unclear, though, whether Democrats' approach to the economy is responsible for this impressive record, or whether they just got lucky. All kinds of factors affect the economy that are beyond the president's control -- wars, oil shortages and the decisions of the Federal Reserve.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Since the election of President Trump, Republican lawmakers in at least 18 states have introduced or voted on legislation to curb mass protests in what civil liberties experts are calling “an attack on protest rights throughout the states.” From Virginia to Washington state, legislators have introduced bills that would increase punishments for blocking highways, ban the use of masks during protests, indemnify drivers who strike protesters with their cars and, in at least once case, seize the assets of people involved in protests that later turn violent. The proposals come after a string of mass protest movements in the past few years, covering everything from police shootings of unarmed black men to the Dakota Access Pipeline to the inauguration of Trump. Some are introducing bills because they say they're necessary to counter the actions of “paid” or “professional” protesters who set out to intimidate or disrupt, a common accusation that experts agree is largely overstated. “You now have a situation where you have full-time, quasi-professional agent-provocateurs that attempt to create public disorder,” said Republican state senator John Kavanagh of Arizona in support of a measure there that would bring racketeering charges against some protesters. Others, like the sponsors of a bill in Minnesota, say the measures are necessary to protect public safety on highways. Still other bills, in states like Oklahoma and South Dakota, are intended to discourage protesting related to oil pipelines. Democrats in many of these states are fighting the legislation. They cite existing laws that already make it a crime to block traffic, the possibility of a chilling effect on protests across the political spectrum, and concerns for protesters’ safety in the face of aggressive motorists. None of the proposed legislation has yet been passed into law, and several bills have already been shelved in committee. Critics doubt whether many of the laws would pass Constitutional muster. “The Supreme Court has gone out of its way on multiple occasions to point out that streets, sidewalks and public parks are places where [First Amendment] protections are at their most robust,” said Lee Rowland, a senior attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. This is by no means the first time in American history that widespread protests have inspired a legislative backlash, says Douglas McAdam, a Stanford sociology professor who studies protest movements. “For instance, southern legislatures — especially in the Deep South — responded to the Montgomery Bus Boycott (and the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education) with dozens and dozens of new bills outlawing civil rights groups, limiting the rights of assembly, etc. all in an effort to make civil rights organizing more difficult,” he said via email. “Similarly,” he added, “laws designed to limit or outlaw labor organizing or limit labor rights were common in the late 19th/early 20th century.” The ACLU’s Rowland says the new bills are not about “creating new rules that are necessary because of some gap in the law.” She points out, for instance, that “every single city and county in the United States” already has laws on the books against obstructing traffic on busy roads. Rather, Rowland says the laws’ intent is “increasing the penalties for protest-related activity to the point that it results in self-censorship among protesters who have every intention to obey the law.” Even the accusations of “paid” or “professional” agitators, which Trump has promoted, have been leveled at protesters before. “This is standard operating procedure for movement opponents,” Stanford’s McAdam said. “Civil rights workers were said to be ‘outside agitators, and the tea party was dismissed as an ‘AstroTurf’ phenomenon — funded from on high by the Koch brothers and others — rather than a legitimate ‘grass roots’ movement. In all these cases, including the present, the charges are generally bogus, with the vast majority of protesters principled individuals motivated by the force of deeply held values and strong emotion.” But now, social media has made it possible to organize larger protests more rapidly than ever before. “The older laws are becoming less effectual in dealing with these kind of groups,” said Michael Heaney of the University of Michigan, a political sociologist who studies protest movements. On top of that, “the courts have said, ‘Look, the people have a right to protest in this way.’ ” So on some level the new legislation represents an attempt by lawmakers to catch up with new realities of 21st-century protesting. Here’s a list of laws that have been introduced or voted on since the election. Arizona Arizona’s bill, introduced this week, would open up protests to anti-racketeering legislation, targeting protesters with the same laws used to combat organized crime syndicates. It would also allow police to seize the assets of anyone involved in a protest that at some point becomes violent. It recently passed the state Senate on a party-line vote and is now before the House. Colorado A bill under consideration in Colorado would strengthen penalties for “tampering” with oil and gas equipment. It’s intended to prevent activists from shutting off pipelines, a tactic that’s been used in other states. Florida A bill introduced by Republican George Gainer in the Florida Senate this month would provide criminal penalties for protesters obstructing traffic and exempt drivers from liability if they struck a protester under certain conditions. It was filed this week, and if enacted would take force on July 1. Georgia A \"Back the Badge\" bill recently passed by the Georgia Senate increases penalties for blocking \"any highway, street, sidewalk or other public passage.\" The bill is sponsored by six Republican senators. Iowa A bill supported by nine Republican sponsors would make protesters who intentionally block highways subject to felony charges and up to five years in prison. The bill’s lead sponsor told the Des Moines Register it was introduced in response to a November incident in which a protest Trump shut down part of Interstate 80 in Iowa. Indiana An Indiana Senate committee recently toned down a bill that would have allowed police to shut down highway protests using “any means necessary.” The current version allows police to issue fines for such behavior. Michigan A Michigan bill voted on late last year would have increased fines for certain “mass picketing” behavior, and made it easier for courts to shut down such demonstrations. Minnesota Bills under consideration in Minnesota would increase fines for protesters blocking highways and airports. A separate measure before the legislature would make it possible for jurisdictions to charge protesters for the costs of policing the protests. Missouri A Republican lawmaker has introduced legislation that would make it illegal for protesters to wear masks, robes or other disguises during protests deemed to be illegal. Mississippi A bill before the Mississippi legislature would make obstruction of traffic a felony punishable by a $10,000 fine and a five-year prison sentence. North Carolina A North Carolina Republican has pledged to introduce legislation making it a crime to “threaten, intimidate or retaliate against” current or former state officials, in response to an incident involving the heckling of Gov. Pat McCrory. The Senator proposing the legislation, Dan Bishop, confirmed via email that he still intends to introduce the legislation, perhaps as early as next week, after consulting with potential co-sponsors. North Dakota A number of North Dakota bills have been introduced in response to the long-standing protests there against the Dakota Access Pipeline. The measure that drew the most attention was a bill that would have removed penalties for motorists who strike protesters with their car in some circumstances. That bill failed to make it out of the House, but a number of other measures increasing penalties for certain types of protest action are advancing through the legislature. Oklahoma Inspired by pipeline protests in North Dakota, the Oklahoma legislature is considering a bill that would increase penalties for trespassing on certain pieces of “critical infrastructure” like pipelines and railways. Oregon A novel piece of legislation in Oregon would require public community colleges and universities to expel any student convicted of participating in a violent riot. South Dakota A Senate panel in South Dakota recently approved a bill that would increase penalties for certain acts of trespassing and blocking highways. It’s a response to pipeline protests in North Dakota, and to the potential for similar protests in South Dakota if the Keystone XL pipeline gets built. Tennessee A Tennessee Republican wants drivers to be protected from liability if they inadvertently strike a protester who is blocking a roadway. Virginia A Virginia bill that would have increased penalties for people who refused to leave the scene of a riot or unlawful protest died in the state Senate last month. The bill had been requested by law enforcement. Washington state Washington lawmakers are considering a bill to increase penalties for people blocking highways and railways, acts that the bill's sponsor has characterized as “economic terrorism.” This story has been updated to include information on legislation pending in Georgia.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old “We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.” –President Obama, remarks at memorial service in Dallas, July 12, 2016 We received numerous reader requests for a fact-check into this claim, almost immediately after Obama said it at the memorial service for Dallas police officers killed by sniper fire on July 7. It reminded us of a similar claim by Obama in March 2015, when he said, “There are neighborhoods where it’s easier for you to buy a handgun and clips than it is for you to buy a fresh vegetable.” In fact, he said a version of the comparison of guns and books at the time, as well. We awarded Three Pinocchios to a series of his odd exaggerations about guns, including the comparisons to buying vegetables. (After the fact-check published, some readers pointed out that he may be referring to “food deserts,” or areas of the country where it is difficult to buy fresh vegetables.) This time, Obama said a Glock, a type of handgun, is easier for teens to obtain than books or computers. Readers wanted to know: Really? Federal law prohibits licensed firearms dealers from selling a handgun, such as a Glock, to people under 21 years old. It prohibits unlicensed people, like family, from selling or transferring handguns to anyone under 18. In most states, you need to be at least 18 to purchase and own a handgun. Public libraries, on the other hand, generally don’t have an age limit or a background check for children to get a library card and access books and computers for free. John Lott, a gun-rights analyst who runs Crime Prevention Research Center, sent us this calculation as an example of access to free public resources for books and computers: There are 80 public libraries and 95 public high schools in Chicago, within a city of about 230 square miles. That comes out to a library or high school every 1.3 square miles, albeit not equally spread out throughout the city. The White House pointed us to the full context of the claim to say Obama was making “the serious point about the lack of opportunity and ready access to guns in way too many places” (the quote we are fact-checking is in bold): The White House provided supporting information that addresses lower-income areas that have limited bookstores or educational resources, compared with higher-income areas. We received several news articles portraying anecdotes from people in lower-income communities where buying guns is “as easy as buying a pack of gum,” or where it’s “easier to buy a gun or drugs here than food.” In Englewood, a Chicago neighborhood, teens have such easy access to illegal guns that they can get one for free or as little as $25 with a simple phone call. A news report by WBEZ Chicago interviewed teenage boys who have bought several guns from fellow gang members or through family or friends, starting when they were as young as 12. Further, the 80 branches of public libraries in the city this year plan to distribute more than 1 million books “to address a persistent lack of access to books in low-income neighborhoods. … There, on average, 300 children share a single book. For middle-income neighborhoods, the ratio of books per child is 13 to 1, library officials said.” According to the Chicago Tribune: “The challenge is that there are many homes in Chicago that do not have age-appropriate books for kids,” Chicago Public Library Commissioner Brian Bannon said. “Obviously, you can take a library book home, but owning your own is very different.” A 2016 New York University study identified “book deserts” in poor neighborhoods of Detroit, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, concluding that there were fewer bookstores in high-poverty areas where families can buy children’s books. Among teens whose families earn less than $50,000 a year, 78 to 83 percent owned or had access to a desktop or laptop computer, a Pew Research Center study found. Among teens from families that earn more than $50,000 a year, 88 to 92 percent owned or had access to such computers. But none of the information we received from the White House directly made a connection between the ability of teens to buy handguns and their access to books or computers. This is a catchy talking point that people obviously paid attention to, but it doesn’t make much sense. Literally speaking, not all states allow people under 21 years old to buy a handgun. And as far as we know, there’s no minimum age or a background check required to get a book or use the computer for free at a public library. The White House noted that in the context of the speech, Obama was speaking about the lack of opportunity and ready access to guns in many communities, particularly lower-income areas. It’s accurate to say there are communities that lack education, employment and health-care resources. And it’s fair to say that in some communities, there is ready access to illegally obtained guns for teens who can get them easily from a fellow gang member, friend or a family member — perhaps without even having to leave their home or their street. But the president can make that point without resorting to such an exaggerated claim based in no real statistics, and which does nothing but distract the public. The president earns Three Pinocchios.

        "articles": "Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. defended his colleagues as “jurists of exceptional integrity and experience” and said Saturday that it was a misconception that Supreme Court justices do not follow the same set of ethical principles as other judges. In his year-end report on the state of the federal judiciary, Roberts for the first time addressed a growing controversy about when justices should recuse themselves from cases and whether a code of conduct that covers lower-court judges should apply to the justices as well. Roberts, in polite but firm language, made it clear that such decisions must rest with the judiciary and did not suggest any changes. The recusal issue has been most prominent as the court prepares to address the constitutionality of the health-care overhaul law. Groups on the right have demanded that Justice Elena Kagan withdraw from the court’s consideration of the case because of her work for President Obama as solicitor general. Liberal groups have called on Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself because of the conservative political activities of his wife, Virginia Thomas. Roberts said he could not comment on “ongoing debates about particular issues,” but noted that one of the original canons of judicial ethics adopted in 1924 said judges “should not be swayed by partisan demands, public clamor or considerations of personal popularity or notoriety, nor be apprehensive of unjust criticism.” “I have complete confidence in the capability of my colleagues to determine when recusal is warranted,” Roberts wrote. “They are jurists of exceptional integrity and experience whose character and fitness have been examined through a rigorous appointment and confirmation process.” He added: “We are all deeply committed to the common interest in preserving the court’s vital role as an impartial tribunal governed by the rule of law.” Federal law requires judges and justices, including those on the Supreme Court, to disqualify themselves when their “impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” as well as for specific reasons such as a financial interest or the involvement of a family member in the litigation. In addition, it calls for recusal when the judge has served in the government and “participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy.” Roberts said the public should keep in mind a key difference between lower-court judges and Supreme Court justices: While lower-court judges can be replaced when they recuse themselves from cases, that is not the case at the “court of last resort.” “A justice accordingly cannot withdraw from a case as a matter of convenience or simply to avoid controversy,” Roberts wrote. “Rather, each justice has an obligation to the court to be sure of the need to recuse before deciding to withdraw from a case.” Allowing the court itself to decide whether justices should recuse, Roberts said, “would create an undesirable situation in which the court could affect the outcome of a case by selecting who among its members may participate.” Roberts also addressed the view of some law professors and members of Congress that the Judicial Conference’s Code of Conduct for lower-court judges should also apply to Supreme Court justices. Roberts said charges that “the Supreme Court is exempt from the ethical principles that lower courts observe” is based on “misconceptions about both the Supreme Court and the code.” Justices consult the code as a “starting point,” but it cannot answer all questions, he said. Justices may also “turn to judicial opinions, treatises, scholarly articles and disciplinary decisions” as well as seeking advice from experts and from their colleagues. Some Democratic House members have proposed legislation that would require the justices to follow the code. While Roberts did not address whether such a requirement would violate the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches, he noted twice that the judiciary complied with some legislative dictates — such as financial disclosure — even though the court had never agreed Congress had such powers. Steven Lubet, a judicial ethics expert at Northwestern University School of Law, thought Roberts was sending a clear message. “I think he’s laying down the law,\" Lubet said. Lubet and another scholar who studies the court, Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution, said they did not expect Roberts’s explanations to satisfy those who have recently criticized the court. But both praised the effort. “There’s value in him laying out what the justices do,” Wheeler said. Added Lubet: “It’s very good that he’s chosen to address the issue. There’s not been the opportunity for much exchange between the public and the court.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.",

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old A whole lot has been written lately about the alt-right, that insurgent, Internet-born identity movement that seems dead-set on swallowing the Republican party whole. The mainstream press has tried to define it. The alt-right press has tried to defend it. But over the past five days or so, we’ve also heard from a different demographic all together: The ordinary Internet foot soldiers of the alt-right are attempting to explain themselves to normies on Twitter. (Normie, for you normies in the audience, is derogatory image-board slang for safe, mainstream people — presumably, the exact sorts who haven’t embraced the movement.) 24 hours in the life of the #AltRightMeans hashtag (Indiana University) Since August 24, more than 50,000 tweets have been sent on the hashtag #AltRightMeans, according to the Observatory on Social Media at Indiana University. In terms of pure post rate, the hashtag peaked ahead of Hillary Clinton’s alt-right speech Thursday, as members of the movement readied for a new wave of outside scrutiny. But the hashtag remained hyperactive over the weekend, serving as a sort of messy, public manifesto for a group that has thus far defined itself largely in opposition to and isolation from the American mainstream. The alt-right’s take on Clinton’s speech There isn’t a cohesive or overarching philosophy here — we’re talking tens of thousands of tweets. But the most popular tweets, the ones that have been shared hundreds or thousands of times, tend to repeat three related themes. There’s an overwhelming frustration with concepts like feminism, multiculturalism, political correctness and (especially) white guilt/privilege, which members of the alt-right describe as having jeopardized their own identity or social standing. There is, very similarly, an enormous annoyance that anyone would conclude such a belief is racist, misogynistic, or otherwise problematic; such criticisms are generally framed as hysterical responses to the alt-right’s “logic.”  Finally, there are also a lot of fairly conventional attacks on Hillary Clinton, albeit attacks with a conspiratorial tinge — that she has accepted money from foreign interests, is secretly ill, or is “crooked,” for instance. What does this tell us about the alt-right that an avalanche of analyses and explainers haven’t? I mean, these themes are pretty predictable — the alt-right’s aversion to things like multiculturalism is pretty well documented. But the accounts sending these tweets, or at least the most popular and conventional ones, are sometimes surprising. As common as it’s become to dismiss alt-righters as teenage 4chan trolls with anime avatars, a lot of them look like … well, fully grown normies. An analysis of the network around the #AltRightMeans hashtag, which maps the users who were most influential on the hashtag, turns up handles like @Cernovich, @PrisonPlanet, @JaredWyand and @magnifier661 — all adult men with nary a Pepe avatar between them. And according to Demographics Pro — a firm that uses predictive analytics to infer the demographics of Twitter users — the vast majority of tweets on #AltRightMeans have come from married white men between 40 and 60 years old. That’s not a definitive analysis, mind you — this is an inference, after all, and the hashtag has been picked up well outside the alt-right community — but it complicates the easy dismissal of alt-righters as disenfranchised, neckbeard teens. For better or worse, the alt-right’s ideas about race, gender and diversity would appear to resonate with a slightly more varied cross-section of the electorate than many imagine. All of which might help clarify what #AltRightMeans … but only complicates the movement’s larger cultural implications. Liked that? Try these!

        "articles": "Debra Ell, a Republican organizer in Michigan and fervent supporter of former president Donald Trump, said she has good reason to believe the 2020 presidential election was stolen. “I think I speak for many people in that Trump has never actually been wrong, and so we’ve learned to trust when he says something, that he’s not just going to spew something out there that’s wrong and not verified,” she said, referring to Trump’s baseless claims that widespread electoral fraud caused his loss to President Biden in November. In fact, there is no evidence to support Trump’s false assertions, which culminated in a deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. But Ell, a Republican precinct delegate in her state, said the 2020 election is one of the reasons she’s working to censure and remove Jason Cabel Roe from his role as the Michigan Republican Party’s executive director — specifically that Roe accepted the 2020 results, telling Politico that “the election wasn’t stolen” and that “there is no one to blame but Trump.” “He said the election was not rigged, as Donald Trump had said, so we didn’t agree with that, and then he didn’t blame the Democrats for any election fraud,” said Ell, explaining her frustration with Roe. “He said there was no fraud — again, that’s something that doesn’t line up with what we think really happened — and then he said it’s all Donald Trump’s fault.” Nearly six months after Trump lost to Biden, rejection of the 2020 election results — dubbed the “Big Lie” by many Democrats — has increasingly become an unofficial litmus test for acceptance in the Republican Party. In January, 147 GOP lawmakers — eight senators and 139 House members — voted in support of objections to the election results, and since then, Republicans from Congress to statehouses to local party organizations have fervently embraced the falsehood. In Washington, normally chatty senators scramble to skirt the question, and internal feuding over who is to blame for the Jan. 6 insurrection has riven the House Republican leadership, with tensions between House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican, spilling into public view. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is facing a Trump-aligned primary challenger in her 2022 race, inspired by her call for Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 attack and her later vote to convict him over his role in inciting the insurrection. Local officials, too, are facing censure and threats — in states from Iowa to Michigan to Missouri — for publicly accepting the election results. And in Arizona’s largest county, a hand recount of 2.1 million votes cast in November is underway by Republicans who dispute the results, in yet another effort to overturn the results of the November contest. The issue also could reverberate through the 2022 midterms and the 2024 election, with Trump already slamming Republicans who did not resist the election results. For Republicans, fealty to the falsehood could pull the party further to the right during the primaries, providing challenges during the general election when wooing more-moderate voters is crucial. And for Democrats, the continued existence of the claim threatens to undermine Biden’s agenda. “It is not just about the Donald Trump persona,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who served as White House communications director under President Barack Obama. “Trump is also a proxy in a culture war that’s about whose side are you on, and the people that buy into QAnon and other conspiracy theories are always looking for ways to discern whose side you’re really on.” Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said that although such fealty to Trump may play well in a Republican primary, the calculation is far more complicated in local elections, general elections and critical swing states. “In the battleground states — and Georgia is a prime example of where this played out — you had local officials who were really caught between the narrative of the ‘Big Lie’ and defending their own elections and the job they’d done,” Lake said. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans, resisted direct pressure from Trump to overturn their state’s election results in favor of a Trump victory. The backlash was swift: Trump called for Kemp to resign and endorsed Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), a challenger to Raffensperger, for Georgia secretary of state. “Jody will stop the Fraud and get honesty into our Elections!” Trump said in a statement shortly after Hice announced his challenge. How the corporate backlash to Georgia’s new voting law is shaping other fights over access to the polls After the 2020 election, in which Georgia went for Biden — and later elected two Democratic senators in a runoff in January — Kemp signed a sweeping law that critics say restricts voting access in the state. The new law provoked a public outcry from voting rights activists and major corporations — Major League Baseball moved its 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta in response — but also proved an insufficient step for many Republicans who still say the election was stolen. “There’s no Republican that I know of, that I’ve spoken with, who has come to me and said, ‘Biden won fair and square,’ ” said Salleigh Grubbs, the newly elected chair of the Cobb County Republican Party in Georgia. “I absolutely do believe that there were irregularities in the election. I absolutely believe that our voices were shut out.” In Washington, McCarthy has backpedaled from his original reaction to the Jan. 6 attacks, when he said that Trump “bears responsibility,” defending Trump’s response in a recent “Fox News Sunday” interview. At the House Republicans annual policy retreat last week, he also pointedly declined to say whether Cheney — who has publicly criticized Trump’s refusal to accept the election results — was a “good fit” for the party’s leadership team. “That’s a question for the conference,” McCarthy said, while also saying that anyone criticizing Trump over the Capitol riot, as Cheney had done, was “not being productive.” Cheney finds herself in an increasingly tenuous position inside her own party, which her father once helped lead as vice president. There have been new calls for her to step down from her leadership role, and several House Republican aides said many are growing increasingly frustrated with her being so outspoken against Trump. One leadership aide added that they “wouldn’t be surprised” if a move against Cheney materializes at some point. “Trump is still a very active part of our party,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said in an Axios interview Friday about the tension between Cheney and McCarthy. “This idea that you just disregard President Trump is not where we are.” In North Carolina, former Republican governor Pat McCrory was initially highly critical of Trump, saying on his radio show that it was the former president’s own fault that he lost the election and that his false election claims were damaging to democracy. But now, running in North Carolina for the U.S. Senate and facing a tough primary, McCrory has sought to distance himself from those comments and casts himself as a “huge defender” of “Trump policies.” Several local Republicans have either stepped down or been forced out of their party positions for not supporting Trump’s baseless election claims or for criticizing the former president’s role in inciting the deadly Capitol riot. In Iowa — after telling a local newspaper that Trump should be impeached for his “atrocious conduct” in egging on the Jan. 6 attacks — Dave Millage was called a “traitor” and forced to step down as chair of the Scott County Republican Party. In Missouri, the state Republican Party’s executive director, Jean Evans, resigned from her term several weeks early amid angry and threatening calls from Trump supporters, who urged her to do more to help Trump hold on to the White House after his loss in November. And in Michigan, Ell is circulating a resolution to fellow precinct delegates to censure and remove Roe from his role as the party’s executive director. “WE, REPUBLICAN PARTY PRECINCT DELEGATES OF MICHIGAN believe that our voices and votes were removed in an illegal election on November 3, 2020,” reads the resolution. Those pushing for Roe’s removal are in the grass-roots wing of the party, not on the state committee, and Roe declined to comment on the specifics of the ongoing turmoil. But he said he believes an overhaul of voting laws is needed — if only to reassure the large percentage of voters who, spurred by Trump’s false claims, do not trust the electoral process. As Trump seizes on Arizona ballot audit, election officials fear partisan vote counts could be the norm in future elections “When half of the voters of this country don’t have faith in our electoral system, doing nothing is not an option,” Roe said. “Overwhelming majorities of Michiganders and Americans support voter ID. If all we did was make that change in our law, it would release a lot of steam from this boiling cauldron and help us get back to a more normalized political system.” Trump, meanwhile, has continued making false assertions about the election, including at a Republican gathering in Florida last month. A CNN poll released Friday found that 30 percent of Americans say Biden did not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency, including 70 percent of Republicans. Fewer than a quarter of Republicans — 23 percent — believe Biden legitimately won enough votes for the presidency. However, the percentage of Republicans who falsely say there is solid evidence that Biden did not win has dropped by eight percentage points, from 58 percent in January to 50 percent now. Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University, said the pressure inside parts of the Republican Party to support Trump’s false election narrative has “a long tail.” “It feels like this has been happening in the Republican Party for a really long time,” Phillips said. “If you allow an entire contingent of your caucus to be steeped in conspiratorial thinking, what . . . do you think is going to happen? They’re going to turn on you.” In Arizona, Republicans in the state Senate instructed Maricopa County to turn over all of its voting machinery and 2.1 million ballots for a new recount, which is underway. Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jack Sellers said that after the five-member board voted in November to certify election results that showed Biden winning the growing and diversifying county by more than two points, the backlash from local Republicans was so intense that police officers were posted at supervisors’ homes for their protection. Now, Sellers said, he worries about the divisiveness, not just in the country but also in his own party — especially in a place like Maricopa, where Republicans already have been losing ground. “In Maricopa County, only a third of the voters are Republican,” Sellers said. “A third are Democrats and a third are independents. If you don’t even have a third of the voting public altogether, how on earth can you expect to win over enough independents and others?” Last week, Republican senators remained reluctant to weigh in on just how much accepting Biden’s presidency as legitimate is becoming a key question for party stalwarts. National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rick Scott (Fla.), one of the eight senators who voted against certifying the election results, said the former president’s election falsehoods are not resonating with voters. “They’re worried about the border crisis and worried about their schools opening,” Scott said. “They’re worried about men playing in women’s sports, they’re worried about the job market, watching them kill the Keystone pipeline.” And the normally loquacious Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), who also voted against certifying the electoral college count, simply declined to answer, saying, “I don’t have any comment on that.” Alice Crites, Emily Guskin and Rosalind S. Helderman contributed to this report.

        "articles": "To borrow the infamous line of his ex-presidential ex-client, it looks like Rudolph W. Giuliani is “going to go through some things.” Like possibly being charged with a crime. Worse, some people who might have tried to save him from that fate might have actually guaranteed it. In law and in life, things have a way of coming full circle. The quoted words come from the former president’s supposedly “perfect” phone call with Ukraine’s president, and described what could happen to the American ambassador there, Marie L. Yovanovitch. It was Giuliani’s relentless efforts that got her recalled. Now that’s what might land poor Giuliani in the dock. Last week, the FBI showed up at his apartment at dawn, armed with a search warrant that reportedly focused on Yovanovitch’s firing. Questions the seized materials might answer: On whose behalf was Giuliani acting? Just Donald J. Trump, legal client? Or was Giuliani also representing Ukrainian officials who wanted the corruption-fighting diplomat gone? If the latter, Giuliani might have violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Giuliani denies any obligation to register — because, he says, he drafted his retainer agreements to disclaim lobbying or foreign representation. Whatever happens, the investigation marks yet another step in Giuliani’s unimaginable fall from grace. The once-respected former federal prosecutor, New York mayor (“America’s mayor”!), presidential candidate and possible Cabinet pick, stands reduced to a laughingstock: shirt-tucking star of the “Borat” sequel, headliner for a news conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping, and now defendant in a $1.3 billion defamation suit for having claimed that the long-dead Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez founded a voting software company that helped steal the presidency from Trump. Even before he peddled nutso election-fraud claims, Giuliani had firmly established himself as one of the world’s worst lawyers. He’s the bumbler who blurted out on national TV that his client, Individual-1, had reimbursed a $130,000 payment made to a porn star, a transaction that triggered a sprawling and ongoing New York grand jury investigation into Trump’s overall business affairs. The former first client wasn’t too thrilled about that. But he ought to be even more ticked about what came next: not one, but two, impeachments, both Rudy-enabled. Nobody — other than perhaps the impeachee himself — did more than Giuliani to get his client charged with high crimes and misdemeanors. According to a transcript published last week of a Giuliani phone call with one of the Ukrainian president’s top aides, it was Giuliani who first urged the Ukrainians to announce a bogus investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden so Ukraine could have “a much better relationship” with the United States. It was Giuliani who told the media that his Ukrainian adventure “isn’t foreign policy,” but was meant to “be very, very helpful to my client.” It wasn’t. It also wasn’t helpful for Giuliani to fill the former guy’s head with fertilizer for the Big Lie about the 2020 vote. But at least he’s loyal, standing alongside his client — and urging “trial by combat” — at the insurrectionist rally on Jan. 6 that led to impeachment No. 2. All this boggles the mind of anyone who has followed Giuliani’s lengthy career. It’s as though someone dropped him on his head. Still, as a former associate attorney general and former U.S. attorney, he surely understands that federal search warrants against lawyers don’t just fall off trees. The Justice Department doesn’t like them, out of respect for the attorney-client privilege. Prosecutors will use them if they have really strong evidence a lawyer is up to no good, and if very senior personnel in Washington agree. And, of course, only with the blessing of a federal court. That’s terrible news for Giuliani — just ask Michael Cohen, the last presidential lawyer raided by the FBI. It’s not good for the former guy, either. Giuliani’s travails have left him facing potentially staggering legal bills, which in apparent desperation he’s beseeching Trump to pay. And most important, Giuliani faces the prospect of jail. If Giuliani has anything to offer prosecutors to save himself, it would have to be Trump, the only bigger fish left. And it was arguably criminal for the then-president to have used his official powers to try to coerce foreign officials into aiding his reelection campaign. In fact, Giuliani’s admission that he wasn’t conducting foreign policy, but merely helping Trump personally, is exactly what would make the scheme prosecutable. The former guy just might want to rethink stiffing Giuliani on those bills. That’s not the ultimate irony of Giuliani’s predicament. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan tried to get permission last fall for a Giuliani raid but were rebuffed by senior officials serving under Trump. And last June, for reasons still opaque, then-Attorney General William P. Barr ousted the U.S. attorney there and tried to handpick a successor. If any of that was intended to protect Giuliani — or Trump himself — it might end up backfiring spectacularly. If a warrant had been executed before Jan. 20, it’s hard to imagine that Trump wouldn’t have pardoned Giuliani, out of spite, self-interest or both. Now it’s too late. As Giuliani cautioned on the newly disclosed transcript, “be careful of the people around you, because they can very easily, they can very easily get you into trouble.” That might be the only advice he gave that turned out to be right.

        "articles": "Every Republican of the type concerned with winning in November has been asking the question (at least internally): “What if the worst happens?” The worst does not mean the nomination of Ted Cruz, in spite of justified fears of political disaster. Cruz is an ideologue with a message perfectly tuned for a relatively small minority of the electorate. Uniquely in American politics, the senator from Texas has made his reputation by being roundly hated by his colleagues — apparently a prerequisite for a certain kind of anti-establishment conservative, but unpromising for an image makeover at his convention. Cruz’s nomination would represent the victory of the hard right — religious right and tea party factions — within the Republican coalition. After he loses, the ideological struggles within the GOP would go on. No, the worst outcome for the party would be the nomination of Donald Trump. It is impossible to predict where the political contest between Trump and Hillary Clinton would end up. Clinton has manifestly poor political skills, and Trump possesses a serious talent for the low blow. But Trump’s nomination would not be the temporary victory of one of the GOP’s ideological factions. It would involve the replacement of the humane ideal at the center of the party and its history. If Trump were the nominee, the GOP would cease to be. Whatever your view of Republican politicians, the aspiration, the self-conception, of the party was set by Abraham Lincoln: human dignity, honored by human freedom and undergirded by certain moral commitments, including compassion and tolerance. Lincoln described the “promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance.” It is this universality that Trump attacks. All of his angry resentment against invading Hispanics and Muslims adds up to a kind of ethno-nationalism — an assertion that the United States is being weakened and adulterated by the other. This is consistent with European, right-wing, anti-immigrant populism. It is not consistent with conservatism, which, at the very least, involves respect for institutions and commitment to reasoned, incremental change. And Trumpism is certainly not consistent with the Republicanism of Lincoln, who admitted no exceptions to the promises of the Declaration of Independence and was nominated, in part, because he could appeal to anti-slavery German immigrants. Liberals who claim that Trumpism is the natural outgrowth, or logical conclusion, of conservatism or Republicanism are simply wrong. Edmund Burke is not the grandfather of Nigel Farage. Lincoln is not even the distant relative of Trump. Trump, in some ways, is an odd carrier of ethno-nationalist beliefs. He held few of them, as far as I can tell, just four years ago. But as a demagogue, he has followed some of America’s worst instincts wherever they have led, and fed ethnic and religious prejudice in the process. All presidential nominees, to some extent, shape their parties into their own image. Trump would deface the GOP beyond recognition. Trump is disqualified for the presidency by his erratic temperament, his ignorance about public affairs and his scary sympathy for authoritarianism. But for me, and I suspect for many, the largest problem is that Trump would make the GOP the party of racial and religious exclusion. American political parties are durable constructions. But they have been broken before by powerful, roiling issues such as immigration and racial prejudice. Many Republicans could not vote for Trump but would have a horribly difficult time voting for Clinton. The humane values of Republicanism would need to find a temporary home, which would necessitate the creation of a third party. This might help elect Clinton, but it would preserve something of conservatism, held in trust, in the hope of better days. Ultimately, these political matters are quite personal. I have spent 25 years in the company of compassionate conservatives, reform conservatives, Sam’s Club conservatives or whatever they want to call themselves, trying to advance an agenda of social justice in America’s center-right party. We have shared a belief that sound public policy — promoting opportunity, along with the skills and values necessary to grasp it — can improve the lives of our fellow citizens and thus make politics an honorable adventure. The nomination of Trump would reduce Republican politics — at the presidential level — to an enterprise of squalid prejudice. And many Republicans could not follow, precisely because they are Republicans. By seizing the GOP, Trump would break it to pieces.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old When President Trump took office in 2017, the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense survived the transition intact. Its mission was the same as when I was asked to lead the office, established after the Ebola epidemic of 2014: to do everything possible within the vast powers and resources of the U.S. government to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic. One year later, I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like covid-19. The U.S. government’s slow and inadequate response to the new coronavirus underscores the need for organized, accountable leadership to prepare for and respond to pandemic threats. In a health security crisis, speed is essential. When this new coronavirus emerged, there was no clear White House-led structure to oversee our response, and we lost valuable time. Yes, we have capable and committed global and national disease-prevention and management organizations, as well as state and local health departments, all working overtime now. But even in prepared cities like Seattle, health systems are struggling to test patients and keep pace with growing caseloads. The specter of rapid community transmission and exponential growth is real and daunting. The job of a White House pandemics office would have been to get ahead: to accelerate the response, empower experts, anticipate failures, and act quickly and transparently to solve problems. It’s impossible to assess the full impact of the 2018 decision to disband the White House office responsible for this work. Biological experts do remain in the White House and in our government. But it is clear that eliminating the office has contributed to the federal government’s sluggish domestic response. What’s especially concerning about the absence of this office today is that it was originally set up because a previous epidemic made the need for it quite clear. Coronavirus will linger after the pandemic ends. But it won’t be as bad. The U.S. government worked hard to fight the 2014 Ebola epidemic. Unlike Central Africa, Ebola was not a usual occurrence in West Africa; the necessary elements of community trust and public health decision-making weren’t in place to detect and stop it. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were blind spots for disease surveillance. The cost was thousands of lives, billions of dollars and years of economic recovery for countries already torn by decades of war. So in 2016, after the formidable U.S.-led Ebola response, the Obama White House established the global health security office at the National Security Council and asked me to lead the team. We were to prepare for and, if possible, prevent the next outbreak from becoming an epidemic or pandemic. Our team reported to a senior-level response coordinator on the National Security Council staff who could rally the government at the highest levels, as well as to the national security adviser and the homeland security adviser. This high-level domestic and global reporting structure wasn’t an accident. It was a recognition that epidemics know no borders and that a serious, fast response is crucial. Our job was to be the smoke alarm — keeping watch to get ahead of emergencies, sounding a warning at the earliest sign of fire — all with the goal of avoiding a six-alarm blaze. We partnered with federal departments and agencies as they monitored evolving outbreaks, triggering alarms for decision-makers when those outbreaks began to take on unusual or worrisome characteristics. Shortly before Trump took office, we were watching many health security threats, including a rising number of cases in China of H7N9 influenza, a deadly strain with high mortality but low transmissibility between people. Earlier, we had been tracking a large outbreak of yellow fever in Angola that threatened to sap the limited global supply of that vaccine, affecting the local population, international travelers, deployed citizens and troops. We were focused on naturally occurring diseases and potential bioterrorism — any and every biological threat that could cause a major global health and security emergency. My office was also tasked with preparing — at home and around the world — for the next health emergency, no matter its origin. In 2014, even before the first cases of Ebola came to light in Guinea, the Obama administration launched the Global Health Security Agenda, which now includes more than 60 countries, to accelerate epidemic preparedness. That effort, bolstered by $1 billion from the U.S. government in an emergency spending bill to fight Ebola, led to major gains in global capability to combat the Ebola outbreak and prepare for the next pandemic, which turned out to be covid-19. We began building, measuring and tracking capacities each country had, such as the strength of their national laboratory systems and their abilities to detect and report disease, stand up emergency operation centers, build an epidemiology workforce, and maintain safe and secure practices. We spurred the use of transparent, measurable assessments of progress, and we leveraged our diplomacy with other countries to finance and fill gaps. At the same time, we strengthened international biosurveillance networks to help alert us to future potential pandemics. We can’t stop the pandemic now. But we can be ready for it. Another critical task came in early 2017, when we began transitioning pandemic preparedness to the incoming Trump administration. As a civil servant and the head of the directorate, I remained at the White House for several months after the transition. I attended senior-level meetings and directly briefed the homeland security adviser and the national security adviser. After I left the White House that March, pandemic preparedness remained on the agenda; my office remained intact under the leadership of my well-respected successor, Rear Adm. Tim Ziemer; and the national security adviser was tracking H7N9 and other emerging threats. It’s unclear whether the decision to disband the directorate, which was made in May 2018, after John Bolton became national security adviser, was a tactical move to downgrade the issue or whether it was part of the White House’s interest in simplifying and shrinking the National Security Council staff. Either way, it left an unclear structure and strategy for coordinating pandemic preparedness and response. Experts outside government and on Capitol Hill called for the office’s reinstatement at the time. Its absence now is all too evident. In his remarks Wednesday night, the president talked about travel bans and the resilience of the U.S. economy but made little specific mention of the public health crisis unfolding across America — exactly the kind of detail a dedicated NSC pandemics infrastructure would have pushed to address. A directorate within the White House would have been responsible for coordinating the efforts of multiple federal agencies to make sure the government was backstopping testing capacity, devising approaches to manufacture and avoid shortages of personal protective equipment, strengthening U.S. lab capacity to process covid-19 tests, and expanding the health-care workforce. The office would galvanize resources to coordinate a robust and seamless domestic and global response. It would identify needs among state and local officials, and advise and facilitate regular, focused communication from federal health and scientific experts to provide states and the public with fact-based tools to minimize the virus’s spread. The White House is uniquely positioned to take into account broader U.S. and global security considerations associated with health emergencies, including their impact on deployed citizens, troops and regional economies, as well as peace and stability. A White House office would have been able to elevate urgent issues fast, so they didn’t linger or devolve to inaction, as with coronavirus testing in the United States. It would be in charge of sharing information and coordinating our public health and humanitarian response with partners and allies. And it would work now to prepare the United States and the world for the next pandemic, including by developing incentives for global leaders and governments to rapidly finance and fill identified gaps. Pandemics, like weapons of mass destruction and climate change, are transnational threats with potentially existential consequences. No single department or agency can be responsible for handling them. Pandemic threats may not arise every year, but the White House should constantly prepare for them. We can’t afford for federal decision-makers to waste time relearning old lessons when they should be innovating and acting. Covid-19 wasn’t preventable, but it was predictable. Hopefully, its impact can still be limited. But it is well past time for the U.S. government to show the leadership required for an effective domestic and global response. We need to start sprinting. Come April and May, no one will wish the United States had done less. Read more from Outlook: Five myths about the coronavirus The coronavirus is here. Someone please tell us what to do.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Four years ago this week, all the Republican candidates for president were asked in a debate what would happen if they were presented a deal to tackle the federal deficit, and the deal would yield $10 in budget cuts for every $1 of tax increases. “Who on this stage would walk away from that deal?” asked Fox News’s Bret Baier. Every single one of them raised their hands, so deeply offensive did they find the notion of any tax increase at all, even one that would allow enormous progress on another goal they claimed to hold dear. While the same question wasn’t asked in the first GOP debate of this season, perhaps it will be in one of the upcoming debates. And when it does, the answer may be the same, or nearly so. Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform has announced that Chris Christie has signed “The Pledge,” ATR’s blood oath in which Republican politicians promise to never, ever, ever raise taxes for any reason (h/t Steve Benen). Norquist has become a kind of high priest of tax purity, with the power to declare which Republicans have kept the faith and which are vile apostates who must be cast out of the temple. As the group’s news release about Christie says, “In 2012, all candidates for the Republican nomination for president signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, with the lone exception of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. Huntsman finished seventh in Iowa and third in New Hampshire before dropping out of the race.” So don’t get any ideas. And in this election, they’re having almost as much success. Other candidates who have signed the Pledge either this year or in the past include Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Carly Fiorina, Rick Santorum, Ben Carson, Bobby Jindal, Scott Walker, Lindsey Graham, John Kasich, Jim Gilmore and Mike Huckabee. In other words, only three of the 17 candidates haven’t taken the pledge: George Pataki, Donald Trump and Jeb Bush. Are those stragglers going to come on board? Who knows what Trump would say if he was asked about it. Probably something entertaining yet not quite coherent, like “Pledges are for losers, and my tax policy is going to be so super-classy it’ll create a billion new jobs and make Mexico beg me to build a wall made of the finest cubic zirconium along our border.” And Bush, whom many people still think is going to wind up with the nomination, has actually ruled out taking the pledge. In fact, when testifying before Congress in 2012, he got asked the same question the candidates faced in their primary debate, and he responded, “If you could bring to me a majority of people to say that we are going to have ten dollars of spending cuts for one dollar of revenue enhancement — put me in, coach.” These days when you ask Bush about this topic, he’ll say bluntly that he has always rejected Norquist’s pledge but will quickly recite his record of cutting taxes as Florida governor. Perhaps the whole idea of absolute pledges makes him nervous, given the fact that his father said, “Read my lips: no new taxes,” then later did the right thing and accepted some tax increases as part of a budget deal, and for his trouble got forever branded as a traitor by the right. Though it goes back many years, the Pledge is in some ways the perfect embodiment of the current era in Republican politics. It takes a conservative principle — raising taxes is bad — and elevates it to the status of a holy commandment, one that can never be violated. It insists that context never matters, compromise is abhorrent by definition and the slightest deviation from orthodoxy should be punished without mercy. Deficits, wars, supervolcanoes, alien invasion — no matter what a future president might face, he cannot ever raise taxes for any reason. You have to hand it to Norquist: almost every Republican in Congress has taken the Pledge, and he’s gotten 14 out of the 17 presidential candidates to genuflect before him, which isn’t too shabby. I may not have a lot of good things to say about Jeb Bush, but let’s at least give him credit for not giving in to Norquist’s bullying. And we should hope that in one of the future debates, the GOP presidential candidates face a question like the one their predecessors did. Unlike many gimmicky-sounding debate questions, this one actually tells us something important. Because presidents keep the vast majority of the promises they make, it’s good to get them all on record in a high-profile setting. Then the voters will know what to expect in the budget battles that will inevitably be part of the next presidency.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old President Trump is planning on cutting taxes, and his advisers have been arguing that he does not need to reduce federal spending at the same time. Instead, they say, reduced taxes will stimulate the U.S. economy to such a great degree that the government will not have to borrow more money to make up the difference. Economists aren't buying it, according to a new survey conducted at the University of Chicago. Eighty-four percent of the experts polled disagreed that Trump's tax cuts would pay for themselves through increased economic growth. Just 5 percent said that they would, while the rest did not offer an opinion. (Update: After this story was published, the economists who said that Trump’s tax cuts would pay for themselves said they had misread the survey. Read more about their views here.) The figures were published Tuesday by the university's Initiative on Global Markets, which regularly polls a panel of prominent economists for their opinions on issues in the news. Republicans have long argued that the economic stimulus from reduced taxes will increase the taxes the government collects on wages and investment, canceling out any effect on the government's bottom line. At a conference for investors in Beverly Hills on Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that fostering economic growth, along with getting rid of certain tax breaks, would make up for the foregone revenue. “We expect to pay for this through economic growth, and through eliminating a lot of deductions,” Mnuchin said, adding that tax cuts could increase the rate of economic growth from around 2 percent to as much as 3 percent a year. Recent tax cuts have not had that effect, however. The economy's performance did not improve after President George W. Bush cut taxes beginning in 2001. Many experts believe that President Ronald Reagan's cuts did have benefits for the broader economy, but not enough that the cuts paid for themselves. Trump, in new tax plan, promises to do what Reagan couldn't In their comments on the questionnaire, several economists noted that when the White House laid out Trump's priorities and principles for the tax system in a one-page document last week, the outline lacked crucial details. For instance, the document offered scant information about whether larger families would get a break as they do in the current system, how imports and exports would be taxed or what multinational corporations would owe on their earnings overseas. “I'm not sure it should be called a 'plan,' \" wrote David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It's so devoid of content.” He added, though, that the information that was available suggested Trump's approach “would be a fiscal disaster.” Asked whether tax cuts since 1980 have ever paid for themselves in general, no economists argued that they had, although 17 percent said they were uncertain or had no opinion about the question. “Cutting taxes can stimulate growth, but typically not by enough to increase total revenue collected,” wrote Yale University's Larry Samuelson.

        "articles": "The election is over: Joe Biden won. Even Karl Rove now admits President Trump’s legal challenges won’t reverse the results. GOP state legislators are leaking word that they won’t facilitate the Hail Mary of appointing a rogue slate of electors in defiance of their state’s popular vote. The claims of fraud are imploding. Yet with Trump still refusing to concede, the administration’s sabotaging of the transition continues. So Democrats must crank up the pressure on the administration to drop its blockade, for the good of the transition itself and to prevent such tactics from being normalized. Here’s the latest. Emily Murphy, the head of the General Services Administration, still hasn’t signed the official letter that would allow the incoming Biden team to formally begin the transition. A few days ago, Congressional Democrats wrote their own letter to Murphy, demanding that she provide a rationale for refusing to allow the transition to proceed — and, importantly, insisting she disclose whether she’s doing so under Trump’s orders. They demanded an answer by Wednesday. A day later, Murphy has still not replied, according to Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), the chair of the House Oversight subcommittee with jurisdiction over the GSA. “Nothing yet,” Connolly told me. “Given the immediacy of this issue, I would expect and demand a prompt reply.” Connolly also said Democrats would now consider the “next steps” in ratcheting up pressure on Murphy. Such steps, obviously, would have to include hearings, subpoenaing Murphy and any documents related to her refusal to sign the letter, and perhaps more. A great deal is at stake here. By law, the GSA administrator is supposed to ascertain when there is an “apparent winner” of the race, which releases a tremendous amount of governmental resources to be put at the disposal of the incoming team. But the GSA has said that it has not yet ascertained this, leaving experts to raise the possibility that the transition could be delayed for the first time other than during the dispute over the 2000 presidential race. That could ultimately do real damage. Transitions are tremendously complex operations, and lost days could increase the risks, especially with Biden taking over amid health and economic crises that are rapidly worsening by the day. What’s more, the GSA recognition is also supposed to serve as a sign throughout the government that the transition should proceed. And there are plenty of indications that it isn’t. Biden transition officials have said the Trump administration is reneging on its promises to initiate other critical procedures ensuring a smooth transition. And sources tell Dana Milbank that the administration has yet to make good on a 9/11 Commission recommendation that the new team should be immediately apprised of classified info about national security threats. “We can’t be silent in the face of intransigence from the head of the agency that has a routine mission to facilitate the transition and the peaceful transfer of power,” Connolly told me. Even some Republicans — such as Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma and former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee — now say Biden should already be getting his daily intelligence briefing. But this should also put more pressure on House Democrats to do what they can to force the issue, as Brian Beutler points out. “Serious thought has to be given to next steps,” Connolly told me. Still, he declined to specify that a subpoena is being considered, noting that Democrats don’t want to get ahead of what the Biden transition team wants. Biden officials declined to tell me their preference on this front. What’s more, the House Democratic leadership would also theoretically have to approve a subpoena or other tactics, and it’s not clear whether they’re prepared to do so, perhaps also out of deference to the Biden team. But it’s not clear why there should be any hold up here. In addition to the daily damage a delayed transition can do, we deserve to know whether Trump is actively using this mechanism to try to burn the place down on his way out. As the Democrats demanded that Murphy disclose in their letter to her: We deserve an answer to this question. Democrats should use all the tools at their disposal to extract one. “The administrator’s silence shows contempt for both Congress and the nation, which just overwhelmingly elected President-elect Biden,” Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, told me. “It would be a damn shame if Ms. Murphy wants her legacy to be that of an accomplice to an attempted hijacking of our democracy,” Pascrell continued. Something else is at stake here, too: The question of whether refusing to concede, and weaponizing the transition as a way to both sabotage the incoming administration and inflict revenge on the American people for rejecting an outgoing president, will become normalized as tools of political warfare. Or, more finely put, as weapons of warfare against the country itself. Watch Opinions videos: Read more: Jennifer Rubin: Stop wasting time on Trump’s lawsuits. More nefarious behavior is afoot.

        "articles": "Hillary Clinton holds a 2-to-1 national lead over Bernie Sanders in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, enjoying a wide advantage on handling terrorism while trailing her rival narrowly on honesty, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Clinton receives 59 percent of the support among Democratic-leaning registered voters, while 28 percent back Sanders. Clinton’s standing changed little from the 60 percent received a month ago, while the Vermont senator’s support dipped from a high of 34 percent in November. Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley stands at 5 percent, compared with 2 percent in October. [ Read full results and how the poll was conducted ] Clinton’s current national lead is reminiscent of where she stood eight years ago, when a Post-ABC poll showed her leading then-Sen. Barack Obama by 28 points. Then, as now, polls in the two earliest states — Iowa and New Hampshire — both showed a closer race, particularly in Iowa. But parallels between 2008 and today may be limited. In 2008, after Obama won the Iowa caucuses, African Americans united behind him over Clinton, supporting him by an average of 82 percent to 15 percent across all primary contests where exit polls were conducted. So far this year, Sanders has struggled to make inroads among African American Democrats. Clinton is leading 71 percent to 19 percent over the two most recent Post-ABC surveys. Sanders’s support among white voters has helped make him competitive in those first two overwhelmingly white states, but his mixed support among African American and Hispanic voters, who make up a larger portion of the electorate in states with later contests, creates a substantial obstacle for him to overcome. [ The new number that drives home Bernie Sanders’s black voter problem ] In addition, Clinton has secured extraordinary support from Democratic lawmakers for her candidacy. An outright majority of Democratic senators and House members have endorsed Clinton’s candidacy, unprecedented in modern nomination cycles. Just two of Sanders colleagues have endorsed his candidacy. The latest shift in focus to terrorism and national security after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., plays to Clinton’s strengths, although a plurality of Democrats say the economy is the most important issue to them. More than 6 in 10 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (64 percent) say Clinton would better handle the threat of terrorism. That compares with 26 percent who give Sanders the edge. Clinton also leads Sanders by 17 percentage points on which candidate is closest to them on issues and by 13 points on understanding people’s problems, with results little changed from October. Honesty represents Sanders’s clearest opening against Clinton. The poll found that 44 percent of Democrats say he is more honest and trustworthy than Clinton while 38 percent choose Clinton over Sanders. Among Democrats who currently support Clinton, 6 in 10 say she is the more honest while about 2 in 10 choose Sanders; the rest rate them similarly or have no opinion. Demographically, Sanders’s support is concentrated among liberal and white Democrats, but The Post-ABC poll finds his advantage among both groups has fallen in the past month. In November, Sanders led Clinton by a 21-point margin among Democratic voters under age 40, but the new poll finds younger Democrats splitting between him and Clinton. Among liberal Democrats, Sanders trails Clinton by 22 points, with her expanding her 7-point edge in November. It is not clear why those numbers have shifted. National polls are not always reliable predictors of early state voting. Recent state polls highlight the differences. In Iowa, a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg Politics poll released last weekend found Clinton leading by 9 percentage points among likely voters in the state’s Feb. 1 caucuses. In New Hampshire, whose primary will be held Feb. 9, Sanders led by 10 points in a CNN/WMUR poll this month. In South Carolina, Clinton held a commanding 44-point lead among likely voters in an early December Fox News poll. In late 2007, she and Obama were competitive with each other there, but she eventually lost the state by a wide margin, in large part because of Obama’s 78 percent to 19 percent support among African American voters. In the latest survey, she leads Sanders 82 percent to 11 percent among black voters. The Post-ABC poll was conducted Dec. 10-13 among a random national sample of 1,002 adults reached on conventional and cellular telephones. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The error margin is plus or minus 5.5 points among the sample of 377 Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters.

        "articles": "A messy, public brawl over a Google critic’s ouster from a Washington think tank has exposed a fissure in Democratic Party politics. On one side there’s a young and growing faction advocating new antimonopoly laws, and on the other a rival faction struggling to defend itself. At issue is a decades-long relationship between Democrats and tech companies, with Democratic presidents signing off on deregulation and candidates embracing money and innovations from firms like Google and Facebook. Now, locked out of power and convinced that same coziness with large corporations cost them the presidency, Democrats are talking themselves into breaking with tech giants and becoming an antimonopoly party. The argument had a breakthrough last week when it was reported that Barry Lynn, a monopoly critic and longtime scholar at the Google-funded New America Foundation, was leaving and taking his 10-person initiative with him. Lynn, who has been critical of Google, had praised European regulators for hitting the company with a $2.7 billion antitrust fine. The foundation, which has received more than $21 million from Google, removed Lynn’s comments from its website. “A lot of people see this as a tipping point,” Lynn said of his departure in an interview. “This is something that’s upset people on both sides of the aisle.” Soon after, Lynn’s project, Citizens Against Monopoly, launched with a website that asked people to protest “Google’s unethical behavior” and pledged that “Google’s attempt to shut us down will fail.” New America’s president, Anne-Marie Slaughter, pushed back, warning that Lynn was starting a family feud at a moment when Democrats could not afford it. \"Barry's new organization and campaign against Google is the opening salvo of one group of Democrats versus another group of Democrats in the run-up to the 2020 election,\" Slaughter wrote on Medium. \"I personally think the country faces far greater challenges of racism, violence, a broken political system, and geographic and partisan divisions so great that we are losing any common sense of what we stand and strive for as a country.\" The Democrats’ anti-monopolists have been winning the argument inside the party. During the Obama years, they’d been routed, as Google’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, strongly supported the president, and the Federal Trade Commission abandoned an antitrust case against the company. Over the years, Schmidt gave $842,900 to Democrats, and less than half as much to Republicans. “Google was Obama’s Halliburton,” said Luther Lowe, the vice president of public policy at Yelp. A shift began when Democrats began to look for their next president. In October 2015, fending off a primary challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Hillary Clinton wrote an op-ed for the business site Quartz in which she promised to “take a page from Teddy Roosevelt” and “stop corporate concentration in any industry where it’s unfairly limiting competition.” In June 2016, Lynn organized a conference where Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) argued the next president, which most assumed would be Clinton, could reverse the Obama administration’s lax antitrust policy. Democrats needed to consider the long-term implications for consumers, for jobs and for wages, she suggested. “How do we get more competition? And how do we do it without new legislation that would require cooperation from a Congress awash in campaign contributions and influence peddling?” Warren asked. “We can start with a president and an executive branch willing to once again enforce our laws in the way Congress originally intended them to be enforced.” Antitrust issues garnered almost no attention during the 2016 presidential campaign. In April, Hart Research Associates conducted polling, circulated among Democrats and think tanks, that found an enormous opening for antimonopoly politics. The polling, which surveyed 1,120 voters overall and 341 from the decisive Rust Belt states, found just a slim majority saying Democrats favored “average Americans” over “large corporations and banks.” Those corporations and banks were toxic. The polling found “corporate monopolies” viewed negatively by 66 percent of all voters, and 70 percent of Rust Belt voters. Just 21 percent of Rust Belt voters, however, favored “antitrust laws.” Congressional Democrats who saw that polling factored it into the “Better Deal,” their economic agenda and attempt to rebrand the party. The plan, which was released July 24, spent four pages arguing for new antitrust laws, standards that would make mergers more difficult, and a “competition advocate” with the power to police issues. “It was a really good start,” Lynn said. “This is going to be a long process, and a long series of battles — not just inside the party, but intellectual battles.” But the minority party's policy sheet did not captivate readers like Lynn's spat with Google did. In two tweets, Warren called Lynn's ouster \"troubling\" and said the credibility of think tanks \"is jeopardized when decisions are based on funder preferences.\" (Warren declined to comment further.) “There was a growing awareness that corporate monopolies were a big problem,” explained Zephyr Teachout, a two-time Democratic candidate in New York for governor and the U.S. House, who will chair Open Markets when it gets off the ground. “This really hit a nerve. It could have been a one-day story and disappeared by the end of the week. The same story five years ago wouldn’t have had the same resonance. But the corporate concentration of power has gotten so much worse.” The Democrats’ long detente with monopolies was good for fundraising, especially as more money from energy and banking companies slid toward Republicans. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a backer of tougher antimonopoly policies whose district includes Google’s campus, said Democrats and tech companies needed to adjust to a new world. “If you take a thoughtful position and are able to justify it intellectually, you won’t lose support from tech leaders,” Khanna said. “My experience has been that the community is pretty open to robust debate.” Read more at PowerPost We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.",

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are chastising Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) for rebuffing their efforts to investigate price hikes by two pharmaceutical companies. \"My constituents are dying,\" Ranking Member Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) said at a news conference Wednesday morning. \"They are dying because they cannot get a cure.\" In a letter to Chaffetz, he and other members said Republicans have \"refused every request\" to hold hearings or issue subpoenas to drug companies. They ask Republicans to allow them to move forward next month: \"Even if you have no interest in investigating these abuses on behalf of your own constituents, we ask that you not block us from investigating them on behalf of ours.\" Cummings has for months been urging an investigation into Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which is now being probed by federal prosecutors, and has demanded documents from both Valeant and Turing Pharmaceuticals. After those requests were refused, he and his fellow Democrats in September pushed for hearings where the CEOs of the two firms would testify. He said Wednesday that three Republicans, including one member of the Oversight Committee, have asked him to push Democrats to do something about drug prices. \"I say talk to Chaffetz,\" he said. He added that he hoped newly-elected House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) will take up the issue. A spokeswoman for Chaffetz did not immediately return a request for comment. Drug price increases have become a major issue on the presidential campaign trail, gaining traction after Turing's price increases were put in the spotlight. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton has promised to cap drug costs. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) is opposing President Obama’s nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration because of pharmaceutical prices. Republican Donald Trump called Turing CEO Martin Shkreli a \"spoiled brat.\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called price hikes \"pure profiteering.\" A Kaiser Family Foundation poll last week found that high drug prices are far and away Americans' top health concern. Cummings has been working on this issue since 2011, when the head coach of the University of Maryland women's basketball team wrote to him about a shortage of the drug her son needed to treat his cancer. The shortage was related to profit concerns. Democrats acknowledged Wednesday that without Republican support, they cannot move legislation in Congress. But, they said, they could prod the other party, as well as the White House and pharmaceutical companies, themselves. \"Shaming is important as well,\" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said. The Senate, meanwhile, has launched an investigation into Turing, Valeant and a third company. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old We’re in a profoundly unusual situation at the moment. The presidential election is less than eight months away, a recession is looming, and the opposition party is essentially saying to the president, “Please let us save the economy, which is your only hope of getting reelected.” Yet we don’t know whether he and his party will accept the offer. The problem is that we have three centers of power — Democrats in Congress, Republicans in Congress and White House officials — and each may have different ideas about exactly what we should do to head off economic disaster. I spoke to a number of economists and federal policy experts, who told me there are some extremely good and extremely bad ideas on the table. The choices we make among them will determine whether this is an economic challenge that is difficult but manageable, or whether we fall off a cliff. As the federal government tries to simultaneously address the coronavirus and mitigate the economic damage it’s touching off, there are three distinct but related sets of actions we can take. We're looking for stories of how the coronavirus has affected people of all walks of life. Write to us. The first is spending aimed directly at stopping the spread of the virus: buying masks, producing a vaccine, paying for testing and so on. Everyone, Republicans and Democrats, agrees that’s necessary. The second set of actions is focused on the people most directly affected by the economic fallout. Some of that can be done by extending existing programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps and paying for sick leave, but it can also include simply giving people money. President Trump has suggested a cut in the payroll tax, but many economists dismiss the idea. “I can think of nothing worse,” Claudia Sahm, director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, told me. The problem is that, while it costs a huge amount, much of it goes to people who don’t need it, and for the people who do, it’s too slow and too small. She suggests dropping all federal withholding (including income taxes) down to zero, capped at $500 a month, and is also open to simply sending every family a check. That would have the benefit of reaching people who have been laid off, or gig workers whose work has dried up. As Jacob Leibenluft of the Center for American Progress told me, this isn’t just an economic measure, it’s also a public health measure. Giving money to people directly enables them to make economic choices that limit the spread of the virus. If you’re an Uber driver worried about making ends meet, an infusion of cash can make it possible to stay at home for a week or two instead of going out and getting infected. All the experts I spoke to stressed the importance of moving quickly. “The response should be fast and aggressive,” says Chye-Ching Huang, senior director of economic policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “There’s a high downside risk to doing too little, too late.\" Moving quickly is needed to address the immediate suffering that comes from a downturn, but also because “you don’t necessarily get back the productive capacity” we could lose in a deep recession, Huang added. So while the president might be shouting that the Federal Reserve should lower interest rates, they’re already so low that bringing them down further won’t do all that much, and it would be of limited benefit in the short run. “Just send the money out,” says Sahm. “You have to use pipes that exist. You can’t create structures that aren’t there.” One measure that many mentioned was increasing the federal share of Medicaid dollars. State budgets will be stressed as people suffering from the virus strain the medical system, and because almost every state has a requirement to balance their budgets, that could mean they’d have to cut spending and lay off workers at the worst possible moment. “We need to be putting hundreds of billions of dollars into states to have a public health response and help states shore up their safety nets,” Sahm says. The third set of actions we can take once the first two are addressed would be focused on the medium- to long-term, meaning stimulus that isn’t directly related to the impact of coronavirus but that gives the economy the strength to bounce back. As Leibenluft points out, we already had an underinvestment problem before, in infrastructure, education and clean energy. Trump might be open to spending on those things, but he’ll get pushback from Republicans. For example, the conservative Heritage Foundation argues that any measures the government takes should be focused solely on the direct effects of the epidemic itself, not on boosting the economy broadly. So the threat we face right now is that we won’t spend enough money, and we’ll spend it in ways that aren’t effective. “We are repeating the mistake of 2008,” Sahm says, in large part because the policymakers are talking about spending too little. “To fight a recession, you have to throw a lot of money at it.” If that’s going to happen, it will be because Trump realizes it’s in his interests — and can wrap his head around the fact that Democrats are the ones who actually want to help him do it.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old This post comes via Know More, Wonkblog's social media site. On a national scale, a buyer who puts 20 percent down would need to earn a salary of $48,604 to afford the median-priced home in America. But that total varies a lot from city to city. Pittsburgh, Cleveland, St. Louis and Cincinnati rank as the most affordable metros in which to buy a new home – HSH.com estimates that you can buy the median home while making less than $34,000 – while New York, Los Angeles and San Diego are at the high end, requiring salaries of nearly $90,000 or more. But the most expensive city by far is San Francisco, where the site estimates you would need to make $142,448 to buy the median home in the area. The site's calculations assume that a buyer spends 28 percent of gross monthly income on housing, including principal, interest, taxes and insurance, (in line with industry guidelines for standard \"front-end\" debt ratios) and makes a 20 percent down payment on a house. To calculate the cost of buying the median-priced house in a given urban area, HSH.com combines its own average interest rate for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages in the fourth quarter; the National Association of Realtors’ data on median-home prices in the fourth quarter; average metropolitan property tax data from the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank; and statewide average homeowner insurance premium costs from the Insurance Information Institute, an industry organization. The data is, of course, an estimate — for one, property taxes and insurance costs will vary depending on the property — but it gives you a good idea of how housing costs varied around the country in the fourth quarter. You can read more about the methodology and see the site's data here.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old One of the more effective speeches during the Democratic convention came from former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. In many ways, Bloomberg is what Donald Trump wants to be: a very rich guy who runs a media company and who converted that wealth into political power. Of all of the rich New Yorkers involved in the 2016 campaign, Bloomberg is the richest, worth some $40 billion, four times what Trump says he's worth and 13 times what Bloomberg (the media company) estimates Trump is actually worth. (Hillary Clinton, by contrast, is a lowly millionaire.) Bloomberg is an ideological centrist in a way that now seems almost quaint, and his endorsement of Clinton on Wednesday night was more an anti-endorsement of Trump. He hammered Trump, questioning his actual wealth, calling him a con man and a hypocrite, and suggesting that Clinton deserved votes because she is \"sane\" and \"mature.\" And on Thursday, as Clinton was preparing to accept her party's nomination, Trump got mad about it. At an event in Iowa, he started talking about how he wanted to \"hit\" the Democratic speakers at the convention who were disparaging him. The choice of words was awkward, but it seems clear he meant it in the way he's used it throughout his campaign: To go after them with verbal or tweeted insults. \"I was going to hit one guy in particular, a very little guy,\" Trump said, making a clear reference to Bloomberg's stature. \"I was going to hit this guy so hard his head would spin and he wouldn't know what the hell happened. He came out of nowhere!\" Trump continued to assail Bloomberg on Twitter on Friday morning, starting off with another joke about his height. If Bloomberg were to run again, Trump wrote, he \"wouldn't get 10% of the vote.\" Interestingly, a poll conducted in New York state in March showed Bloomberg beating Trump in a three-way contest with Bloomberg running as an independent. In New York City, Bloomberg got nearly twice as much support. As BuzzFeed's Andrew Kaczynski pointed out on Twitter, Trump's attitude on Bloomberg's final term has changed pretty substantially of late. Here's Trump tweeting about Bloomberg during the latter's final term. And shortly before he left office. And, of course, praising Bloomberg for giving him a project. The project in this case was a golf course in the Bronx, called Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point. Built on an old landfill, the course briefly had a problem with excessive methane output. All of Trump's tweets above came before Bloomberg denounced him on television. As we've seen so many times in the past, nothing changes Trump's opinion on someone faster than their expressing a negative opinion of him. Bloomberg has not yet been baited into tweeting a response, which no doubt comforted Clinton. Update: ...but a former Bloomberg spokesman did.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist running for president, had some advice Thursday for people preparing to watch the first Republican debate: Imagine you're “extremely greedy and selfish,” and the candidates will be speaking to you. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who has emerged as the leading alternative to Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination, offered his preview of the GOP’s 10-candidate encounter in Cleveland during an interview on “The Agenda with Ari Rabin-Havt” on SiriusXM’s Progress Channel 127. [Here’s why Bernie Sanders plans to speak at Liberty University next month] “Listen closely, and this is what they will tell you,” Sanders advised. “They want to give more tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires at a time when the rich are getting much richer. … Essentially, when you watch that debate, just imagine if you are one of the wealthiest people in this country and extremely greedy and selfish, and you're going to have 10 candidates more or less talking about your needs and not the needs of the working people.” Sanders has seen his crowds swell and his poll numbers rise this summer as he rails against the political influence of the “billionaire class.” [Democratic presidential hopefuls to debate for first time Oct. 13] Sanders, Clinton and the other Democratic hopefuls will get their first turn at a debate in October, under a schedule of sanctioned debates released Thursday by the Democratic National Committee.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old THE PLUM LINE: President Trump is now denying that he ever described developing nations as “shithole countries.” But he is acknowledging that he did use “tough” language in the context of the debate over whether to take in people from said shitholes, and in so doing, he is only confirming that the mask has now been torn off for good. Multiple TV journalists have flatly declared that Trump has revealed himself as a racist. It’s good that it’s now safe to say this on prime-time television, but we already knew that. What this episode also does is shatter the endless euphemisms and dissembling that Trump and his allies have employed to obscure a related truth: that the nationalism at the core of Trumpism is heavily driven by a reactionary backlash to the current ethnic and racial mix of the U.S. population — it is white nationalism, despite all the what-me-racist protestation to the contrary. Trump’s comments also reveal that this basic truth is shaping the White House’s policy stances in the current immigration debate, something that is also being obscured with all sorts of rhetorical trickery. Trump’s comments have upended the negotiations underway over a deal to protect the “dreamers.” But it can no longer be denied that Trump opposes the deal at least in part because it does not do enough to resist or roll back ongoing racial and demographic trends. Consider the particulars of the current immigration talks and Trump’s response to them. In the White House, a bipartisan group of senators yesterday presented an agreement that would grant protected status to the dreamers who were brought here illegally as children, pump more money into border security, tweak family-based immigration and end the “Diversity Visa Lottery Program,” which distributes visas to countries with historically low immigration rates, many in Africa and Central Asia, channeling those visas to some U.S. residents with temporary protected status (TPS) from countries like El Salvador, Nicaragua and Haiti, a program Trump is rolling back. There is nothing ‘professional’ about this president Trump reportedly reacted to a discussion of that last component of the deal by saying: “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” before suggesting the United States should instead allow in more people from countries like Norway. Trump now claims he only used “tough” language about this deal, but his reported comments illuminate his actual policy stance: Trump is, in fact, rejecting the deal because it lets in too many people from what he thinks are “shithole countries,” or lets too many of them remain. Trump objects to the agreement because he claims it makes so-called chain migration (family-based immigration) and the lottery system “worse,” meaning we must take in “large numbers of people” from “high crime … countries which are doing badly.” That openly concedes that Trump wants fewer people from those countries here. The meaning of this is plain. Trump has claimed he objects to the lottery program because it admits terrorists, but he still objects to the deal reached on it because it still allows people (those with TPS) from the wrong countries, the “shithole” countries, to remain. He wants more funding for the wall, which is symbolic, yes, but that’s exactly the point: As Frank Sharry of America’s Voice puts it to me, the wall is a “middle finger to Latin America,” a statement that “we don’t want your kind.” It’s a middle finger to shithole countries, but more to the point, it’s a statement that we don’t want the people from them. Trump also opposes the current deal because it would restrict family-based immigration (in which current immigrant citizens or permanent residents sponsor relatives for entry) only for the parents of the dreamers and some others, whereas Trump wants much greater reductions in family-based immigration. But as Dara Lind points out, while this debate is complicated, this functionally means large reductions in the numbers of people from countries who already have large immigrant populations here — which means resisting trends shaping our current ethnic and national mix. No, President Trump, we Haitians don’t all have AIDS In light of Trump’s apparent claim that he wants to prioritize people from countries such as Norway, the uglier white nationalist cast of all of this is inescapable. Trump’s fellow travelers have gone to great lengths to obscure this basic reality. In a now-infamous exchange, CNN’s Jim Acosta asked White House immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller whether Trump’s policies are designed “to engineer the racial and ethnic flow of people into this country.” Miller reacted with outrage and repeatedly cast the goal as reducing the mere numbers of immigrants — ostensibly to protect U.S. workers from competition — which he said was in keeping with previous periods of lower immigration. It is very hard to disentangle the goal of reducing the overall numbers of immigrant arrivals from the goal of shifting our current ethnic and racial mix. But Trump has now left little to no doubt that the real animating impulse is the latter. * TRUMP’S ‘SHITHOLE’ COMMENT DRAWS GLOBAL CONDEMNATION: The Post tallies up all the criticism pouring in from around the world: We are only beginning to glimpse the damage that Trump is doing to America’s standing in the world. * TRUMP JUST WEAKENED HIS OWN LEVERAGE: NBC News’s Jonathan Allen notes that Trump’s “shithole” comments may have made it harder for him to get a deal on the dreamers, meaning he’ll now have to give up more: He really is the greatest dealmaker, believe me. * JEFF FLAKE DEFENDS DEMOCRATS: Trump tweeted last night that Democrats “seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country.” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) responded: People scoff at Flake for voting with Trump and the GOP, but this sort of thing actually has some value — we need more Republicans defending the norms that Trump is shredding. * TRUMP’S LANGUAGE IS UNFIT FOR CHILDREN: Jake Tapper actually had to say this on CNN, in his introduction to a segment on Trump’s “shithole” comments: “Parents with children, you might want to mute for the next 35 seconds.” This is what we’ve come to, folks. * IMMIGRATION DEAL FACES TOUGHER ROAD IN HOUSE: Senators have reached a deal in principle to protect the dreamers that includes some limits on family-based immigration and border security. But as CNN’s Lauren Fox points out: It seems obvious that a deal can pass only with a lot of Democrats, so the trick for Democratic leaders will be to thread the needle by keeping just enough Dems on board to offset the conservatives who vote no. * PAUL RYAN EXPLAINS WHITE HOUSE POSITION TO TRUMP: Trump yesterday got confused and tweeted opposition to a surveillance bill supported by the White House and most Republicans. The Post reports on what came next: Remember when conservative pundits and some reporters were telling us how Trump’s ability to sit through an immigration meeting showcased his blazing competence? * REPUBLICANS TELL THEMSELVES EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE: The Washington Examiner reports on the state of mind among Republicans as they contemplate the coming midterm elections: This is another aspect of the Trump Effect: Even though the national polls were actually pretty close to right, his win must mean that there’s no reason to take any polling seriously. #FakePolls The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "urls": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/18/how-2020-election-was-closer-than-2016/",
        "articles": "As President Trump refuses to concede that he lost the election, and his dead-enders trot out increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories and legal tantrums, we are witnessing an attack on democracy that is at turns sickening and comical. But as it turns more the latter than the former, we should be aware of how close we came to catastrophe. You may look at President-elect Joe Biden’s 306-to-232 lead in the electoral college, and his popular vote lead of 5.8 million votes and growing, and say that, thankfully, the results weren’t that close. As my colleague Greg Sargent wrote before the election, Trump’s legal strategy was predicated on getting within “cheating distance,” with the margins narrow enough that he could convince Republican judges to intercede on his behalf and hand him the election. It hasn’t happened. But it was closer than you think. And it raises the frightening possibility that if Trump’s team were not such a bunch of buffoons, and if Republican officials at the state level were just a little more corrupt than they already are, he might have been able to steal the election after all. That’s because the 2020 election was, in one critical way, even closer than 2016. You may remember that four years ago, Trump managed to win the electoral college because he prevailed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by a combined total of just 77,000 votes. That tiny margin was enough to overcome Hillary Clinton’s 3 million-vote lead in the popular vote and make him president with 304 electoral votes. In the time since, Democrats have cited that number over and over, often as proof of the Clinton campaign’s strategic missteps. How hard would it have been to grab 77,000 more votes? Couldn’t they have done it with a few more visits to those states? So what’s the analogous magic number for 2020? It’s even smaller. Final tallies are being completed; Georgia is conducting a hand recount, and there could be a recount in Wisconsin if the Trump campaign decides to pay for one. But here are the margins by which Biden won three critical states, as of Wednesday morning: If we’re thinking about whether Trump could make up any of those deficits in a recount, the answer is almost certainly no; recounts seldom find mistakes that move more than a few hundred votes in one direction or another, and could just as easily make Biden’s leads larger. But if Trump had managed to get those 45,000 votes, he would have won 37 more electoral votes, making the electoral college a 269-to-269 tie. Under the Constitution, the election would have then been decided by the House of Representatives, with each state delegation getting just one vote. Even though Democrats have a majority in the House, more state delegations have Republican majorities. Trump would have been reelected. That’s the bullet we just dodged, all because of 45,000 votes. Which raises the question of whether Trump might still be able to convince election officials and courts to toss out enough Democratic votes to pull it off. The answer at this point is plainly no. The simple reason is that there are no grounds to do so and no fraud to be found (despite Republicans’ efforts). The suits they have filed around the country have been almost laughed out of court — but they’re still trying. On Tuesday, the Trump campaign filed suit in Nevada asking that Biden’s 34,000-vote victory simply be nullified and the state’s electoral votes be awarded to Trump or at least given to neither candidate. In Pennsylvania, the increasingly unhinged Rudolph W. Giuliani, appearing in court for the first time in decades, made an utter fool out of himself; as the Associated Press described his performance, “Over the next several hours, he fiddled with his Twitter account, forgot which judge he was talking to and threw around wild, unsupported accusations about a nationwide conspiracy by Democrats to steal the election.” And in Michigan, the Republican members of the elections board of Wayne County, which includes Detroit, initially refused to certify the results; one of them said that she’d be willing to certify those from cities other than Detroit. It was a momentary lifting of the veil, as the GOP’s belief that the votes of Black people are inherently illegitimate became disturbingly explicit. After an outpouring of protest, the two Republicans relented and certified the results. But had they been more committed to giving Trump the election at all costs, we could have eventually found ourselves in the situation many feared, in which a state’s Republican legislature simply decided to grant its electoral votes to Trump no matter what the voters wanted. And if one state’s GOP legislature did it, others might have, too. The legislatures in Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia are all controlled by Republicans. At this point, it isn’t going to happen. But what if, say, Trump had won Arizona and Georgia (which would have taken just 25,000 votes combined), and it was all up to Wisconsin? Would the Republican legislators who engineered the country’s most brutal partisan gerrymander have respected the will of the voters enough not to just hand Trump the election? Fortunately, we won’t have to find out. But the fact that we came so close shows us how fragile this system is. Until we find a way to fix it, we’ll always live with the threat of the kind of stolen election Trump is still hoping he can pull off. Read more: Paul Waldman: Trump will leave office soon.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old No pressure, Colorado and Washington, but the world is scrutinizing your every move. That was the take-home message of an event today at the Brookings Institution, discussing the international impact of the move toward marijuana legalization at the state-level in the U.S. Laws passed in Colorado and Washington, with other states presumably to come, create a tension with the U.S. obligations toward three major international treaties governing drug control. Historically the U.S. has been a strong advocate of all three conventions, which \"commit the United States to punish and even criminalize activity related to recreational marijuana,\" according to Brookings' Wells Bennet. The U.S. response to this tension has thusfar been to call for more \"flexibility\" in how countries interpret them. This policy was made explicit in recent remarks by Assistant Secretary of State William Brownfield, who last week at the United Nations said that \"we have to be tolerant of different countries, in response to their own national circumstances and conditions, exploring and using different national drug control policies.\" He went on: \"How could I, a representative of the Government of the United States of America, be intolerant of a government that permits any experimentation with legalization of marijuana if two of the 50 states of the United States of America have chosen to walk down that road?\" As far as policy stances go this is an aggressively pragmatic solution. The federal government lacks the resources and perhaps the political will to crack down on the legalization states, but it also likely doesn't want to openly admit that it's allowing regulation regimes that openly contradict the provisions of major treaties. By saying that those treaties allow for interpretation, the government is attempting to carve out some space to allow legalization experiments to continue with minimal boat-rocking. But as Wells Bennet and John Walsh of the Washington Office on Latin America write in a new Brookings report, that position will \"rapidly become implausible and unsustainable if legalization spreads and succeeds.\" At today's event, Martin Jelsma of the Transnational Institute, an international think tank, agreed: \"The U.S. is hesitant to acknowledge that the legal regulation [of marijuana] is a direct violation of the treaty system... you have reached the limit of what you can defend applying the most flexible interpretation of the treaty system.\" As a result, the panelists at the event were in agreement that it's time to explore a multilateral reworking of the drug control treaties to better reflect current realities - particularly, to begin the process of re-scheduling marijuana, which international law currently considers one of the most dangerous drugs(despite decades of evidence to the contrary). Sandeep Chawla, former deputy director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, called the current restrictions on marijuana \"the weakest point of this whole control system, something that has been obvious for 30 years.\" He noted that one of the main obstacles to meaningful reform is layers of entrenched drug control bureaucracies at the international and national levels - just in the U.S., think of the DEA, ONDCP and NIDA, among others - for whom a relaxation of drug control laws represents an undermining of their reason for existence: \"if you create a bureaucracy to solve a particular problem, when the problem is solved that bureaucracy is out of a job,\" he explained. Lisa Sanchez, a program manager at México Unido Contra la Delincuencia, a Mexican non-profit devoted to promoting \"security, legality and justice,\" underscored how legalization efforts in the U.S. are having powerful ripple effects across the globe: events in Colorado and Washington have \"created political space for Latin American countries to have a real debate [about drug policy].\" She noted that motivations for reform in Latin America are somewhat different than U.S. motivations - one main driver is a need to address the epidemic of violence on those countries that is fueled directly by prohibitionist drug war policies. Many countries are now taking a close look at what's happening in the states to learn lessons that can be applied to their own situations. And so far, the news coming out of Colorado and Washington is overwhelmingly positive: dire consequences predicted by reform opponents have failed to materialize. If anything, societal and economic indicators are moving in a positive direction post-legalization. Colorado marijuana tax revenues for fiscal year 2014-2015 are on track to surpass projections. Countries, particularly in Latin America, are starting to apply these lessons in order to craft smarter policies that reduce violence and other societal harms brought about by the drug war. Uruguay, for instance, has moved toward full national legalization of marijuana, with an eye toward reducing the thriving black market there. Mexico's president has given signs he's open to changes in that country's marijuana laws to help combat cartel violence. The Organization of American States recently issued a statement in favor of dealing with drug use as a public health issue, rather than a criminal justice one. Regardless the eventual direction of marijuana legalization in the U.S., steps toward reform here are already prompting other countries to seek out more pragmatic solutions to their drug problems.

        "articles": "Correction: An earlier version of this story, published Thursday, incorrectly reported that One America News was warned by the FBI that it was the target of a Russian influence operation. That version also said the FBI had provided a similar warning to Rudolph W. Giuliani, which he has since disputed. This version has been corrected to remove assertions that OAN and Giuliani received the warnings. The FBI became aware in late 2019 that Rudolph W. Giuliani was the target of a Russian influence operation aimed at circulating falsehoods intended to damage President Biden politically ahead of last year’s election, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials planned to warn Giuliani as part of an extensive effort by the bureau to alert members of Congress and at least one conservative media outlet, One America News, that they faced a risk of being used to further Russia’s attempt to influence the election’s outcome, said several current and former U.S. officials. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter remains highly sensitive. The FBI became aware of the Russian information operation at a time when Giuliani was deeply involved with former president Donald Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign and related activities in Ukraine to surface unflattering or incriminating information about the Biden family. The revelation comes as the FBI this week seized Giuliani’s cellphone and other electronic devices as part of a long-running criminal investigation into whether the onetime New York mayor and personal attorney for Trump acted as an unregistered foreign agent. The FBI executes a search warrant at Rudy Giuliani’s home The plan to warn potential targets was separate from the Justice Department’s ongoing criminal probe of Giuliani, but it reflects a broader concern by U.S. intelligence and federal investigators that he — among other influential Americans and U.S. institutions — was being manipulated by the Russian government to promote its interests. Giuliani traveled in December 2019 to Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, where he met with a Ukrainian lawmaker whom the U.S. government later labeled “an active Russian agent” and sanctioned on grounds he was running an “influence campaign” against Biden. That operation, officials said, involved Ukrainian officials and political consultants who the U.S. intelligence community has since concluded were acting as Russian proxies not only to smear Biden and derail his candidacy but also to curtail U.S. support for Ukraine. On Friday, following the initial publication of this report, Giuliani denied he was contacted by the FBI about Russia’s disinformation campaign. One America News President Charles Herring said Friday the network was never contacted by the FBI “regarding Ukraine or people associated with Ukraine.” An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment. The FBI last summer also gave what is known as a defensive briefing to Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who ahead of the election used his perch as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to investigate Biden’s dealings with Ukraine while he was vice president and his son Hunter Biden held a lucrative seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, recalled receiving a vague warning from FBI briefers in August, but he said Thursday that there was no substance to their cautionary message and that he did not view the meeting as a “defensive briefing” on his oversight of the Biden family’s foreign business ventures. “Regarding reports that I received an FBI briefing warning me that I was a target of Russian disinformation, I can confirm I received such a briefing in August of 2020,” Johnson said in a statement to The Washington Post. “I asked the briefers what specific evidence they had regarding this warning, and they could not provide me anything other than the generalized warning. Without specific information, I felt the briefing was completely useless and unnecessary (since I was fully aware of the dangers of Russian disinformation). “Because there was no substance to the briefing, and because it followed the production and leaking of a false intelligence product by Democrat leaders, I suspected that the briefing was being given to be used at some future date for the purpose that it is now being used: to offer the biased media an opportunity to falsely accuse me of being a tool of Russia despite warnings.” Johnson and staffers to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), another Trump ally in the Senate who aided Johnson with his probe, said that in separate briefings earlier in 2020, FBI officials assured them there was no reason to discontinue their inquiry into Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine. It is not the bureau’s place to tell lawmakers what to investigate or not, or whether to stop or start an investigation, former FBI officials said. The senators suspected that the younger Biden’s position with the Ukrainian firm posed a conflict of interest to his father’s role shaping U.S. policy toward Ukraine and created impediments for U.S.-backed anti-corruption efforts in that country. Their investigation ended last fall with a report concluding that Hunter Biden’s position with Burisma was “problematic” but did not influence his father’s work or Obama administration policy toward Ukraine. GOP senators’ report calls Hunter Biden’s board position with Ukraine firm ‘problematic’ but doesn’t show it changed U.S. policy Defensive briefings are given to people to alert them that they are being targeted by foreign governments for malign purposes, former officials said. But they’re also used “to see how they respond to that,” said Frank Figliuzzi, a former senior FBI counterintelligence official. “They’re now on notice.” Giuliani’s electronic devices were seized by authorities Wednesday in searches of his Manhattan home and office as part of the federal investigation into whether he acted as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukraine. The probe centers on Giuliani’s interactions with Ukrainian figures ahead of November’s election, as he sought information that might undermine Joe Biden and lobbied for the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine while also pressing Ukrainian officials to announce an inquiry into Biden. Trump abruptly removed the ambassador in May 2019, but Ukraine did not launch an investigation into the Bidens. Giuliani, a former Manhattan U.S. attorney, has emphatically denied any wrongdoing, and his attorney on Wednesday accused federal investigators of ignoring “clear evidence” of what he alleged was Hunter Biden’s “failure to register as a foreign agent” and the Biden family taking “millions in bribes to sell [Biden’s] public offices.” Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert J. Costello, has said Giuliani never peddled disinformation on the Bidens. During his December 2019 trip to Kyiv, Giuliani was accompanied by a team from One America News, which has described itself as one of Trump’s “greatest supporters.” The network later produced a documentary series based on the trip. The network expressed pride in its investigation of the Bidens in Ukraine. “We stand by our reporting highlighting Hunter Biden’s financial windfall relationship with Burisma and VP Joe Biden’s efforts to have a Prosecutor General fired to protect alleged wrongdoing by his son, Hunter,” the network said in a statement, referring to unproven allegations made by some Ukrainian officials. The statement acknowledged that the Treasury Department sanctioned a Ukrainian lawmaker interviewed by the network last year. But, the statement said, “OAN’s interviews were prior to the sanctions and the reasons for sanctions were unknown to OAN at the time of the interviews.” U.S. sanctions Ukrainian lawmaker tied to Giuliani as ‘active Russian agent’ On his trip to Kyiv, Giuliani met with Andriy Derkach, a politician sanctioned by the United States in September and accused by the Treasury Department of having been an active Russian agent “for over a decade” and maintaining “close connections with Russian intelligence services.” Derkach, who attended a KGB academy in Moscow, has denied involvement with any foreign intelligence agency and any illegal activities. In late 2019, before Giuliani’s trip to Kyiv, U.S. intelligence agencies warned the Trump White House that Giuliani was the target of a Russian influence operation, as The Post reported last year. Officials became concerned after obtaining evidence, including communications intercepts, that showed Giuliani was interacting with people tied to Russian intelligence. The warnings led then-national security adviser Robert C. O’Brien to caution Trump that any information Giuliani brought back from Ukraine should be considered contaminated by Russia. Giuliani met with Derkach again in New York in February 2020 when he hosted Derkach on a podcast. In the podcast, Derkach aired false allegations that billions of dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine were misused or went missing while Joe Biden was handling the Obama administration’s Ukraine portfolio. Costello has said Giuliani did not rely on Derkach for material. Since Biden’s victory, the National Intelligence Council, an analytic arm of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, has concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin and other senior officials in Moscow sought to influence the 2020 election. They did so by spreading misleading information about Biden through prominent individuals, “including some” who were “close to former President Trump,” according to an ODNI report issued in March. Putin targeted people close to Trump in bid to influence 2020 election, U.S. intelligence says The report did not identify the individuals by name, but several current and former officials confirmed at the time that Giuliani was among them. The primary narrative that the Kremlin sought to promote — alleging corrupt ties between the Bidens and Ukraine — dated back to at least 2014, the intelligence report said. To distance themselves from the disinformation, the Russian spy services relied on Ukrainian individuals including Derkach, the report said. Derkach and others “sought to use prominent U.S. persons and media conduits to launder their narratives to U.S. officials and audiences,” the report stated. “These Russian proxies met with and provided materials to Trump administration-linked U.S. persons to advocate for formal investigation . . . and attempted to make contact with several senior U.S. officials.” Johnson has said he never met or spoke with Derkach. But he and his staff met with another Ukrainian national, former diplomat Andriy Telizhenko, who pushed the unfounded allegation that it was Ukraine rather than Russia that interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. Johnson has not discussed the meeting publicly. Last year, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) alleged that Johnson was seeking to “give credibility” to disinformation advanced by Derkach and Telizhenko “for the sole purpose” of aiding Trump’s reelection. Johnson has said his staff vetted the reliability of Telizhenko’s information and rejected Wyden’s assertion. As part of his committee’s investigation, Johnson and two Republican colleagues considered subpoenaing Telizhenko to testify. At Senate Democrats’ request, the FBI in March 2020 briefed Johnson’s panel and two other committees on Telizhenko’s background and motives. As a result, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers urged Johnson to refrain from issuing the subpoena. Telizhenko also has met several times with Giuliani, appearing on his podcast and facilitating his December 2019 trip to Ukraine. This past January, in the waning days of the Trump administration, the Treasury Department sanctioned Telizhenko as well for his role in trying to influence the 2020 election. He has denied any involvement in Russian interference or disinformation operations and denied working with Derkach. This month, the Biden administration imposed economic sanctions on 32 entities and individuals for Russian government attempts to influence November’s election. David L. Stern in Kyiv, and Paul Sonne and Alice Crites in Washington contributed to this report. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old In Bill O’Reilly’s world, friends excuse friends for being racist. The King of Cable News is a good old pal of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. They’ve attended ballgames together. They’ve shared an untold number of vanilla milkshakes. They’re so tight that O’Reilly at one point used his association with Trump to put rival Ted Cruz in his place. “I’ve known him for about 30 years. I think he’s an honest man,” said O’Reilly. Settled! Considering that O’Reilly would deliver such an endorsement of a proven liar, his handling of the latest Trump controversy will surprise no one. In recent days, Trump has come under fire for asserting that the judge presiding over lawsuits against Trump University — Judge Gonzalo Curiel — has “an absolute conflict” because of his Mexican heritage. “He’s proud of his his heritage. I respect him for that,” Trump told CNN’s Jake Tapper last week. “He’s a Mexican. We’re building a wall between here and Mexico.” Curiel was born in Indiana, making him not “a Mexican.” Reasonable people on both sides of this country’s political divide have condemned Trump’s argument that a judge cannot do his work because of his heritage — an argument that is bigoted, racist, misanthropic and dumb. O’Reilly is not one of those reasonable people. On his program last night, he attempted a a delicate rhetorical operation in which he called for Curiel’s recusal from the case without repeating Trump’s rationale word for word. Here’s how O’Reilly worded his independence from Trump in his signature “Talking Points” memo: “Summing up, the Trump U. case is certainly political to some extent and it’s a very high profile situation. Because of that, Talking Points believes the judge should recuse himself. Not because he did anything wrong; he didn’t. But to eliminate any doubt as to the motivation in court rulings. There are plenty of federal judges that could immediately step in. It is valid that some may see any recusal as caving to intimidation, but stark justice in a case this important trumps — pardon the pun — any theoretical argument.” Let’s lay out this un-theoretical argument: With those words, O’Reilly is explicitly following Trump into a racist abyss, one where an upstanding federal judge stands accused, somehow, of political biases just because of his ancestry. In nearly a year of campaign-trail outrages, this is one of Trump’s most sinister offenses — straight-up prejudice masquerading as highfalutin ethics. Ignorance of court precedent enters the mix as well. As Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick wrote, “Despite multiple sad efforts to conflict out black and female judges in discrimination cases in the late 1970s and ’80s—and more recent efforts to conflict out a gay judge in a marriage equality case—courts have consistently ruled judges are no more inherently biased if they are black, or female, or gay than they would be inherently fair if they were white, or male, or straight.” O’Reilly could use a training session on just what constitutes a conflict of interest. One legal site defines it as follows: Please, O’Reilly, enlighten us on how Curiel’s situation aligns with that definition. To understand O’Reilly’s sophistication on media ethics, consider that in mid-May, the host claimed that Megan Twohey, who co-wrote a critical New York Times piece on Trump’s treatment of women, was unqualified to work on the story because, well, let O’Reilly explain it: “The problem is Megan Twohey is a feminist, or so it seems,” said O’Reilly (we have no idea whether she’s a feminist). “The reason I even mention feminism in connection with reporting on Donald Trump is that his resume goes against that ideology. For example, Mr. Trump, as we all know, ran beauty contests. He referred to women as ‘Trump girls’ and has been flamboyant in his interactions with the opposite sex.” So only anti-feminist supporters of beauty contests and people who are okay with so-called “Trump girls” can report on Trump’s treatment of women. If only O’Reilly applied his own standards of ethical purity to his own work: What would he say about a journalist covering frequently and approvingly on a longtime pal? We may never know. Next time O’Reilly wants a little insight on conflicts of interest, he should take to heart what his colleague Megyn Kelly said on her program last night: “You can’t create a conflict of interest about a judge just by complaining about him.” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Something notable happened Tuesday in Congress, but you probably missed it. And this is extremely relevant to the debate roiling the Democratic Party right now, about whether to impeach President Trump, how to confront him from now until next November if they don’t impeach him and exactly what argument Democrats should present to the voters as they make their case to be given control of the federal government. Here’s what happened: Republicans, including even Trump, have at various times claimed to want to give \"dreamers\" a path to citizenship (though Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, putting them in limbo). But this bill will not be taken up in the Senate, because Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) doesn’t particularly care. That makes the bill largely symbolic (though symbols can be important). Because journalists know that the bill won’t become law anytime soon, they don’t treat this as a particularly newsworthy event. The Post, which covers the federal government more comprehensively than nearly any other news organization, wrote that article about it. But most outlets ignored it entirely. So what does that have to do with impeachment and the 2020 election? One key argument against impeaching Trump is that the spectacle would distract attention from issues that favor Democrats. As political theorist Rob Goodman put it in a recent opinion piece, impeachment “would focus voters on the Trump Tower meeting instead of student loan forgiveness, the firing of James Comey instead of protecting and building on Obamacare.” The problem is that public attention doesn’t operate according to that kind of zero-sum equation. If it did, right now — because there’s no impeachment going on — the airwaves would be humming with intense policy discussions, and around every water cooler voters would be passionately debating the merits of the Democrats’ latest proposal on health care or student loans. But they aren’t. Not impeaching Trump doesn’t force the media and the voters to “focus” on policy issues. Adam Jentleson, a former aide to Sen. Harry Reid, explained this well: There are other reasons one might oppose opening an impeachment inquiry; I don’t find them particularly persuasive, but you may disagree. There is no reason to believe, however, that setting aside impeachment will allow Democrats to focus everyone’s attention on their preferred policy issues. As Jentleson says, what gets attention are events. And not just that, but events that are inherently controversial. The dreamers bill passing the House is an event, but it’s missing the elements that will lead news organizations to give it featured coverage: the potential for fighting between the parties, an uncertain outcome, the revelation of new information, or some kind of meaningful change that puts the “new” in “news.” Republicans are barely bothering to argue against it, because they know that for the moment it will fall into the yawning void of McConnell’s Senate, never to be heard from again as long as he’s in control. That doesn’t mean that impeachment is the only way Democrats can grab the attention of the news media and the public. Unfortunately, we sometimes act as if their only choices are impeaching the president or sitting on their hands. What they can do is forcefully use the power they have in the House, just as Republicans did when they had that power. You may recall that the reason we learned that Hillary Clinton used a private email system while she was secretary of state was that it emerged in the eighth, yes, eighth investigation they mounted of the tragedy in Benghazi. As I wrote on Tuesday, we’re finally going to get hearings in the Intelligence and Judiciary committees on the Mueller report, which is an excellent start. Yet for some reason, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) has been dragging his feet on getting Trump’s tax returns. Though he has requested the federal returns, he seems in no particular hurry to confront the administration’s stonewalling. In fact, New York state just passed a law to provide the president’s state returns to Congress upon request, but Neal has refused to request them. Why? As Bloomberg reports, “Neal has said he fears that getting the state returns would bolster Trump administration arguments that Congress is on a political fishing expedition.” Oh, well forget it then. To be clear, even if they can’t become law, Democrats should keep passing bills like the one to protect the dreamers. They set a marker of what the party stands for and can be easily brought up again once they can actually be turned into law. But if Democrats want to use the power they have in the House to do something substantively worthwhile and make Trump’s defeat in 2020 more likely, they’re going to have to get much more aggressive.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old From calling for raising middle-class wages to announcing a plan to share corporate profits with workers and go after Wall Street criminals, Hillary Clinton gave a remarkably populist/liberal speech Monday laying out her economic policies. The 2016 Democratic frontrunner is highlighting her progressive bona fides on everything from social to economic issues as she contrasts herself with an increasingly conservative Republican field. But she's also facing a stronger-than-expected challenge from the left in the form of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The socialist is drawing large crowds across the country with his populist Robin Hood-style message of taking income from the rich and giving it to the poor and cracking down hard on Wall Street. [7 ways Bernie Sanders will run against Hillary Clinton] Sanders isn't a real threat yet to her path to the nomination, but Clinton most certainly had his adoring crowds in the back of her mind as she laid out her campaign's major economic policy points. Here's four ways she tried to differentiate herself from Sanders. 1. She's focusing more on policies to lift up women Key quote: \"For far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women's issues. Well, those days are over.\" What she said: This time around, Clinton is making her potential history-making run for the White House a major theme of her candidacy. And she spent a good chunk of her time Monday at the progressive New School talking about how as president she'd implement specific federal policies to make it easier for women to work, such as fair pay laws and expanding access to child care and paid sick leave. Why its different from Sanders: Sanders has advocated for similar policies, including 12-week paid maternity leave, but he doesn't spent as much time as Clinton talking about gender policy. And that makes some sense: Clinton has the potential to make history, and Sanders is doing a lot better among white liberal men, the polls show. [OK now Hillary Clinton is starting to have some problems in Iowa] 2. Wall Street deserves scrutiny, but it's not evil Key quote: \"I know firsthand the role that Wall Street can and should play in our economy helping main street grow and prosper.\" What she said: Clinton certainly tried to appeal to the left-wing of her party by criticizing Wall Street as too focused on short-term, quarterly profits instead of America's long-term economic health. She promised to criminally prosecute Wall Street CEOS responsible for trading that led to the 2008 financial crisis, and she called for policies to rein in such trading, such as taxing risky high-frequency trading. But the former New York senator refused to vilify Wall Street as the over-arching reason Americans are hurting today. Why it's different from Sanders: Sanders, by contrast, has made Wall Street one of his top enemies. \"I think these people are so greedy, they're so out of touch with reality,\" he told CNBC's John Harwood in May. Sanders is promising a \"revolution\" to redistribute -- and he does use that word -- wealth from the top 1 percent to the masses. A key part of his plan is to break up big banks on Wall Street and raise taxes on the rich. [Bernie Sanders would run for president against Wall Street, not Hillary Clinton] 3. Progressiveness is good, but blind ideology is bad Key quote: \"Let's get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology.\" What she said: Clinton ended her speech with what sounded almost like a plea to stop campaigning on purely partisan politics, which she blamed for creating Washington gridlock. Of course, she pitched herself as the candidate to do just that. \"I want to have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together,\" she said. Why it's different from Sanders: While certainly criticizing Republicans here too, this part of her speech could almost be read as a direct shot at Sanders. His call to break up big banks and significantly raise the income tax rate is seen by establishment Democrats as just not politically viable. And on Sunday, Sanders seemed to make the case that Democrats shouldn't work with Republicans. 4. Everything she left out of the speech Sanders-supporting liberals were closely watching Clinton on Monday to see if she'd stake out even more liberal positions on trade and minimum wage and welfare. But Clinton probably left those folks wanting. She did not talk about expanding Social Security, she did not call for raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour, and she did not explicitly disapprove of President Obama's trade deals with Pacific Rim nations and Europe. So while she is pivoting to the left more than any other modern Democratic presidential candidate, what Sanders said Sunday on CBS's \"Face The Nation\" still holds true about the two candidates: \"There are very significant differences of opinion that we have.\" [This post has been updated to reflect Sen.

Bernie Sanders speak. The picture above, from a Sanders rally in Los Angeles on Monday night, shows a reported 27,500 people gathered to \"feel the Bern.\" (Worth noting: That crowd estimate comes from the Sanders campaign, so take it cum grano salis.) That's a stunning number of people to hear ANY candidate at ANY time during ANY election cycle. Much less a major underdog for the Democratic nomination in the year before an election. So, how does Sanders do it? This from WaPo's Ed O'Keefe and John Wagner: That sort of organic passion and energy is the sort of thing that any politician -- especially one named Hillary Clinton -- would love to have at their back. (As O'Keefe and Wagner note, the largest crowd Clinton has had in this campaign is 5,500.) Sanders has it -- big time. That doesn't mean he beats Clinton for the nomination. Or even comes close. But it does mean that something is going on out there. Sanders's populist, anti-Wall Street message is resonating. Crowds the size he gets don't lie. And they shouldn't be ignored.

        "articles": "President Biden on Wednesday dismissed the pledge by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that his top priority is to stop the administration’s ambitious spending plans, insisting that he will push for compromise and achieve his goals. “He said that about the last administration — about Barack, that he was going to stop everything — and I was able to get a lot done with him,” the president said in response to questions at the White House. Earlier in the day, McConnell (R-Ky.) had told reporters that Biden is supporting policies that would turn the United States into a socialist country, a frequent line of attack from the right that the president and other Democrats reject as false. “One hundred percent of my focus is on stopping this new administration,” McConnell said during an appearance in Georgetown, Ky. “I think the best way to look at what this new administration is: The president may have won the nomination, but Bernie Sanders won the argument.” McConnell’s comments about the Biden administration were reminiscent of those he made just before the 2010 midterm elections stating that the main priority for Republicans was to ensure President Barack Obama did not get reelected. “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,” McConnell told the National Journal. Long-standing ties between Biden and McConnell could shape early agenda Throughout the presidential campaign, Biden focused on his record of working with Republicans on bipartisan legislation during his decades in the Senate and later in negotiations with McConnell during his tenure as vice president. But his talk of bipartisanship has run headlong into political acrimony and party divisions. No Republican in the House or Senate voted for Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, and the GOP is resisting Biden’s multitrillion-dollar spending plans. At the same time, Republicans have complained that Biden is unwilling to stick to his campaign pledge to reach out to the GOP. Biden said Wednesday that he is open to compromise on his $2 trillion infrastructure and jobs plan but that he stands by his proposal to finance the plan by increasing taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans — an idea Republicans have soundly rejected. “Everything I’m proposing that be done to generate economic growth and employment and put us in a position where we can out-compete any other country in the world with research and development and moving ahead, I pay for,” the president said Wednesday. Republicans have bristled at Biden’s American Jobs Plan, saying the $2 trillion dollar price tag is too high for Americans, especially those earning more than $400,000. While the economic proposal is popular with most Americans, according to surveys, prominent business organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have come out against the effort. Biden criticized Republicans for their 2017 support of tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and said even conservative think tanks noted that those tax breaks did not stimulate the economy the way GOP lawmakers promised. “My Republican friends had no problem voting to pass a tax proposal that expires in 2025 that cost $2 trillion — none of it paid for, increased the deficit by $2 trillion, gave the overwhelming percentage of those tax breaks to people who didn’t need it,” he said. “I’m willing to compromise, but I’m not willing to not pay for what we’re talking about,” Biden said. “I’m not willing to deficit-spend.” Biden said the way to actually increase productivity and stimulate economic growth is to have corporations pay more taxes that will create a million jobs and fund the construction and repair of bridges, highways and other long-neglected infrastructure projects. During a stop in Rhode Island, Vice President Harris was asked about McConnell’s comments. “We are sincere and serious about the potential to actually get something done together,” Harris said. “We believe it’s possible, and we’re not going to give up on that until it becomes evident that it’s not possible.” Read more at PowerPost The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "After nearly a decade of disappointment in the Sunshine State, Democrats are throwing themselves back into the breach with a major effort to topple Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Fox News phenom and potential 2024 presidential contender, in a reelection race that will be a major test of whether Donald Trump’s vision for the Republican Party has staying power in a closely divided state. Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), elected governor of the state as a Republican in 2006, became the first to announce his candidacy Tuesday, declaring that he hoped to “restore civility instead of demonizing those who have a different point of view.” “If we seize this moment, if we take this chance, if we focus on the things that unite us, we can create the Florida we know is possible,” he said. Crist will probably soon be joined by other contenders, possibly including state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only Democrat to recently win statewide, and Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a former House impeachment manager and Orlando police chief who was shortlisted as a potential running mate for President Biden. Demings released a biographical video Tuesday timed to compete with Crist’s announcement, and Fried teased Crist on Twitter by recalling his past praise for her. The emerging Democratic field reflects the party’s enthusiasm for taking power back in Trump’s new home state, a historic bellwether that has shut out Democrats from almost every major contest there since Barack Obama won in 2012 by less than a percentage point. Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison, who recently authorized $20 million in spending in states such as Florida before 2022, has taken to taunting DeSantis on Twitter, while promising that “we are going to be doing everything we can” to defeat him. In a sign of how Democrats plan to campaign next year, Harrison called out DeSantis for opposing Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which sent $1,400 checks to most Florida adults. “Maybe he should call up every one of those Floridians and tell them to give their money back,” Harrison quipped about DeSantis in an interview Monday. Republicans say they expect an onslaught of outside money into the state next year, given DeSantis’s potential as a presidential contender if Trump does not run again. “With Ron DeSantis being discussed as one of the front-runners on the Republican side for 2024, you are going to have a lot of people, liberals, billionaires from blue states, dumping money and human capital into Florida,” said Christian Ziegler, the state GOP vice chairman. “The best way you prevent someone from getting to major leagues is you take him out in the grapefruit league. But the Florida GOP is not going to let that happen.” The Democratic case against DeSantis is expected to aim directly at the emerging identity of the current Republican Party, under the hold of Trump, with its focus on opposition to transgender athletes, new voting restrictions, new laws barring disruptive protests, social media censorship and restrictions on health measures meant to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, all issues that DeSantis has fully embraced in recent weeks. Fried said in an interview that she sees DeSantis as a symptom of a larger realignment in American politics, which will ultimately benefit Democrats in the state. The governor, she said, has moved away from the small-government ethos of the old Republican Party, pointing to a recent $1 billion increase in sales taxes on out-of-state online businesses that DeSantis signed, and a host of state orders he has supported that overrule the autonomy of local governments. “He has gone in an extreme, authoritarian, fascist direction. It is no longer between left and right,” Fried said about the evolution of Florida Republicans during the Trump presidency. “They are now the party of tax and spend and overreaching in government. They just banned transgender girls from sports. I have no idea why government has to get involved in athletics.” Crist hit upon similar themes in his announcement speech, accusing DeSantis of being “mean and cruel to children” by banning transgender athletes in women’s and girls sports. “This is a governor who doesn’t listen, who doesn’t care and doesn’t think about you, unless you can write him a campaign check,” Crist said in a sweltering outdoor speech in St. Petersburg, where his aides set up a personal fan onstage to keep him cooler. “I’m running so you will be in charge again, so you will have a governor who will work for the people with a steady hand.” DeSantis has been riding a recent wave of positive polling and publicity, becoming a frequent guest of Fox News’ prime-time lineup, while adopting a Trumpian taste for staging self-congratulatory public events, where he stands by the lectern as other officials praise his leadership, including an event Monday on Crist’s home turf in St. Petersburg. On Tuesday in Tallahassee, DeSantis welcomed Democratic critiques of his coronavirus response, and joked about Crist having shifted his political identity beginning when he was governor, when he first became an independent and then a Democrat. “Please run on lockdowns,” DeSantis quipped in a news conference, when asked about Crist’s announcement. “I implore them, from my political interest, run on closing schools, run on locking people down, run on closing businesses.” A former Navy attorney, schooled at Yale University and Harvard Law School, DeSantis narrowly won in 2018 after earning the enthusiastic endorsement of Trump and the financial backing of a slew of wealthy GOP kingmakers, including the late casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, investment manager Foster Friess, packaging magnate Richard Uihlein and Rebekah Mercer, the backer of such conservative online outlets as Parler and Breitbart. His term in office has been largely defined by a sometimes rocky response to the coronavirus pandemic. After embracing state lockdowns in the spring of 2020, he later pushed to lift business restrictions before the summer. Cases in Florida subsequently spiked, and his administration once again banned most alcohol sales at bars. By the fall, he had refashioned himself into a defiant national voice urging a quicker reopening, pressing to restart in-person education as other states were hesitating. Florida, with an older average age than most of the country, is 26th in the nation in terms of per capita deaths from covid-19, one spot better than Texas and three spots worse than California. The state’s new covid case rate remains higher than the national average, with only six states reporting higher rates than Florida over the last seven days. “Lockdowns simply don’t work. They only compound the problem,” he wrote in a recent direct-mail fundraising appeal distributed by the state party, which glossed over the fact that his administration had repeatedly supported business shutdowns that appeared to slow the spread of the disease. “Shutting a business will not dictate to a virus how it will spread.” DeSantis appeared to have bounced back from lower approval ratings in the summer of 2020. He led both Fried and Crist by about 10 percentage points in a hypothetical matchup, according to a March survey by Mason-Dixon Polling and Strategy. Crist’s strategists acknowledge that winning the debate over the governor’s response to the coronavirus will be a central mission of his campaign, which could cost $50 million or more for each candidate. “I think fundamentally this race is going to be about defining the difference between these two candidates,” Crist pollster Mike Bocian said, referring to the past and current governors. “If at the end of the day voters come away thinking DeSantis did a good job through the pandemic — which demonstrably he didn’t — then he is going to be hard to beat.” Even some of DeSantis’s detractors, like trial attorney John Morgan, a Democratic donor who funded recent successful statewide initiatives to legalize medical marijuana and institute a $15 minimum wage, say DeSantis has emerged from the depths of the pandemic with a coherent case to take to voters. “He can arguably make the case that he handled it the right way,” Morgan said. “Perception is reality. Whether he was playing Russian roulette with the state of Florida no one will ever know, because the bullet never hit the chamber.” But other Democrats argue that DeSantis’s recent polling numbers are a clear sign of weakness, not strength, and that a backlash to his governance is coming. “Post-disaster approval ratings in Florida generally run 65, 70, 80 percent, and DeSantis is nowhere close to that,” said Kevin Cate, a Democratic consultant who has been advising Fried. “He has kind of cornered himself into this 2024 narrative. It’s just Fox News. If he is focused on winning the Fox News primary, he is taking his eye off the Florida general in 2022.” Florida was a major disappointment for Democrats in the 2020 campaign, with Trump roughly tripling his margin of victory over his Democratic opponent in 2016, despite a late infusion of $100 million in spending from liberal billionaire Mike Bloomberg to support Biden. Democrats, however, have since shown no interest in walking away from the state. “When you have a state that is as close as Florida is, I don’t think you can write it off,” said Jim Margolis, a Democratic consultant to Hillary Clinton and Obama who is now working for Crist. Running as a Democrat, Crist lost a 2014 bid for governor by a single percentage point. In 2018, Democrats running for governor and Senate lost by even narrower margins. The ability of Democrats to return to the margins that allowed for Obama’s victory in 2012 is almost certain to run through South Florida, where Republican arguments about the allegedly “socialist” designs of Biden and Democrats proved damaging in the last presidential race. Democrats admit that they will have to alleviate those perceptions, particularly in Florida’s Cuban and Venezuelan communities. “The opportunity exists with a Democrat in the White House because they have control of the federal government gives them a chance to show how Democrats can perform better than Republicans,” Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi said.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old President Trump has settled on a new character witness for his coronavirus response: Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.). Crenshaw jousted over the weekend with liberal HBO host Bill Maher as Maher laid out a critical timeline of Trump’s response. A clip of that was shared widely by conservative media, and Crenshaw made many of those same points in a Twitter video, which Trump shared Sunday. That video is pinned to the top of Trump’s feed, and the White House blasted it to Republican members of the House and Senate on Monday. In the videos, Crenshaw is measured and calm, coming off as a reasonable defender of Trump rather than a fire-breather. He takes care to say he’s merely defending Trump rather than casting blame on Democrats and the media. But if the video is the best defense of Trump, that says a lot about the state of Trump’s defense — because it includes misrepresentations, incorrect and context-free claims and false choices. Let’s break down the Crenshaw video Trump promoted piece by piece. Jan. 31: Crenshaw says Trump implements China travel restrictions “even though things like the World Health Organization were saying ‘no need to limit trade and movement,’ and they largely criticized President Trump’s travel restrictions.” This is an incorrect summary of the WHO’s comments on travel bans. The headline shown on the screen comes from Reuters on Feb. 3 and says, “WHO chief says widespread travel bans not needed to beat China virus.” In the story, the WHO’s head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, doesn’t say there is “no need” for travel bans at all; he instead says there was no need to “unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade.” He is quoted saying, “We call on all countries to implement decisions that are evidence-based and consistent.” That’s not saying there should be no bans but instead that countries should be judicious with them. Crenshaw also repeated Trump’s claim that the WHO “largely criticized” the president’s travel restrictions; STAT News has found no evidence to bolster that claim. Crenshaw adds it was the “same day, Jan. 31, that Nancy Pelosi proposed the No Ban Act, which would actually stop President Trump from implementing the lifesaving travel restrictions that he did implement.” Pelosi didn’t propose the No Ban Act on Jan. 31. The bill had been introduced by another member a year ago. Nor did she take the action in response to the China restrictions; she had announced days earlier the bill would be taken up in response to reports previewing Trump’s expanded ban on travel from some majority-Muslim countries. What’s more, the No Ban Act wouldn’t “stop President Trump from implementing the lifesaving travel restrictions.” In fact, while the act requires more significant and documented justification for travel bans, it affirms a president’s authority in such cases. Per the language of the bill, if the administration “determines … that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States would undermine the security or public safety of the United States or the preservation of human rights, democratic processes or institutions, or international stability, the President may temporarily … suspend the entry of such aliens or class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or … impose any restrictions on the entry of such aliens that the President deems appropriate.\" Feb. 4: “Let’s not forget that President Trump did talk about the coronavirus in the State of the Union on Feb. 4. What happened to that State of the Union? That happened.” (Video plays of Pelosi ripping up her copy of the speech after Trump finished.) Crenshaw notably doesn’t relay what Trump actually said about the virus in his State of the Union. In the speech, Trump said, “We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China. My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.” It was among comments around that time in which Trump played up the coordination between the two countries, even as figures within his administration were privately bemoaning the lack of cooperation from China. It’s also worth noting that just about all of Trump’s other comments around this time downplayed the actual threat. “Fast forward a couple weeks when the president actually asked Congress for supplemental funding to combat the virus. What did Nancy Pelosi do? Instead of putting that money on the House floor to be voted on, she put a bill to ban flavored tobacco.” As PolitiFact has noted, there were ongoing negotiations about the funding package until early March. The Trump administration also asked for the funding on Feb. 24, when the bill on flavored tobacco and vaping products already was on the agenda. The GOP-controlled Senate at the time was taking up antiabortion-rights bills. March 12: Trump announced Europe restrictions, which Crenshaw said prompted “widespread criticism. ‘How could you do this?’ ‘What’s the point of this?’ Well, does this really sound like an administration that’s in denial about this? Of course not.” In making this point, Crenshaw showed headlines raising questions about the Europe ban Trump announced. Most of those headlines weren’t questioning the need for the ban. Instead, they pointed to the selective nature of the countries involved — i.e. exempting some countries in which Trump has businesses interests — or simply reported that the European Union objected to the ban, rather than journalists taking positions themselves. Here are the headlines Crenshaw used: Again, it’s another great example of misconstruing the actual resistance to Trump’s travel restrictions. “This is the main point here: If we’re going to look back in time and try to suggest that our government should have shut everything down back in February, well, where’s the evidence for that? Were we really going to shut things down when our cases hadn’t really started to increase — when it barely started to increase in places like Italy or Iran? Of course not, they didn’t shut things down until way later.” This is a false choice that Trump has referred to repeatedly. It pretends as if the decision was between the little that the federal government did in February and a total shutdown of the country. In fact, there were few calls for a shutdown in February — when, as Crenshaw notes, even countries that were hit harder at the time than the United States hadn’t taken that step. Trump has sought to suggest critics wanted things shut down in January, despite there being very few cases at the time. The fact that Crenshaw concluded with this says plenty about the aim of his video.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old CLAREMONT, N.H. - Hillary Rodham Clinton accused Republican opponent Gov. Scott Walker of gutting public education programs in Wisconsin and challenged Republicans on Tuesday to confront what she calls a crisis of rising college tuition and rising debt for students. Speaking to supporters and undecided voters at a community college here, Clinton also mocked the Republican field and jokingly praised dutiful voters who made it through the entire Republican debate last week. The evening Thursday included a session with second-tier candidates, followed by the two-hour debate with the top 10 candidates. \"I bet some of you might have sat through four hours and 17 candidates of debates,\" Clinton said in a tone of mock condolence. \"Really, I admire you,\" she said to laughter. \"It's part of being in New Hampshire,\" with its first-in-the-nation primary next February, Clinton added. \"I know you've got an obligation.\" She then turned serious. \"But if you haven't seen it, there was not one word from one of those candidates about making college affordable or dealing with debt,\" Clinton said. \"I think this is a major challenge, and I want us to address it. Not one word from the other side.\" Clinton is spending much of this week rolling out a new $350 billion proposal to alleviate college debt. Republicans have called the plan, released Monday, expensive and unworkable. \"Then you take somebody like Governor Walker of Wisconsin, who seems to be delighting in slashing the investment in higher education in his state and making it more difficult for students to get scholarships or to pay off their debt,\" Clinton continued. A day before entering the 2016 race in July, Walker signed a state budget that would cut $250 million from the University of Wisconsin and reduce funding for kindergarten through 12th grade. He also approved an expansion of the state’s voucher program that uses public funds to pay for tuition at private and parochial schools. Walker said then that the budget “brings real reform to Wisconsin and allows everyone more opportunity for a brighter future. ” On Tuesday, he fired back in a signed message via Twitter. \"I've frozen in-state tuition rates for four years, while you charged colleges $225k+ just to show up. -SW\" he wrote. That was a reference to Clinton's speaking fees after she left the State Department. She charged some universities and organizations $225,000 and up, although she also waived her speaking fee at times. Walker is among a handful of the better-known Republicans whom Clinton has taken to criticizing by name. Florida's Sen. Marco Rubio and former governor Jeb Bush have come under for similar treatment recently. Appearing Tuesday on \"Fox & Friends,\" Walker said he would prefer to focus on Clinton rather than take shots at the GOP front-runner, Donald Trump. \"What I'm going to do instead of doing what Donald Trump is, and that's attacking other Republicans, I'm going to focus, as I did in the debate, on Hillary Clinton,\" Walker said. \"She's the real opponent. She's the one that would be a disaster. Much bigger disaster than even Barack Obama, if anybody can think that's possible.\" The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Doug Preszler wasn’t thinking about risk when he took a cashier job at a regional supermarket in eastern Iowa. But five months in, he has found himself at the forefront of a global crisis with little training or protection — save for the pocket-size bottle of hand sanitizer and Ziploc full of disposable gloves he brings from home each day. The 51-year-old has told himself not to live in fear yet concedes he increasingly is. Even the most routine tasks are fraught: Accepting bills and giving change scare him the most, Preszler says. And he has run through so much hand sanitizer that his skin is cracking. “I’ve been way more anxious this week,” he said. “They’ve started telling people, ‘Go to the grocery store as little as possible.’ And yet I’m going there every day.” Next to health-care providers, no workforce has proved more essential during the novel coronavirus pandemic than the 3 million U.S. grocery store employees who restock shelves and freezers, fill online orders and keep checkout lines moving. Although the public health guidelines are clear — steer clear of others — these workers are putting in longer shifts and taking on bigger workloads. Many report being stressed and scared, especially as their colleagues fall ill to the highly contagious coronavirus that is responsible for more than 21,000 deaths in the United States alone. Some liken their job to working in a war zone, knowing that the simple act of showing up to work could ultimately kill them. At least 41 grocery workers have died so far. They include a Trader Joe’s employee in New York, a Safeway worker in Seattle, a pair of Walmart associates near Chicago and four Kroger employees in Michigan, as well as employees at meatpacking plants and food processing facilities around the country. Thousands more have tested positive for the virus. Now workers across the country are staying home or quitting altogether, according to interviews with more than a dozen employees, leaving many markets short-staffed and ill-prepared to deal with demand. That’s complicated the scramble led by Walmart, Kroger and Safeway to fill hundreds of thousands of new jobs. Demand for groceries has doubled in recent weeks, employees say, as Americans avoid restaurants and prepare most of their meals at home. Job postings for grocery clerks have jumped 60 percent in the past four weeks, according to Julia Pollak, a labor economist for the site ZipRecruiter. Supermarkets are increasingly hard-pressed to find and keep staff. Workers are walking out, going on strike and circulating petitions aimed at getting companies such as Amazon, Trader Joe’s and delivery service Instacart to take additional measures to protect their health. “The language in job postings has become more desperate,” Pollak said. “Grocery companies are saying there’s an ‘urgent need’ or that they need workers to ‘start immediately.’ It’s becoming more difficult to convince workers to put themselves at risk.” Grocery workers are beginning to die of coronavirus Chains such as Kroger and Safeway have begun providing masks and gloves. Walmart is checking employees’ temperatures before each shift. And countless large and regional chains have installed plexiglass shields at cash registers and signs encouraging social distancing — the best defense against spreading the coronavirus. But employees say more needs to be done. “Grocery workers are risking their safety, often for poverty-level wages, so the rest of us can shelter in place,” said John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University. “The only way the rest of us are able to stay home is because they’re willing to go to work.” Public health experts generally say nurses, doctors, paramedics and other medical workers have the highest risk of exposure to the coronavirus. But grocery workers also come in close contact with large groups of people, often without meaningful protective gear. They are less likely to have paid sick leave or the financial means to take time off if they feel ill. The sector’s relatively low pay — grocery cashiers averaged $11.43 an hour in 2018, Labor Department data show — has also become a bigger part of calculus. Retail workers in their 60s, 70s and 80s say they’re worried about their health — but need the money More than 1,500 supermarket workers throughout the country have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 900,000 grocery employees at chains such as Kroger, Safeway and Giant. Nearly 3,000 members are not working because they are quarantined, hospitalized or awaiting test results, the union said. “The big picture is workers are frightened,” said Marc Perrone, the union’s president. The labor group, he said, is urging states to categorize grocery workers as first responders to give them higher priority for testing and protective equipment such as masks. “We believe in our health-care professionals being first, but we also believe that if we’re going to slow the transmission, that we need to start flattening the curve in those areas where grocery employees are literally coming face-to-face with thousands of people,” Perrone said. Although more than 40 states and the District of Columbia have ordered nonessential businesses to shut their doors in recent weeks, grocery stores are among the few retailers that remain open. Wando Evans had worked at a Chicago-area Walmart for 15 years when managers sent the 51-year-old home March 23 because he was displaying flu-like symptoms. Two days later, he was found dead. Now his brother, Toney Evans, alleges in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed Monday that the world’s largest retailer didn’t provide protective masks and gloves, adequately disinfect the store or keep workers apprised of their colleagues’ illnesses. Another store employee, Phillip Thomas, 48, died four days after Evans. Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the retailer was “heartbroken” by the deaths. “We take this issue seriously and will respond with the court once we have been served with the complaint,” he said in a statement. The company declined to provide a full count of employees who have tested positive for the virus or died of related complications. Some employees at a Whole Foods Market in Virginia say they are afraid to go to work. “It’s like you’re constantly in fight-or-flight mode,” said a worker in her 50s who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her job and health insurance. “It’s been scary, it’s been confusing, and there is a palpable fear among everyone who’s still working. It feels like a war zone.” Retailers furloughed nearly 1 million workers this week. But the industry’s troubles are just beginning. That fear, she says, picked up last week after a store manager called, texted and emailed late one evening to say that someone at the store had tested positive for the coronavirus. A number of cashiers called in sick the next day, leaving long lines that snaked through the aisles. Although there are signs and stickers at her store encouraging customers to stand six feet apart, not everyone does. (Whole Foods is owned by Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) The store recently installed plexiglass dividers at registers and is offering masks to workers who want them. But, the employee said, there are no limits on how many people can be at the store at one time, and the company has made no specific accommodations for its older or more vulnerable workers. A spokeswoman for Whole Foods said the company has had “crowd control protocols” at its stores since March 25. The company is also checking workers’ temperatures and providing gloves and masks before each shift, she said. When the Virginia worker ended her shift that day, she told her manager she wanted time off. She plans to stay home for a couple of weeks, although her children are urging her to quit. Her daughter is helping her update her résumé. “We’re in new territory, and nobody knows what to do,” she said. “But I also need to keep myself safe.” Why many ‘essential’ workers get paid so little, according to experts Shoppers Food stores in Maryland recently began limiting the number of customers who can shop at one time. It is providing disposable gloves and paying employees an extra $2 an hour. But many workers are still scared. The store hasn’t been able to find masks for its employees, they said, and hasn’t provided them with hand sanitizer in days. The chain’s parent company, United Natural Foods, did not respond to a request for comment. “There are things they could have done to better protect us, sooner,” said Amber Stevens, 30, who has been working at the Forestville, Md., store for a dozen years. “It’s a scary feeling to be around so many people and then come home to my family.” Stevens says she’s lucky to still have a job when much of the economy is upside down. At least 17 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since mid-March, and U.S. stock markets have tumbled from the all-time highs set in mid-February. But Stevens worries about passing on the virus to her 9-year-old daughter or 59-year-old mother. Workers say grocers have done little to assuage their fears. Jasmine Kapralova says she has repeatedly asked her managers at a Trader Joe’s in Seattle for guidance on responding to the virus since late February, after dozens of infections had been confirmed locally. She and her colleagues asked to wear masks to work but were told they would be disciplined if they did, she said. “Anytime we tried to talk to management about this outbreak, they made it clear they did not want us speaking about it,” said Kapralova, 39, who has worked at the company for nearly a decade. “They warned us not to freak each other out and cause panic.” She and three colleagues, she said, came down with respiratory infections in early March. Kapralova took three weeks off with pay but says she was warned by her manager not to talk about her symptoms — which included a fever, body aches, a cough and difficulty breathing — on social media. She took an extra week off unpaid but is still sick. Kenya Friend-Daniel, a spokeswoman for Trader Joe’s, confirmed that the company had given Kapralova three weeks of paid leave while she recovers. Managers were concerned, she said, that Kapralova’s social media posts speculating that she had the coronavirus were alarming her colleagues. They asked her to refrain from saying more online because she had not been formally diagnosed, Friend-Daniel said. Although the grocer initially discouraged workers from wearing masks, Friend-Daniel said it is now providing masks and gloves to all employees to keep up with changing guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kapralova has since asked managers to take her off the store’s schedule, Friend-Daniel said. “I shouldn’t go in, but I feel pressured to go because I need the money,” Kapralova said. She and her 12-year-old daughter have been living with relatives since they lost their home in a fire five years ago. “I’m scared to death of dying but also of losing my job and not getting paid.” Elsewhere in Seattle, a longtime Kroger employee says he’s facing a similar decision. At least two colleagues have tested positive for the coronavirus and about 20 more are home sick or awaiting results — although the company has instructed workers not to discuss this with shoppers. Are you a grocery worker or another essential worker? We want to hear from you “It scares the hell out of me,” said the employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears retribution. “We’re terrified, but what choice we do have? We’re college students or we’re parents trying to raise kids. We need the paychecks.” Kroger spokeswoman Kristal Howard said the company is communicating “openly and transparently” with its employees and the public. “Our store teams should confirm when there’s been a diagnosed case, sharing how we’ve worked with the health department and the immediate actions taken to sanitize and clean the store,” she said. The Seattle employee says it never occurred to him that the supermarket job he applied for 13 years ago to support his new wife and infant could one day put his life at risk. He feels vulnerable and scared. “Nobody told us,” he said, “that when the world falls apart, it’s going to fall on our shoulders.” Coronavirus maps: Cases and deaths in the U.S. | Cases and deaths worldwide Vaccines: Tracker by state | Booster shots | Guidance for vaccinated people | Kids | How long does immunity last? | County-level vaccine data What you need to know: Masks FAQ | Delta variant | Other variants | Symptoms guide | Follow all of our coverage and sign up for our free newsletter Got a pandemic question?

        "articles": "President-elect Joe Biden opened his inaugural commemorations Tuesday evening by honoring the 400,000 Americans who have died in the coronavirus pandemic, marking the final hours before his swearing-in with a somber reminder of the struggles facing the nation he will lead Wednesday. Biden, returning to Washington for the first time since winning the election, presided over the first national mourning event amid the pandemic, and it set the tone for an inauguration that will be marked with more solemnity than jubilation. Photos: Scenes during covid memorial ceremonies around the nation Lanterns surrounding the Reflecting Pool next to the Lincoln Memorial shone to represent the dead, and buildings across the nation lit in a united effort to honor those lost. As the sun set with vibrant tangerine hues over a largely desolate, security-conscious downtown, Biden explicitly called on Americans to remember the victims and implicitly signaled the swift changes he would try to bring to the presidency. Four years after President Trump entered office talking about \"American carnage\" and insisting that \"I alone can fix it,\" Biden sought to project an optimism rooted in the possibilities of a country united and working together. \"Between sundown and dusk, let us shine the lights in the darkness,\" Biden said in brief remarks that left the images to speak louder than his words. \"To heal, we must remember. It's hard sometimes to remember, but that's how we heal. It's important to do that as a nation. That's why we're here today.\" Earlier, a Michigan nurse, Lori Marie Key, sang \"Amazing Grace,\" and after Biden spoke, gospel singer Yolanda Adams sang \"Hallelujah.\" As she did, Biden; his wife, Jill; Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris; and her husband, Doug Emhoff, turned to gaze across the darkened pool. In a space that is usually crowded with people for a pre-inaugural concert, the dominant image instead was one of a void framed by light. The ceremony was meant as a demarcation between Biden's presidency and the tenure of Trump, who has mostly ignored the swiftly rising coronavirus caseloads and death toll for months, after insisting during the campaign that the virus would soon disappear. Biden and Harris have cited tackling the virus — by persuading more Americans to use preventive measures and by vaccinating millions vulnerable to it — and the parallel economic collapse as their top priorities when their administration takes power Wednesday. Inauguration planners also organized other iconic buildings — including the Empire State Building in New York and the Space Needle in Seattle — to light up Tuesday night, and invited cities and towns around the country to join in the national moment of tribute. \"For many months, we have grieved by ourselves,\" Harris said on Tuesday night. \"Tonight, we grieve and begin healing together.\" Biden's appearance at the Reflecting Pool came hours after he offered an emotional farewell to his home state, weeping openly several times as he spoke in front of a bank of Delaware flags before boarding a flight to Washington for his swearing-in as president at noon Wednesday. \"I know these are dark times. But there's always light,\" Biden said from the Major Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III National Guard/Reserve Center at New Castle Airport, a venue named after his son, who died of brain cancer in 2015. “You’ve been there for us in the good and the bad and never walked away,” Biden said, after calling out to several friends in the audience. “And I am proud, proud, proud, proud to be a son of Delaware.” As Biden spoke, tears rolled down his face, and he fought for control several times. Paraphrasing an adage from Irish writer James Joyce, Biden said: “Excuse the emotion. But when I die, Delaware will be written on my heart.” Biden said his only regret was that his eldest son, who had been the state’s attorney general and was looking toward a run for governor before his death, was not the one leaving for Washington to be sworn in as president. Biden’s two surviving children and six of his grandchildren accompanied him to Washington. The emotion of the Reflecting Pool commemoration and Biden’s raw goodbye to Delaware matched the tumultuous moment in the country’s history as he prepares to take over as president. More than 20,000 National Guard troops are billeted in the nation’s capital to keep peace during the inauguration. And less than two hours after he spoke, the nation passed the 400,000 mark in covid-19 deaths, even as the coronavirus continues to spread across the nation amid a struggling effort to vaccinate the most vulnerable. As a result, the events leading up to the inauguration have been subdued rather than celebratory and festive. Even before the riot by Trump supporters at the U.S. Capitol two weeks ago, many events associated with a transfer of power had already been scaled back because of the virus. On Inauguration Day, formal balls will be replaced with online events. The National Mall, where inaugural observers would have stood, was void of people, instead turned into an artistic canvas filled with hundreds of lights and tens of thousands of flags. Additional security precautions, including scrapping a train ride Biden planned from Wilmington, Del., to Washington, were made in the days since a deadly mob stormed the Capitol directly after remarks at a rally by Trump. After the memorial service on Tuesday night, Biden and his family went to Blair House, the official presidential guesthouse across the street from the White House. The White House had extended an invitation for Biden to use the property, but Biden's aides over the past week previously had declined to say whether he would stay at the home, as every president-elect has done since Jimmy Carter. Biden, who will be the nation's second Catholic president after John F. Kennedy, is planning to attend Mass at St. Matthew's Cathedral on Wednesday morning. He will be joined by a bipartisan group of congressional leaders. For the first time in recent memory, the incoming and outgoing presidents are not expected to meet on Inauguration Day. Trump plans to depart the White House for Florida in the morning and will be the first outgoing president to boycott his successor's inauguration since Andrew Johnson declined to attend President Ulysses S. Grant's swearing-in in 1869. Vice President Pence, however, said Tuesday that he would attend Biden's inauguration rather than Trump's farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews. Biden's speech on Wednesday is expected to run 20 to 30 minutes and will be \"built around the theme of unity\" and offer \"a forward-looking vision for his presidency while addressing the moment we are living in as a country,\" according to an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private planning. The inauguration will close the most tumultuous transition in modern history, one that was marked by weeks of false accusations by Trump and other Republicans about the election results, which culminated two weeks ago with a pro-Trump mob storming the very steps where Biden will take the oath of office. Biden is planning an immediate burst of executive actions designed to undo a slew of measures carried out by Trump over the past four years. He is planning to immediately reenter the Paris climate accords and repeal the ban on U.S. entry for citizens of some majority-Muslim countries. Biden is expected to sign an order extending nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures and implement a mask-wearing mandate on federal property. Biden’s team has circulated a top-line list of tentative executive orders that lawmakers should expect to be rolled out over each of the next seven days — an early look at policies and messages the new White House expects to press ahead on in its opening days. They include directives in key areas in which Biden had promised action, including fighting the coronavirus, providing economic relief, requiring the federal government to procure American goods, forging racial equality, combating climate change, improving access to health care, overhauling the immigration system and restoring the country’s leadership abroad. The list of Biden’s pending executive orders, confirmed by two people who have seen it and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly, gives a broad overview of what the incoming administration plans to do on its own — without Congress, if necessary — to address the immediate priorities. The president-elect plans to issue administrative actions relating to the coronavirus on Thursday and economic relief on Friday. A “Buy American” action is slated for Monday, and an order addressing issues of racial equity is anticipated on Tuesday. Biden plans to announce actions on climate change on Jan. 27, health care on Jan. 28, immigration on Jan. 29, and on Feb. 1, he is expected to take action on international affairs and national security. Biden also plans to file on Wednesday a sweeping immigration bill, which includes an eight-year pathway to citizenship for immigrants without legal status and an expansion of refugee admissions. At the same time, he plans to press aggressively for a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. Biden’s final few days as a private citizen included a mix of family time and homages to his past and to the crises faced by the country. The president-elect, Jill Biden and other family members packed canned goods and rice into boxes on Monday at Philabundance, Philadelphia's largest hunger-relief program. It was part of a national day of service that kicked the inaugural festivities into high gear, and aides said more than 150 boxes of food were packaged. On Sunday, his granddaughter Naomi posted a photo of Joe Biden with one of his dogs — an empty box and a framed photo propped on the floor in the background, nodding to the packing going on around them. “This is kind of emotional for me,” Biden said in Delaware on Tuesday afternoon, addressing a small audience that included longtime friends and allies. “You’ve been with me my whole career — and through the good times and the bad.” Biden recalled how his parents moved to the state from Pennsylvania under economic duress. He recounted standing on a train platform 12 years earlier, awaiting then-President-elect Barack Obama and speaking to his sons about the changes that had prompted the nation to elect the first Black president. And now, he said, he was headed to Washington to meet up with Harris, who will be the first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president. “I said, ‘Don’t tell me things can’t change. They can. And they do,’ ” Biden said. “That’s America. That’s Delaware. A place of hope and light and limitless possibilities.” Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Note: This is a guest post by Justin Levitt, a professor at the Loyola Law School, Los Angeles and an expert in constitutional law and the law of democracy, with a particular focus on election administration and redistricting. Voter ID laws are back in the news once again, with two new opinions from the Wisconsin Supreme Court late last week dealing with the state's ID requirement, which would allow people to vote only if they provide certain forms of government-issued ID. The Court made some minor changes to the law but otherwise upheld it. However, the ID requirement is still on hold pending a federal lawsuit. Part of this litigation — and any rational debate about the issue generally — hinges on two things: costs and benefits. The costs of these sorts of laws vary, because the laws themselves differ from state to state (some are far more burdensome than others). The ostensible benefits, though, are all the same. And in addressing these purported benefits, the Wisconsin Supreme Court blew it. Twice. First, the court cited the idea that ID laws could enhance public confidence--that is, in theory, the laws might make us feel better about elections in that they might provide some security theater. It turns out, though, that this effect is hard to spot. People in states with more restrictive ID laws don’t generally feel better about their elections than people in more permissive states. People who think elections are being stolen, and people who think they’re not, each hold on to that opinion no matter what the governing ID rules in their area. The factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair? Whether their preferred candidates win. Here’s the completely legal way to ‘rig’ an election Second, the court said that ID laws can help stop fraud. It then cited an example of recent fraud … that ID laws aren’t designed to stop. Specifically, it mentioned a case in which a supporter of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was charged with 13 counts of election fraud, including \"registering to vote in more than one place, voting where he didn't live, voting more than once in the same election, and providing false information to election officials,\" according to an account by Talking Points Memo. Wisconsin's ID law would not likely have prevented any of the alleged violations. This sort of misdirection is pretty common, actually. Election fraud happens. But ID laws are not aimed at the fraud you’ll actually hear about. Most current ID laws (Wisconsin is a rare exception) aren’t designed to stop fraud with absentee ballots (indeed, laws requiring ID at the polls push more people into the absentee system, where there are plenty of real dangers). Or vote buying. Or coercion. Or fake registration forms. Or voting from the wrong address. Or ballot box stuffing by officials in on the scam. In the 243-page document that Mississippi State Sen. Chris McDaniel filed on Monday with evidence of allegedly illegal votes in the Mississippi Republican primary, there were no allegations of the kind of fraud that ID can stop. Instead, requirements to show ID at the polls are designed for pretty much one thing: people showing up at the polls pretending to be somebody else in order to each cast one incremental fake ballot. This is a slow, clunky way to steal an election. Which is why it rarely happens. I’ve been tracking allegations of fraud for years now, including the fraud ID laws are designed to stop. In 2008, when the Supreme Court weighed in on voter ID, I looked at every single allegation put before the Court. And since then, I’ve been following reports wherever they crop up. New evidence that voter ID laws 'skew democracy' in favor of white Republicans To be clear, I’m not just talking about prosecutions. I track any specific, credible allegation that someone may have pretended to be someone else at the polls, in any way that an ID law could fix. So far, I’ve found about 31 different incidents (some of which involve multiple ballots) since 2000, anywhere in the country. If you want to check my work, you can read a comprehensive list of the incidents below. To put this in perspective, the 31 incidents below come in the context of general, primary, special, and municipal elections from 2000 through 2014. In general and primary elections alone, more than 1 billion ballots were cast in that period. Some of these 31 incidents have been thoroughly investigated (including some prosecutions). But many have not. Based on how other claims have turned out, I’d bet that some of the 31 will end up debunked: a problem with matching people from one big computer list to another, or a data entry error, or confusion between two different people with the same name, or someone signing in on the wrong line of a pollbook. In just four states that have held just a few elections under the harshest ID laws, more than 3,000 votes (in general elections alone) have reportedly been affirmatively rejected for lack of ID. (That doesn’t include voters without ID who didn’t show up, or recordkeeping mistakes by officials.) Some of those 3,000 may have been fraudulent ballots. But how many legitimate voters have already been turned away? Correction: Justin Levitt is a professor with Loyola Law School, Los Angeles; not the Loyola University Law School. Note: tracking the allegations — even those that may end up disproven — can help calibrate an upper bound for the actual existing fraud that ID laws would stop. I am a researcher, and so I am interested in a thorough list: if you have credible information about a specific individual whose vote was stolen by an impersonator at the polls, please tell me. Specific and credible means just that. Not — please — examples like this. And if you have information about an incident below that indicates that it was error rather than fraud, please tell me that as well. (Note: these allegations do not include other forms of fraud not prevented by a requirement to show ID at the polls, including absentee ballot fraud, vote buying, vote coercion, fraud in the tallying process, voter registration fraud, double voting, voting by nonresidents, voting by noncitizens, voting by persons disenfranchised by conviction, or fraud in the petitioning process.)

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Hillary Clinton’s campaign just released an ad advocating action on guns, and it seems clear that she’s going to continue talking about this issue. In fact, she could be the first Democratic nominee in a long while to treat the issue of guns without fear, and it shows that she has figured out a couple of key things about it that Democrats haven’t realized before. One might see Clinton’s continued discussion of the gun issue (and the agenda on guns she released a month ago) as aimed primarily at Bernie Sanders, whose record on the issue is a mixed one. But from the beginning, Clinton has been simultaneously running a primary and general election campaign, knowing that anything she says now could be used against her later. Clinton employs a small army of pollsters, and you can be sure that they have thoroughly tested this issue in the context of both the primaries and a potential general election to determine what might be a good or bad idea for her to advocate. It isn’t as though Clinton desperately needs the gun issue in order to become the Democratic nominee. At most, it might make a marginal difference here or there. So why risk incurring the wrath of gun advocates? That’s the first thing Clinton seems to have realized: the National Rifle Association and their allies will come after her no matter what. It doesn’t matter if she talks about guns, or doesn’t talk about guns. It doesn’t matter if she advocates specific restrictions, or doesn’t advocate specific restrictions. It doesn’t matter if she goes hunting a couple of weeks before election day, like John Kerry did. The NRA will scream “She’s coming for your guns!”, just like they did with Barack Obama, and Kerry, and Al Gore, and Bill Clinton. Keeping gun owners in a constant state of fear is essential to maintaining their membership and keeping sales strong for the gun manufacturers who are the NRA’s partners, and they’ll do it no matter who the Democratic nominee is and what he or she says. The second thing Clinton seems to have realized is even more important: the gun issue can actually benefit the Democratic presidential nominee. You’ll notice that the only policy position Clinton takes in the ad is, “we need to close the loopholes and support universal background checks.” Universal background checks are supported by around 90 percent of Americans, including strong majorities of gun owners, Republicans, and even NRA members — in other words, pretty much everyone except the NRA itself. While some of the other things she advocates might not be quite as popular, universal background checks is always going to be the first thing out of her mouth when this issue comes up. The other thing that’s significant about Clinton’s rhetoric is that when she talks about this issue, she usually mentions the NRA by name. There’s a growing understanding that for all its ability to quash gun legislation in Congress, when we’re talking about elections, the NRA is not anything like the potent force it claims to be. Its record in helping its favored candidates get elected in tight races is actually pretty weak; most of the time the organization just tries to claim credit whenever Republicans have a strong year, but becomes oddly silent when Democrats win big. When you mention that, someone is likely to retort, “But didn’t Al Gore lose his home state because of guns, and doesn’t that prove Democrats shouldn’t touch this issue?” This is a myth that’s been circulating for years, encouraged by gun advocates and spread by timorous Democrats. But it’s not true. Al Gore didn’t lose Tennessee because of the gun issue, he lost Tennessee because he was a Democrat. The state had been trending Republican for years, and continued to do so afterward (Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama there by 20 points in 2012). There is precisely zero evidence that the gun issue hurt Gore in Tennessee, and what evidence there is suggests that his position on guns helped him win other states with large urban and suburban populations like Pennsylvania and Michigan (I discussed that election, and the concomitant myth that the NRA won Congress for Republicans in 1994, at greater length in this article). Conservative groups are calling Clinton a hypocrite for her current position because in 2008 she spent more time talking about respecting the rights of gun owners than about restricting gun proliferation. While it may not rise to the level of hypocrisy (she still mentions that there are lots of responsible gun owners), her emphasis certainly has changed. That tells us that while a Democrat might still want to approach the issue with some degree of care, she can do it without the terror that gripped Democrats for so long.

        "articles": "It’s not clear to me that folks are sufficiently appreciating the magnitude and the great importance of the surge in early voting that we’re now seeing. It may end up transforming our politics to a far greater extent than any of us can yet imagine. The numbers are simply staggering. According to The Post’s latest tally, more than 70 million people have voted early. Incredibly, that’s more than 50 percent of the total number of people who voted in the 2016 election. The obvious causes of this are President Trump — who activates voters on both sides like nothing else — and the coronavirus. Much of it is driven by the fact that voting-by-mail is easier than ever in numerous states, including more states that mail absentee-ballot applications directly to eligible voters. Many people who hoped to avoid voting in person during the pandemic are using that option. With campaigns and parties aggressively prodding them to send in ballots early, that’s happening everywhere. The result is that nearly 50 million of those early votes constitute returned mail ballots, according to the U.S. Elections Project. But in-person early voting is also surging, with over 20 million Americans already doing it. The total number of early votes in the battleground states has already topped 33 million. This is already having a transformative impact on our politics. For one thing, it’s bringing us closer to realizing the holy grail of voting advocates and campaigns alike: bringing new voters and people who vote sporadically into the electorate. Indeed, according to a Post compilation of data from 30 states, 1 in 5 of the voters who have voted early so far didn’t vote in their state in the previous election. “It’s an entirely different electorate,” Tom Bonier, the CEO of the data firm TargetSmart, told me. Why is the surge in early voting leading to such high levels of engagement from low-propensity voters? Bonier says the act of making voting more accessible — most notably this cycle by relaxing barriers to voting by mail — results in more people voting, because those sporadic voters are the ones who previously faced more hurdles to participation rooted in socioeconomic factors. “Groups that tend to have more hurdles to participating will see the biggest increases,” Bonier told me. “It’s a radical reshuffling of how people are able to vote. That’s the biggest change.” There also may be a self-reinforcing series of factors at play here. Democratic operatives say the higher numbers of early voters is freeing up resources that can be more focused on targeting a smaller remaining pool of sporadic voters. “We’ve never had an election like this,” Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg told me. “It’s changing the way we do voter contact. When more people vote early, it allows campaigns to target more low-propensity voters that might not otherwise have been targeted.\" “This will almost certainly mean that turnout in this election will be at the upper end of what’s possible,” Rosenberg continued. One key way that operatives try to boost turnout is by getting neighborhood organizers to subject would-be voters to peer pressure. In this case, all the early voting might in some cases be producing its own self-reinforcing peer pressure, as CNN’s Dana Bash and Bridget Nolan illustrated in a recent report on young people voting early. “We know that peer pressure is one of the most powerful motivators for getting folks to vote,” Rosenberg told me. “It’s as if the entire country is under pressure now from other Americans to vote, and a voting virtuous cycle is kicking in.\" Meanwhile, all the early voting is creating a wealth of new information about who is voting in this particular election that campaigns are using to inform strategic decisions in the closing days. Joe Biden’s decision to campaign in Georgia, for instance, is almost certainly due in part to the campaign’s interpretation of the meaning of the surge in African American early voting in the state. “If you’re the Biden campaign, you look at this and say, ‘That’s a sign that our folks are very engaged. We believe this to be in play,'\" Bonier told me. It’s hard to know what sort of long-term impact this will all have. But it’s already proving transformative on many levels, and hopefully it will continue doing so for many cycles to come. Read more: Greg Sargent: Why is Trump trailing?

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old THE MORNING PLUM: Let’s be clear on what’s happening in our politics right now. President Trump and his media allies are currently creating a vast, multi-tentacled, largely-fictional alternate media reality that casts large swaths of our government as irredeemably corrupt — with the explicitly declared purpose of laying the rationale for Trump to pardon his close associates or shut down the Russia probe, should he deem either necessary. We often hear that Trump and his allies are trying to “distract” from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s intensifying investigation. That’s true, but this characterization inadequately casts this in terms ordinarily applied to conventional politics. Instead, Trump’s trafficking in this stuff should be seen as another sign of his fundamental unfitness to serve as president. Similar efforts by his media allies should be labeled as a deliberate effort to goad Trump into sliding into full-blown authoritarianism, and to provide the air cover for him if he does do so. The Associated Press reports that people who have spoken to Trump say that he has recently revisited the idea of trying to remove Mueller, now that Mueller appears to be digging into Trump’s finances. Meanwhile, CNN reports that former Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon is privately urging Trump to try to get Republicans to defund Mueller’s probe. Monday night, Sean Hannity delivered perhaps the most perfect expression yet of efforts to create the rationale for such moves. Hannity dismissed the news of major allegations against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the cooperation of adviser George Papadopoulos as big nothingburgers. He also hit all the high points of the new Trump/media campaign, points that Trump himself and the White House have made repeatedly in public statements. Those include reviving the made-up scandal that Hillary Clinton approved a deal for a Russian nuclear agency to gain access to U.S. uranium extraction rights in exchange for kickbacks, and the absurdly exaggerated claim that the Clinton campaign, having paid through various intermediaries for research that ultimately led to the “Steele Dossier,” actually colluded with Russia to interfere in the election. These have been extensively fact checked and debunked. In an important new piece, Post fact checker Glenn Kessler blows another big hole in one of this campaign’s key story lines. Kessler notes that multiple Trump media allies are repeating the claim that Clinton gave away “20 percent” of our uranium capacity to Russia. And he shows that, for various technical reasons, this figure is itself absurdly inflated, and the description of this as a Clinton giveaway has no relation to reality. But the real point of Hannity’s presentation came when he flatly accused Mueller of trying to “change the narrative to distract from the real Russia collusion and massive cover-ups.” Hannity added that Mueller “is clearly complicit in the Uranium One scandal.” This is a reference to the fact that Mueller headed the FBI when the uranium deal happened. Reports that the FBI was investigating a Russian energy official’s efforts to corrupt a U.S. company at the time have led to GOP questions about why the Obama administration green-lighted the deal anyway. But this is also absurd, as Kessler explains, since the deal went through an extensive multi-agency process and no evidence has been presented that this process improperly skirted any FBI probe. Regardless, Hannity concluded: “We are at a real crisis point in America tonight.” Trump has tweeted in support of many of these allegations. And as Jonathan Chait details, other Trump media allies have explicitly cited these and other similar story-lines (Mueller’s investigators are Dem donors!) in support of the notion that Mueller should resign or that Trump should close down the Russia probe. We don’t know if Trump will go full authoritarian or not. But as Brian Beutler says, the mere fact that congressional Republicans are not flashing a bright warning sign itself suggests that we cannot count on any procedural response meeting it, if it does come to that. The continued media treatment of efforts to lay the groundwork for such an eventuality as mere efforts to “distract” from Mueller suggests another guardrail is inadequate as well. Indeed, it’s important to reckon with the scope of what Trump and his allies are alleging. The idea is that Mueller — who was originally appointed to head the FBI by George W. Bush, and who became special counsel because of Trump’s own firing of his FBI director over the Russia probe — originally participated in a hallucinatory conspiracy to cover up Clinton collusion with Russia. Now Mueller is using the current investigation to distract from it. In this alternate universe, all of that is the crisis (Hannity’s word) we face, and the only way to address it is for Trump to close all of it down. Dem strategist Simon Rosenberg is right to point out that Trump’s trafficking in all of this — his endorsement of the idea of preposterous levels of corruption and conspiracy theories unfurling at many levels throughout the government — itself raises questions about Trump’s fitness to serve. We need to confront the insanity and depravity of all this forthrightly, and convey it accurately. * ‘SEETHING’ TRUMP HAD TO BE TALKED DOWN ON MUELLER: CNN reports that after the indictments came down, aides “urgently” advised Trump not to “lash out” at Robert S. Mueller III. And: Also, CNN reports that George Papadopoulos’s cooperation has surprised the White House and is “stirring even more unease among Trump’s allies.” Which gives the lie to all the bravado we’re seeing. * TRUMP FRETS THAT MUELLER IS LOOKING AT HIS BUSINESS DEALINGS: The Associated Press adds more on Trump’s state of mind: You’d think Republicans might want to do something about this before it’s too late. But you would be wrong: * REPUBLICANS NOT FEELING URGENCY ABOUT MUELLER: The Post reports that GOP leaders “avoided the substance of the charges Mueller” filed. Meanwhile: Why act now to warn Trump against precipitating a full-blown constitutional crisis, when we can deal with it if and when it happens? * THE REAL JOHN KELLY SHOWS HIMSELF: In an interview with Laura Ingraham, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly refused to apologize for lying about the African American congresswoman who spoke up on behalf of the widow of a slain soldier. He also remarked that “the lack of ability to compromise led to the Civil War.” What’s particularly galling about this is that it comes after Kelly lectured us about the disappearance of basic decency and traditional values. Yet here he contemptuously sneers lies about Rep. Frederica Wilson, and when caught out, refuses to take responsibility for it. His reading of history is highly questionable, too. * MUELLER IS RUNNING A VERY AGGRESSIVE INVESTIGATION: The New York Times reports this interesting detail, leading up to the indictments of Paul Manafort and business associate Rick Gates: Some of this might be intended as an effort to send a message to others who fear getting swept up in the probe that they should cooperate with it. * MANAFORT’S MONEY LAUNDERING, MAPPED OUT: The Times also has a pretty cool visual depiction of the money laundering laid out in the indictment, as well as what it was spent on. Summary: The sheer brazenness of this scheme continues to surprise, as does its acquisitiveness: More than $12 million was spent on personal goods and more than $6 million went to real estate. * IS A LOUSY TAX CUT REALLY WORTH ALL THIS? Paul Krugman notes that those who will benefit from Trump/GOP tax cuts already are so rich that they won’t really notice their impact, and asks whether it’s really worth the destruction that Trump has unleashed: But wait, what about the explosion of economic growth and sudden corporate willingness to hand over newly untaxed profits to workers that these tax cuts will surely unleash?

        "articles": "There was a time when Bernie Sanders, the stiff, white senator from Vermont, seemed painfully out of place in black churches. But not now at the end of the long primary trail, and not in Oakland, Calif., at the Allen Temple Baptist Church. Summoning congregants last week in a historic East Oakland sanctuary that helped give rise to the civil rights movement and the Black Panther Party, he spoke passionately about the plight of many blacks: Too many children are raised in poverty, too many youths can’t afford to go to college and can’t find jobs, too many adults are locked in jails. The system is rigged against them, and he vowed to change it. The audience rose in applause and affirmation. There were hurrahs and smiles and shouts of “Amen!” At last, Sanders had convinced African Americans that he understood their story — and, at last, they seemed to understand his. Only it was too late. By the time Sanders showed up in Oakland, he had effectively lost his chance to be president. Even an unexpectedly lopsided win in Tuesday’s California primary would almost certainly not be enough to stop front-runner Hillary Clinton from clinching the Democratic nomination. For all that Sanders has achieved — turning a protest movement into a viable run, gaining mainstream acceptance for his democratic socialist views, pioneering a new way to fund campaigns and pushing his adopted Democratic Party to the left on trade, Wall Street and other issues — his campaign for president is also a story of might-have-beens. Since March 15, roughly the midway point in the primary season, Sanders has fought Clinton to a draw — he has won about as many contests and almost the same number of pledged delegates as Clinton. A comeback victory in California, a state with demographics that have favored Clinton elsewhere, would be ­another triumphant second-half win that would make it even harder for Sanders to accept defeat. “Bernie didn’t grow up thinking he was going to be president,” said former Vermont governor Howard Dean, a Clinton supporter. “To come as close as he has, it’s damn hard to let go.” According to interviews with the candidate, his advisers, allies and other Democrats, Sanders fell short because of missed opportunities, a failure to connect with key constituencies and stubborn strategy decisions. Perhaps the campaign’s biggest mistake was not realizing early on that Sanders could win. That led to a slow start, both in building the infrastructure needed to run a national campaign and in Sanders’s own presence among voters who knew little about him. “I don’t think anybody had figured out how to win when we got in,” said senior strategist Tad Devine. “It was ‘How do we become credible?’ ” As it became clear that Sanders was gaining credibility, though, he struggled to connect with black and Latino voters, as well as with older Democrats, groups that carried Clinton’s candidacy. Sanders repeatedly clashed with another vital constituency — the party leaders whose votes as superdelegates he would ultimately need to pry the nomination away from Clinton. Sanders also overestimated the power of his economic message and, adamant that he run the kind of positive campaign that had been his trademark in Vermont, initially underestimated the imperative to draw sharp contrasts with Clinton. “His economic message has been pretty powerful — so powerful that you feel elements in what Hillary is saying now,” said David Axelrod, chief strategist on President Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. But, he said, “there’s a story about this old blues player, Papa John Creach. One guy says, ‘He has only one riff,’ and his friend goes, ‘But it’s a great riff.’ “Bernie is Papa John Creach,” Axelrod continued. “He’s got a great riff but doesn’t have a lot of variety.” Late last year, as part of his effort to establish himself among black voters, Sanders led the media on a walking tour of the impoverished Baltimore neighborhood of Freddie Gray, the black man whose death following an incident with police had sparked rioting in the city. Sanders encountered boarded-up rowhouses, corner convenience stores with bars on the windows and trash strewn about the streets. He was trying to show that he gets it, but his comments instead underscored the different world he and his wife, Jane, inhabit in Vermont, a rural state that is 95 percent white. Describing the scene before him as a “Third World country,” Sanders said that “a few blocks away from where we live, there’s a very nice grocery store, a supermarket. We buy good-quality food, produce, at a reasonable price. You don’t have that here.” Sanders had a personal connection he could have shared with black voters — he attended the March on Washington in 1963 and got arrested while protesting school segregation in Chicago — but he was initially reluctant to open up about it. Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who campaigned for Sanders across the country, said she pleaded with Sanders to talk more about his own history in the civil rights movement. “Tell your story, and weave it into your platform,” Turner said she told him. But she said her advice was not always heeded: “He doesn’t like talking about himself.” The first big test of Sanders’s appeal to African Americans came in February in South Carolina. He hired staff members to coordinate African American outreach. He aired ads on black radio stations. He deployed an eclectic group of high-profile validators, including former NAACP head Benjamin Jealous, scholar Cornel West, rapper Killer Mike and actor Danny Glover. But nothing seemed to work — and Sanders wasn’t connecting on his own. “Bless his heart, I don’t think he has been around people of color a lot,” said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a prominent black state senator in South Carolina who stayed neutral in the primary. “I saw him speak, and he didn’t slow down. He didn’t read his audience — body language, faces, a certain cadence. No slowing down to receive or acknowledge affirmation or an ‘Amen’ here or there. He was brusque. He didn’t appear to feel comfortable — and it showed.” Justin T. Bamberg, among a half-dozen black state legislators who supported Sanders in South Carolina, said, “It was an uphill battle from the beginning,” made worse by the fact that Sanders did not do enough retail politicking. “That’s just how things are down here,” Bamberg said. “It makes it seem like you care enough to visit, and that can go a long way.” Then there was Sanders’s message. His diagnosis for what ails the country is essentially a one-size-fits-all overarching sense of economic injustice. But many Democrats, particularly African Americans, say race also factors heavily into the economic plight of blacks. “How deeply the rules of the game are slanted against people of color — that was an element that he had to figure out how to do more with,” said Dean, a former Democratic National Committee chairman. “His core is fighting for working-class people, a classic class analysis. But race is just as big a deal in this country.” Sanders got crushed in South Carolina, losing 73 percent to 26 percent. The margin would be similar in a string of Southern primaries that quickly followed, cresting with a 66-point loss in Mississippi in early March. Sanders was never likely to win in the South against the Clintons and their long history with African American voters, but it was those enormous margins that allowed the former secretary of state to build an insurmountable delegate lead. In the 15 states that have already voted and that have a larger proportion of African Americans than the United States as a whole — most of them in the South — Clinton has won 353 more pledged delegates than Sanders. In the other 34 contests, Sanders had won 78 more pledged delegates than Clinton, as of Saturday. “Clearly, we did very poorly in the South,” Sanders said in an interview. “There’s no ifs, ands or buts about that.” He said that his appeal to African Americans has improved as the campaign has continued, but he attributed that to voters’ being more familiar with him rather than anything he has done differently. Turner, the former Ohio state senator, said his performance among fellow African Americans “keeps me up at night.” She said that Sanders’s economic and criminal-justice proposals clearly would benefit African Americans but that Sanders needed more time to become a known commodity. “He’s coming into his own now,” she said, “but it’s June.” Part of Sanders’s strategy to win heavily African American states was to win the three that came before them: Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. The Sanders team reasoned that they had a shot in all three and that running the table would provide momentum and buzz and, in the words of Devine, would “open the door” in the South. Nonetheless, Sanders did not go all out for months after his April 2015 announcement. Aides said he felt strongly about maintaining his workload in the Senate, so trips to Iowa, New Hampshire and other states were mostly confined to long weekends. At first, Sanders also eschewed retail politics. Sometimes after campaign rallies, Sanders made a beeline to his car rather than sticking around to greet voters one on one or posing for selfies. By contrast, Clinton sprinkled roundtable discussions and meet-and-greet visits to coffee shops throughout her itineraries. Sanders sought to create momentum by drawing huge crowds to rallies, many in liberal cities that were far afield from the early voting states. His aides argued that the news coverage justified the strategy for such an unknown candidate, but others said it cost him where the first votes would be cast. “I think that the gigantic rallies were seductive to the Sanders campaign, but they don’t translate in Iowa as well as the conference-table discussions,” said Jerry Crawford, a veteran Iowa Democrat who chaired Clinton’s state campaign. Nonetheless, by December, a little over a month before the Iowa caucuses, the Sanders team started to sense that they could win the kickoff contest, Devine said. The Clinton campaign soon sensed it, too. Specifically, it saw one number in Ann Selzer’s poll for the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics that spooked them. Two weeks before the caucuses, 43 percent of probable caucus-going Democrats described themselves as socialists. “That meant that all Bernie had to do to win the Iowa caucuses, literally, was get 7 percent of everyone else who didn’t call themselves a socialist,” Crawford said. “To me, it’s still a miracle that he didn’t.” When the Sanders campaign aired an ad in which Sanders says, “It’s called a rigged economy, and this is how it works,” Clinton allies sensed more trouble. Jeff Link, who ran Obama’s campaigns in Iowa, said he called Clinton’s state director, Matt Paul, and said, “Dude, you’ve got a problem.” In the end, Clinton eked out a victory by 0.3 percent of the vote. It was an unexpectedly strong showing for Sanders, but it wasn’t enough to fundamentally alter the Democratic race or overcome the near nonstop media focus on Donald Trump and the Republican nomination battle. Clinton’s victory had been built precinct by precinct over nine months. By caucus day, Sanders had hired his own army of staff and organized in all 99 counties, but it was too late to catch up. “There was a path for Senator Sanders to win . . . but it would have needed near-perfect execution and a worse candidate than Hillary Clinton,” said R.T. Rybak, vice chairman of the DNC and a former Minneapolis mayor. Inside the Sanders campaign, a common lament was that there were not enough days on the calendar. Sanders’s wife, Jane, a political strategist in her own right, said as much as she talked with reporters aboard her husband’s campaign plane after the first string of states. “I would have like to have had more opportunity to just camp out down in South Carolina, so they could know him,” she said. “That wasn’t an option. . . . We needed to be in Iowa, we needed to be in New Hampshire, we needed to be in Nevada, then we needed to be in South Carolina. It’s just timing. Time was the enemy for this part.” One of the biggest adjustments Sanders made between his early losses and later wins was to start attacking Clinton with gusto. What had started as an early point of pride for Sanders, that he did not go after Clinton, eventually gave way to an aggressive effort to contrast their positions, question Clinton’s judgment and knock her for accepting six-figure speaking fees from Wall Street firms and for refusing to release transcripts of those remarks. Some Sanders allies say adopting the tougher posture sooner could have made a real difference — putting Clinton on her heels and bringing to fore more of the vulnerabilities that are now weighing down her favorability. “Running for office is about attention,” Turner said. “It doesn’t have to be going for someone’s jugular, but you need to draw the contrasts. I wish he had started off that way.” Burt Cohen, a former New Hampshire state senator who served on Sanders’s steering committee there, said Sanders could have been more aggressive about highlighting Clinton’s ties to the moderate wing of the party in a year when base voters wanted a progressive nominee. “But he is who he is,” Cohen said of Sanders. “He’s a gentleman, and he was hesitant to go after Hillary.” Squaring off for the first Democratic debate in October, Sanders famously declared that people were “sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,” a reference to the drumbeat of news coverage about Clinton’s use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state. The remark was widely lauded and seen as a sign of Sanders’s authenticity, but Turner said that moment also “set the stage in some people’s minds that he wasn’t a fighter.” Devine said “the initial calculation was from him, that we shouldn’t talk a lot about the peripheral issues having to do with the Clintons.” That meant the email controversy and questions about the Clinton Foundation were largely off-limits. The Sanders team also calculated that, had he attacked her early, he would have invited an equally aggressive posture from Clinton and her allies, including a well-funded super PAC. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver disputed the suggestion that Sanders should have gone negative on Clinton sooner. “You have to introduce yourself to voters for them to understand who you are and what you stand for,” he said. “You can’t start a campaign by drawing contrasts.” The remaining question for Sanders is how he plans to end his campaign. Sanders insists that he will not drop out Tuesday when California and five other states vote, even if a combination of superdelegates and the pledged makes clear that Clinton has claimed the nomination. The final Democratic contest is the following Tuesday in the District of Columbia. And he is vowing to press ahead to the Democratic National Convention in July in Philadelphia. Sanders hopes to persuade enough of the 718 superdelegates — elected officials and other party elites not bound by the outcome of the contests in their states — to switch their votes. His argument: Polls show him performing better against Trump in head-to-head matchups than Clinton. It is painfully ironic for Sanders that his fate will be determined by the Democratic establishment with which he has zealously sparred throughout his congressional career. Axelrod recalled attending Senate Democratic caucus meetings where Sanders, an independent who caucused with the Democrats, was a loner. “Bernie would always be off by himself,” Axelrod said. “He was with them and not of them. In certain ways, that’s worked for him here. Having been in Congress for 25 years, he can credibly claim not to be part of the establishment. But that can be costly when you have to count on the establishment to buoy your candidacy.” As of this weekend, 547 superdelegates had publicly announced support for Clinton, while Sanders could claim the backing of only 46. Sanders’s effort is considered a long shot if not an impossibility by most political observers, but Sanders said getting even this far was once seen as equally implausible. “When we started the campaign, people didn’t know Bernie Sanders or what our agenda was,” said Sanders, who originally budgeted $30 million to $50 million but so far has raised and spent more than $200 million. “This campaign has done what many people thought was impossible.” Ralph Nader, a former Green Party presidential candidate who, like Sanders, has operated as a leftist outside the two-party system, said the normalizing of socialism has been one of Sanders’s biggest achievements. “Socialism used to be a no-no word,” Nader said. “He has brought the word into the mainstream and made class distinctions central to his campaign. He’s ended the taboo.” As Sanders traveled in his Secret Service motorcade between campaign stops in California, he said he is not looking back. “My focus is today,” he said, “and not worrying about what I could have done six months ago.” Wagner and Costa reported from Washington; Rucker, from Oakland, Calif.

        "articles": "ROCHESTER, N.H. — As Scott Walker traveled through New Hampshire’s 10 counties this weekend on a rented Harley-Davidson Road King, the 2016 presidential candidate kept getting questions like these: Are you worried? Are you going to be okay? What about Donald Trump? Walker has plummeted in early polls, falling from being one of the front-runners to registering as yet another Republican hopeful with single-digit support far behind Trump. His decline has been especially pronounced here in New Hampshire, home to the first-in-the-nation primary, where his polling averages resemble a ski slope — dropping from a 20 percent peak in April to just 5 percent now. During his two-day tour here pegged to Labor Day, Walker sought to show off his average-guy side — wearing a T-shirt and jeans while riding a motorcycle — and to tout his success in weakening unions in Wisconsin, where he is governor. But he instead spent a good chunk of the weekend addressing his viability as a candidate. He talked about former front-runners who never became president. He compared competing in the presidential race to running a half-mile track event in high school, sticking with the pack until the finish line is close. He also likened his strategy to skeet shooting, aiming the gun at the spot in the sky where the clay pigeon is headed, not where it already is. And he said the national media has been focused on the wrong issues, glorifying the wrong candidates and twisting his words. “Just like we saw in this ride today — we went up and down hills and around mountains and around corners — in the end, there are going to be ups and downs in a campaign,” Walker said at the Pink Cadillac diner here in Rochester on Monday afternoon. Later, he told a supporter inside: “We just have to stay constant, stay who you are.” Staying constant, however, has been one of his biggest challenges. On key issues of the day — from calls to end birthright citizenship to the jailing of a Kentucky county official who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses — Walker has struggled more than other candidates to clearly explain where he stands. On several issues, he has attempted to not take a side — including when asked this week what he would do to directly address the crisis facing Europe as hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria and other war-torn countries search for a safe place to live. Walker said the United States must fight the Islamic State, which he says is at the root of the crisis, but he wouldn’t take a stance beyond that. “I’m not president today, and I can’t be president today,” Walker said in Rochester on Monday. “Everybody wants to talk about hypotheticals; there is no such thing as a hypothetical.” “He was my number one; I was very excited when he entered the race,” said Nancy Barrett, 46, a New Hampshire mother of two who met Walker over a homestyle breakfast in Twin Mountain on Monday. “But he’s been losing me a little when some of the other candidates have come out a lot stronger on illegal immigration and are challenging some of the establishment policies.” Barrett’s new No. 1 candidate: Trump. Walker’s problems followed him to New Hampshire. He was greeted by a handful to a couple dozen people at each stop — far fewer than he attracted soon after launching his campaign in mid-July. A few visitors were Democrats looking to grill him on labor issues, nuclear weapons and immigration. At the Salem GOP Labor Day Picnic, Walker chatted about his love of Harleys with three Republicans wearing Trump T-shirts. On Sunday afternoon, a rider in the governor’s pack fell off his bike, not seriously injuring himself but slowing the group down. The sun was setting as Walker pulled into the last stop of the day in Plymouth. It was nearly dark when he began to answer questions from the media. He was obviously tired after a long day. A reporter from Wisconsin asked Walker whether his lack of clear stances on recent issues is hurting him in the polls as voters opt for Trump’s clarity. The governor — who is typically unflappable on the campaign trail — cut the reporter off. “I don’t think the issue is that at all. I think you’re totally misreading,” he said sharply. “You guys in the media might be talking amongst yourselves and thinking that’s it, but that’s not what I hear from voters out there.” He said voters want to hear about his plans to shift power from Washington to the states and grow the economy. “I think what’s hurting anybody in the polls is that the media wants to talk about issues that the public doesn’t care about — or, I shouldn’t say doesn’t care about. The media wants to talk about issues that aren’t at the top of the list of what people want to talk about,” Walker said. “At the last debate, nobody asked those sorts of questions. You guys don’t ask those sorts of questions. But those are the questions people ask us.” Walker’s campaign staff is eager for a standout moment that could catapult him back to the top tier. They want to introduce him to more voters through cable-news appearances, conservative radio spots, interviews with local reporters in key early-voting states and meetings with grass-roots activists. Walker is nearly constantly on the campaign trail. But those efforts come with a risk: He keeps saying things that get him into trouble — like when he was asked late last month whether the United States should build a wall along the 5,525-mile Canadian border, and he responded by calling it a “legitimate” idea. By the time Walker’s campaign made clear more than a day later that he did not actually want to construct such a wall — and that the governor was instead raising concerns about security on the northern border — the notion had already been ingrained in people’s minds. As Walker arrived in Plymouth on Sunday evening, a black Jeep sped by and a man shouted: “Build that wall around Canada, Scott! Build that wall! That’s a great idea!” “It’s terrible what they’re doing to you,” Brenda Cameron of Dover, N.H., told Walker during the Pink Cadillac visit Monday. She blamed fellow conservatives for pinning the crazy idea on him, but he told her it was the media’s fault. “Boy, they made you sound so stupid,” she said. Walker nodded along at the ridiculousness of a northern wall and said: “I’ve never said that, nor would I. . . . When they say things like that, you just have to laugh and roll your eyes.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.",

        "articles": "The Justice Department and the FBI are investigating whether high-profile right-wing figures — including Roger Stone and Alex Jones — may have played a role in the Jan. 6 Capitol breach as part of a broader look into the mind-set of those who committed violence and their apparent paths to radicalization, according to people familiar with the investigation. The investigation into potential ties between key figures in the riot and those who promoted former president Donald Trump’s false assertions that the election was stolen from him does not mean those who may have influenced rioters will face criminal charges, particularly given U.S. case law surrounding incitement and free speech, the people said. Officials at this stage said they are principally seeking to understand what the rioters were thinking — and who may have influenced beliefs — which could be critical to showing their intentions at trial. However, investigators also want to determine whether anyone who influenced them bears enough responsibility to justify potential criminal charges, such as conspiracy or aiding the effort, the officials said. That prospect is still distant and uncertain, they emphasized. Nevertheless, while Trump’s impeachment trial focused on the degree of his culpability for the violence, this facet of the case shows investigators’ ongoing interest in other individuals who never set foot in the Capitol but may have played an outsized role in what happened there through their influence, networks or action. “We are investigating potential ties between those physically involved in the attack on the Capitol and individuals who may have influenced them, such as Roger Stone, Alex Jones and [Stop the Steal organizer] Ali Alexander,” said a U.S. official, who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the pending investigation. Stone is a longtime adviser to Trump, while Jones is a radio and Web-streaming host behind Infowars.com. Both are frequent purveyors of conspiracy theories: Stone wrote a book suggesting Lyndon B. Johnson was behind John F. Kennedy’s assassination; Jones has spread and retracted claims that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a “hoax.” All three amplified and intensified Trump’s incendiary and baseless claims that the 2020 election was illegitimate in the weeks leading up to the riot. But Stone and Alexander have directly credited each other with inspiring and planning the pro-Trump Stop the Steal campaign, with Alexander saying he came up with the idea and helped organize the Jan. 6 rally that drew Trump supporters to Washington. Stone and Jones also promoted the extremist groups Proud Boys and Oath Keepers and had preexisting business or personal ties with members the government has charged with coordinating and planning certain parts of the breach or in connection with violence at an earlier Trump rally, records and documents show. A key task for prosecutors and agents is to sift through the multitude of motives and intentions of the roughly 800 people in the mob that descended upon the Capitol — from those who came as individuals drawn to the idea of derailing Joe Biden’s presidency before it began, to those who allegedly began organizing immediately after the election to show up in Washington in large numbers to use force to try to keep Trump in power. The U.S. official and others familiar with the investigation cautioned that the role of firebrands like Stone and Jones may be important mostly to painting a complete picture of that day’s events, regardless of whether they ultimately rise to the level of conspiracy or other crimes. Stone and Jones helped promote Trump’s false election fraud claims and earlier rallies in Washington and participated in pro-Trump events Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, but each has denied intending anything beyond peaceful protest. Shortly after the riot, Jones said on Infowars that he was invited by the White House on about Jan. 3 to “lead the march” to the Capitol, and that he paid nearly $500,000, mostly donated, to help organize the event on the Ellipse. Jones promoted the event vigorously, called for 1 million marchers and told his viewers on Jan. 1, “Roger Stone spent some substantial time with Trump in Florida just a few days ago, and I’m told big things are afoot and Trump’s got major actions up his sleeve.” A day before the insurrection, Jones urged a pro-Trump crowd at Freedom Plaza in downtown Washington “to resist the globalists” with his refrain, “I don’t know how all this is all going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they’ve got one!” In a Jan. 6 post from near the same spot, he declared “1776” — a term co-opted by Trump fans urging a kind of second revolution against the government. “We’re under attack, and we need to understand this is 21st-century warfare and get on a war footing,” Jones said. On that day, however, Jones said, he followed, not led, the rally crowd as people moved toward the Capitol, and became alarmed by the chaos. “Let’s not fight the police and give the system what they want,” Jones was recorded shouting. His attorney Marc Randazza said the video shows Jones urged calm, adding, “If you wish to know what Alex Jones’ role was [on Jan. 6] you need look no further than the video.” Later Jones is heard saying, “Trump is going to speak over here! Trump is coming!” in what appears to be an attempt to distract and move a crowd away from the building’s embattled west front. Stone has also publicly distanced himself from the violence and criticized it, telling Moscow-funded RT television on Jan. 8 that he was invited to lead a march but “I declined.” He said in the same interview that when he addressed a rally at the Supreme Court on Jan. 5, he intended “peaceful protest” and added, “I have specifically denounced the violence at the Capitol, the intrusion in the Capitol. That’s not how we settle things in America.” In the Jan. 5 speech, Stone characterized the next day’s events as “an epic struggle for the future of this country between dark and light . . . the godly and the godless . . . good and evil.” Stone’s attorney Grant Smith said in a statement, “There is no evidence whatsoever that Roger Stone was involved in any way, or had advance knowledge about the shocking attack that took place at the US Capitol on January 6th. Any implication to the contrary using ‘guilt by association’ is both dishonest and inaccurate.” Alexander, in a since-deleted video on Periscope weeks before the Jan. 6 rally, said he and three hard-line Republican Trump supporters “schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting” to change the minds of those who wouldn’t go against certifying Biden’s win. Alexander did not respond to an emailed request for comment for this story. But in an email to The Washington Post in mid-January, Alexander said he had “remained peaceful” during the riot. “Conflating our legally, peaceful permitted events with the breach of the US Capitol building is defamatory and false,” he said. On Telegram, Alexander has since blamed outside “Capitol agitators” for sabotaging events. In recorded videos and on Infowars, Stone and Jones have lifted the profiles of the Proud Boys, a far-right group with a history of violence, and Oath Keepers — a loose network of self-styled militias — branding them as street-level security forces for right-wing causes and VIPs. The government has charged nine alleged affiliates of the Oath Keepers with conspiracy, and accused an Ohio member of leading up to 30 to 40 others in the break-in. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes has said he gave no direction or signals to members to storm the Capitol. The leader of the Proud Boys has said the group did not plan to interrupt Congress. Stone was recorded on video both at the Supreme Court and at his D.C. hotel on Jan. 5 and 6 with several Oath Keepers members who he has said were providing security. The charged Ohio leader, Jessica Watkins, told a court Saturday that after falling “prey to the false and inflammatory claims” of Trump, his supporters and right-wing media, she was assigned to escort lawmakers and others both days, was given a VIP pass to the Jan. 6 rally, and encountered Secret Service agents that day. Stone in online columns accused news organizations that reported the recordings of engaging in guilt by association and “more ‘Russian-collusion hoax-style’ smears.” Stone wrote that he knew of “no wrongdoing by the Oath Keepers or the Proud Boys” and that if credible information were to emerge revealing a conspiracy, everyone involved should be prosecuted. Already, officials have charged three Proud Boys leaders in connection with the Capitol riot or an earlier pro-Trump rally in Washington — Proud Boys chairman Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, organizer Joe Biggs and Seattle leader Ethan Nordean. The three registered a company together last year, and Tarrio and Biggs also have preexisting personal or business connections to Stone and Jones, respectively, according to records and documents. In proceedings while charged with obstructing Congress, Stone testified that Tarrio was one of a handful of aides he entrusted with his phones and social media accounts, explaining why Stone’s Instagram account had posted an image of the judge’s head next to what appeared to be gunsight crosshairs. Stone was convicted but pardoned by Trump last year. Tarrio, 33, promoted Stone’s legal defense fund, launched an online store selling Stone and Proud Boys gear, and led Latinos for Trump in Florida, which worked with the White House’s political liaison office. During last year’s campaign, Trump famously encouraged the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.” On Dec. 29, Tarrio took to Parler to encourage the Proud Boys to “turn out in record numbers” to the Jan. 6 demonstration, adding in a Jan. 3 Telegram post, “What if we invade it?” Biggs, 37, became an on-air personality for Jones’s online Infowars outlet starting in 2014, covering armed Oath Keepers’ emergence at protests against police brutality at Ferguson, Mo., and ranchers’ violent standoff against U.S. authorities at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. In a Nov. 20 podcast promoted by Jones, Tarrio suggested viewers “kick off this [Biden] presidency with f------ fireworks,” infiltrate his inauguration and “turn [it] into a f------ circus, a sign of resistance, a sign of revolution.” That podcast, which featured Biggs and Nordean, and was first reported by online news site the Daily Dot, was posted to YouTube but has since been removed. The Post has viewed the video. Nordean, 30, who called himself Rufio Panman online, became a Proud Boys spokesman after a video of him punching out a Portland protester in June 2018 went viral and was featured by Jones. Last July, Tarrio, Biggs and Nordean started a Florida business called Warboys LLC, promoting right-wing causes online in the footsteps of Stone and Jones and through Tarrio’s store, the 1776 Shop. Americans must “desensitize” themselves to violence, Nordean said in a Parler-linked video Dec. 31 in which his guest called Proud Boys “soldiers of the right wing” at war. Biggs’s defense attorney Michael Ryan has called the allegations against Biggs “speculative” and said he is not accused of damaging the Capitol. Nordean’s attorney, Assistant Federal Defender Corey Endo of Seattle, has said his client is not accused of violence, and that prosecutors were targeting Proud Boys via “guilt by association.” Endo declined to comment, and Ryan did not respond to requests for comment. Tarrio was not at the Jan. 6 rally and has not been charged with any wrongdoing related to the riot. He was arrested on Jan. 4 and pleaded not guilty to weapons and property destruction charges at a previous pro-Trump protest in the District. Tarrio said he posted “What if we invade it” in reference to recruiting candidates to take over local and national Republican committees, not the Capitol. He said he was in touch with Stone and others about his plans to attend the Jan. 6 rally, but that was all. “There was no plan to go into the Capitol . . . There was no plan to even interrupt Congress.” The Proud Boys have been a major focus of the FBI investigation so far, in part because of their statements in the run-up to the attack, according to people familiar with the investigation. At least 18 Proud Boys or associates also have been charged, including several who, according to court documents, allegedly appeared to move in an organized fashion at the head of crowds storming police, forcing entry. Some also appeared to be wearing or using earpieces and two-way walkie-talkie-style communication devices, prosecutors and the FBI said. The group’s actions pose another critical question for prosecutors and FBI agents: how individual rioters grew “radicalized” to allegedly commit crimes that meet the textbook definition of domestic terrorism, and whether any criminal culpability extends beyond the rioters to anyone who may have worked with them. Prosecutors and the FBI have cast a wide net for evidence of radicalization that led to violent criminal conduct at the Capitol, obtaining more than 500 search warrants and grand jury subpoenas and opening case files on more than 400 potential suspects as of Jan. 26. A Jan. 21 search warrant for the home and electronic devices of a Maryland man charged with assaulting police on Jan. 6 sought information relating to “radicalization against the U.S. Congress, the 2020 presidential election, the Jan. 6 certification . . . and the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential Inauguration.” The warrant also sought information regarding animosity toward U.S. officials or law enforcement; interest in the security and layout of federal buildings; and others who “collaborated, conspired or assisted [--] knowingly or unknowingly,” in the assault, or who communicated about related matters. Justice Department spokesmen referred questions to the FBI, which declined to comment. First Amendment litigator Ken White said the legal hurdle for charging incitement rises the further removed in time and distance the speaker is from any lawless activity. “It’s incredibly hard under current law to say that someone like Alex Jones saying something a day or a week before is going to meet that standard as the law has been interpreted,” White said. “I anticipate that you will see increasingly creative alternative approaches by federal prosecutors, like conspiracy.” Current and former U.S. authorities said investigators are probably excavating “layers” of rioters’ motivations, including whether any might have been part of any wider conspiracy. Those officials likened the process to investigating street-level drug dealers or gang members who might “flip” and implicate higher-ranking captains or ringleaders. “Every terrorism case I’ve ever worked on . . . has shown something about the radicalization process, or how a person came to harbor the views, animosity and intent to commit a crime of violence,” said Mary McCord, a top national security official at the Justice Department from 2014 to 2017. Trump may have seeded and stoked rioters’ grievances with false claims of election fraud and thinly veiled calls for violence, said McCord, now at Georgetown Law School. But investigators are also probing whether rioters were lone actors or coordinated by others who directed them or provided resources such as money for travel, lodging or weapons, she said. “Just like the kingpin in a conspiracy, the fact he [Trump] gave directions doesn’t mean other conspirators are not guilty,” McCord said. Michael M. Clarke, former lead FBI case agent investigating the 2012 attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, added, “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to think some people conspired.” However, he added, “That doesn’t mean you have a grand conspiracy involving everyone, but you may have loosely connected groups.” Keith L. Alexander, Manuel Roig-Franzia and Robert O’Harrow Jr. contributed to this report.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Hillary Clinton's campaign has lots of excuses for losing. There's the electoral college, James Comey, the media's alleged over-exuberance in digging into Clinton's email server, etc. But Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Thursday that one particular group is especially to blame: millennials. As Karen Tumulty and Philip Rucker reported from the big election postmortem at Harvard on Thursday night: I'll admit I was skeptical. Young people often get blamed for not showing up to vote; they're an easy target that way. What's more, just before the election, polls indicated that young voters — who had previously shunned Clinton — were actually rallying to her in a big way. Digging into the numbers, however, Mook has a point. The national exit poll shows Clinton underperformed Barack Obama's 2012 share of the vote by one point with those between the ages of 30 and 44 and by three points with those ages 45 to 64. She actually overperformed him by one point with those over 65. Among those between 18 and 29, though, she took five points less — 55 percent versus Obama's 60 percent. Here's how those numbers compare to 2012: Clinton's 55-36 margin among those ages 18 to 29 is also significantly worse than late polls suggested it would be. A mid-October poll from the Harvard Institute of Politics showed her leading Trump 49 to 21 with third-party candidates included and 59 to 29 in a two-way matchup with Trump — either a 28- or 30-point margin. A GenForward survey conducted by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, meanwhile, had her up 41 points, 60 to 19. These were large, quality surveys testing only young people, but they differed hugely from the results. Clinton's final margin was 19. They, of course, are national polls, and the race was really decided in a handful of close states — Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in particular. And sure enough, Clinton did even worse among young people in those states, according to exit polls. While Clinton's national margin of victory among young people was only four points worse than Obama's 60-to-37 edge, Michigan's exit poll shows her margin among young people there was five points worse (+28 for Obama vs. +23 for Clinton). In Florida, it was 16 points worse (+34 vs. +18). In Pennsylvania, it was 17 points worse (+28 vs. +9). And in Wisconsin, it was 20 points worse (+23 vs. +3). Caveat: Exit polls, like any polls, are subject to error. Did Trump really only lose young people in Wisconsin by only three points? I'm very skeptical. But if that number is anywhere close to accurate, it accounts for Clinton's narrow loss in the Badger State. The exit polls suggest Clinton netted about half a point overall from young people given she won them 47 to 44 and they comprised 17 percent of the electorate. Obama, by contrast, netted nearly five points when he won them 60 to 37 and they were 21 percent of Wisconsin's electorate. Clinton lost the state by less than a point, so that difference more than accounts for it. We're extrapolating here, and it's inexact, but the fact is that even if Clinton had come anywhere close to Obama's share of the youth vote, she would have held on to Wisconsin. The story is similar in Pennsylvania. Clinton won those under 30 years old 52 to 43 after Obama won them 63 to 35, and in Florida, where Clinton won them 54 to 46 versus Obama's 66 to 32. It was closer in Michigan, where Clinton won the 57 to 34 versus Obama's 63 to 35. But, if you run the numbers in each state, had Clinton simply come closer to Obama's margin with young people, she would have won. So if you accept the exit polls, it's clear Clinton did significantly worse among young people, and it was more than enough to make the difference in the states that mattered. But what if she wasn't supposed to do as well among young people as Obama did? Obama certainly had a unique appeal to them that would seem hard for an older candidate with less of a demonstrated millennial appeal to replicate. That's fair, but it's also worth noting here just how much young people hated Trump. Harvard showed just 22 percent of young likely voters had a favorable opinion of Trump, while 76 percent had an unfavorable one. Basically every poll showed something similar. It's true that young people never seemed to love Clinton. Even Harvard's poll showing her up big revealed that more young likely voters disliked her (51 percent) than liked her (48 percent). But it seemed their distaste for Trump was leading them to coalesce around the lesser of two evils. In the end, it just doesn't appear to have happened as much as Clinton needed it to. In short: Robby Mook was right. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning. By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy",

        "articles": "When I asked Mary Trump why she was suing her uncle, former president Donald Trump, she replied: “Justice. For justice.” Like so many who have tried before, she seeks to hold him accountable, to make good on the tarnished principle that no man is above the law. Impeachment failed — twice — and although criminal investigators have nipped at Trump’s heels for years, he has never been charged with a crime, even in the case where he was identified as the unnamed co-conspirator of his former lawyer, who went to prison. Civil cases differ from criminal cases in obvious ways: They seek money damages; no one goes to prison; and plaintiffs establish their claims by a preponderance of the evidence, not “guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” But civil cases differ in another way, too. They have extensive pretrial discovery. Nothing in a criminal case — or impeachment, for that matter — compares to civil discovery, the process of scooping up evidence from depositions of parties and witnesses, requests for documents, and written questions answered under oath. Discovery is more regimented in criminal cases; it primarily involves the prosecution sharing with the defense the evidence it will use at trial, as well as exculpatory evidence. Civil discovery, in short, can lead to the mother lode. Trump is a defendant in at least 10 civil cases, including his niece’s. A reckoning awaits — one that will require his personal participation in instances where he has no Fifth Amendment privilege to assert, and it is likely to be speedier and more direct than any criminal reckoning. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) elected this route. He filed suit this month against Trump in federal court in the District of Columbia under the Ku Klux Klan Act, which allows damages against anyone conspiring to “prevent by force, intimidation or threat” an official from discharging his duties. His lawsuit alleges that Trump, his son Don Jr., lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) were participants in a conspiracy to interfere with the performance of congressional duties. It alleges that the four spread baseless claims of election fraud and riled up the crowd that ultimately stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. The suit also claims that the defendants were negligent and intentionally inflicted emotional distress. Trump could be sued for damages under the federal Ku Klux Klan Act Once a civil case survives a motion to dismiss (an early stage that tests whether the allegations are legally actionable), discovery begins in earnest — the collection of precisely the sort of evidence Trump vigorously guarded throughout his presidency, hiding behind excessively broad claims of executive privilege or simply refusing to provide it. A private citizen who is a party to a civil lawsuit has to comply. Parties can’t refuse to be deposed. They can’t dodge questions they don’t want to answer — the deposition proceeding requires a response. It is not unheard of for a judge, in a case with a reluctant deponent, to require that a deposition be taken in the courthouse so responses can be compelled if necessary. Parties can object to questions, but only as challenges to their admissibility later on. An answer that proves false can lead to perjury charges. While discovery often proceeds under a protective order, that doesn’t mean the information remains secret forever. Much of it tends to become public as the parties file and argue motions. While some information (that involving national security or something highly personal, for instance) can stay protected, a heavy burden is placed on litigants who seek to keep information from public view. A judge in a civil case pending against the Trump Corporation in the Southern District of New York has adopted rules for her courtroom stating that the public has a right of “access to judicial documents” and required that a motion to seal any materials be made publicly. The party that wants to conceal material has the burden of persuading the court it should remain confidential. Discovery can transcend the civil setting and be of use in a criminal case. The Swalwell suit and one brought by Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), also invoking the KKK Act, parallel the criminal investigation into the Capitol insurrection. This could lead people who believe they may have criminal exposure around the insurrection, including defendants in the civil cases, to invoke the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to avoid being deposed. Doing this would be revelatory — Trump has famously expressed the view that only the guilty take the Fifth. But mere witnesses to events surrounding Jan. 6, lacking any Fifth Amendment privilege, would have to submit to depositions, which might provide fuel for the criminal investigation. Civil cases are often delayed to permit criminal cases to proceed. That’s one way we might find out if the Justice Department, which does not appear now to have an open investigation into Trump or those around him, plans to pursue a criminal case. But evidence of criminal conduct discovered in civil cases can typically be shared with prosecutors. In a recent Washington state case, for example, civil lawyers sued a number of defendants, including the state auditor, Troy Kelley, over misappropriated mortgage fees that were never refunded to borrowers. They developed evidence in the civil case of possible criminal conduct, which they shared with the U.S. attorney in Seattle. Kelley was convicted in a federal trial. A rap sheet for a former president While a criminal investigation could delay proceedings in the Swalwell and Thompson cases, that possibility doesn’t exist in purely civil cases against Trump. The furthest along is Doe v. the Trump Corporation, a class action brought by four anonymous plaintiffs against Trump and his children Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric, essentially alleging that they fraudulently persuaded people to buy into what they billed as business opportunities, which allegedly worked more like multilevel marketing schemes. The case was argued in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in January after the Trumps made a belated effort to send the case to arbitration. A district judge ruled they had acted in bad faith, and no arbitration agreement applied. If, as seems likely, the 2nd Circuit affirms and sends the case back to the district court, the Trumps will be out of luck, and discovery will commence. Donald Trump is also the defendant in two separate cases brought by women who say he defamed them after they accused him of rape or sexual assault. Summer Zervos’s case is awaiting the result of an appeal in New York state’s highest court. E. Jean Carroll sued Trump after he accused her of fabricating a claim of rape. That case is on appeal in the 2nd Circuit, with Trump claiming immunity because his comments were made in the course of his official duties as president. It’s hard to see how that applies to ridiculing a woman over an alleged rape that occurred decades ago; the Justice Department should reverse course and discontinue former attorney general William P. Barr’s position that DOJ should defend Trump in this case. It seems highly likely that the 2nd Circuit will send the case back to the trial court, where discovery can begin. The case is straightforward in scope. Depositions of the only witnesses — Trump, Carroll and two friends with whom she shared details of the alleged rape contemporaneously — could be taken expeditiously. Carroll also seeks a DNA sample from Trump to see if it matches that on the dress she wore at the time of the alleged rape. The case could proceed speedily to trial. And in any dispositive motion brought to dismiss the case, there would likely be public briefing and argument. Evidence offered by both sides would come to light in a case that turns on whether the former president raped Carroll. In her lawsuit, Trump’s niece Mary alleges that she learned from a New York Times report that her inheritance from her father, which her uncle had managed along with other family members since she was 16, was fraudulently handled. Her complaint alleges that “all told, they fleeced her of tens of millions of dollars or more.” This case, filed more recently and moving more slowly than other civil matters, confronts Trump with the possibility of a full-on inquiry into family finances, something he described as a red line during the Mueller investigation and has consistently sought to avoid. Trump, at some point, will undoubtedly dub the civil cases a new type of witch hunt, brought by so many people, often women, for so many alleged wrongs. He has the opportunity to challenge the legal sufficiency of each case, meaning a judge would decide if there is enough basis to proceed. So far, most of these cases are well past the point where Trump can write them off as harassment. He will have to defend them on the merits. It’s uncertain whether Trump will ever be indicted, but any criminal process would be lengthy and involve years of appeals. Civil lawsuits provide an alternate path to learning the truth and achieving a measure of accountability. I am reminded that the Ku Klux Klan was broken in Alabama not by criminal prosecutions but by a civil lawsuit that led to its bankruptcy.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old In September 2003, Attorney General John Ashcroft called out the librarians. The American Library Association and civil liberties groups, he said, were pushing \"baseless hysteria\" about the controversial Patriot Act. He suggested that they were worried that spy agencies wanted to know \"how far you have gotten on the latest Tom Clancy novel.\" Ashcroft was 17 speeches into a national speaking tour defending the Patriot Act, a law expanding government surveillance powers that passed nearly unanimously in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. And all along the way, the librarians showed up to protest. In the case of government surveillance, they are not shushing. They've been among the loudest voices urging freedom of information and privacy protections. Edward Snowden's campaign against the National Security Agency's data collection program has energized this group once again. And a new call to action from the ALA's president means their voices could be louder and more coordinated than ever. Guarding patrons' library activities is considered a core value of the profession, written into the ALA's code of ethics: \"We protect each library user's right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted.\" Over the years, the U.S. government has tested the limits of how far librarians will go to defend that code. Near the end of the Cold War, FBI agents asked New York City librarians to watch for patrons who might be diplomats from foreign hostile powers trying to recruit intelligence agents or gathering intelligence. Library officials were alarmed. \"These things are so far removed from the professional duties of a librarian that I find it almost inconceivable that this whole thing is happening,'' Nancy Lian, head of the New York Library Association, said in a New York Times article at the time. A judicial order, she noted, would be required for such action. Early resistance Library groups were wary of the Patriot Act from the start, according to Emily Sheketoff, head the ALA's Washington office. \"We were engaged because we feared that the government would overstep,\" Sheketoff said, a fear she believes has been validated. Given the political climate after Sept. 11, even individual legislators who said they agreed in principle didn't pull their support of the bill. \"It was a steamroll that we couldn't even slow down,\" she said. After the bill passed, the group trained library employees around the country on how to respond if the government requested information. Section 215 of the act - later used to justify the bulk collection of domestic phone metadata as revealed by Snowden - was called the \"library provision.\" The implication was that the government could use it to get library records. By 2003, some libraries placed signs in their lobbies, warning patrons that the government could obtain their records under the bill. Hundreds of meetings were organized to discuss the privacy implications of the law at libraries around the country. Stewart Baker, the assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, said it was a \"disservice to public debate\" that Section 215 was ever known as the library provision, arguing that there was no evidence it was used in the context suggested by library groups. When Ashcroft's promotion tour rolled around, many of his talks took place behind closed doors while librarians and civil liberties advocates protested nearby. The backlash to his comments was fierce. \"It turns out people like and trust their local librarians,\" Sheketoff said. As a result, Ashcroft telephoned Carla Hayden, then-president of the association. \"I must say, it was quite something,\" Hayden said. \"When you have the opportunity to express something to a person in that position, you want to do it well.\" Hayden said she reminded Ashcroft that libraries were open to working with law enforcement through judicial channels. But, she said, she believed the Patriot Act went beyond that relationship. Hayden said Ashcroft \"expressed that he was sorry that he might have said something that could have been offensive - and that he didn't intend that.\" In fact, Hayden said, he told her that he had \"good library experiences in his life.\" Ashcroft did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Baker believes the apology came as a result of the librarians' media campaign. But in his view, Ashcroft was justified. As he put it: \"The implication of their campaign was that library records across the country were being rifled through by people in the name of national security trying to figure out who was reading books they disapproved of - that was pretty clearly what the parade of horribles suggested and that Section 215 was somehow implicated in that. And none of that is true.\" The Connecticut Four Within two years of Ashcroft's apology, four library officials in Connecticut found themselves in a legal battle over handing over patron information - and unable to talk about it. In July 2005, two FBI agents presented George Christian with a national security letter - an information request that doesn't require judicial approval - seeking data about patrons' library use. He was the executive director of a consortium called Library Connection. Such letters existed before the Patriot Act and did not derive from Section 215. But their use was expanded by the law. The government wanted to know who had used a device at an IP address in February, Christian said. The address was assigned to a router that served many devices, and to hand over that data could have violated the privacy of many patrons beyond the subjects of the FBI's investigation, said Christian, an accidental librarian who is trained as a software developer. Christian questioned the constitutionality of the search. The most astounding part, he said, was the gag order attached to the letter. \"It was perpetual, with no expiration date,\" he said. Such conditions are a standard feature of national security letters, requiring recipients to keep secret even the fact that they received a letter. \"Gag orders were made controversial,\" Baker said. \"They're a routine feature of a lot of criminal and other investigations whenever you don't want the defendant or the suspect to know you're investigating them.\" Instead of keeping quiet, Christian called an emergency board meeting. His colleagues unanimously decided to challenge the request. The American Civil Liberties Union agreed to take up the case. The group was already representing an Internet service provider fighting a similar request and was looking for a library to join the challenge. Because of the gag order, none of the four library officials - Christian, Barbara Bailey, Peter Chase and Jan Nocek - could add their names to the suit. The four were known as John Doe throughout the case. During the first hearing, none could be in the courtroom, lest their identities be revealed. \"We watched it from a closed-circuit television in Hartford,\" Bailey said. Their identities eventually slipped to the media through faulty redaction in court documents related to the case. Even then, the four were unable to speak out - or testify about it during a debate over the Patriot Act's renewal. \"It was incredibly stressful,\" Christian said. The group was bound to silence until May 2006, when the government withdrew the request - and with it the gag order. That made the \"Connecticut Four,\" as they have come to be known in library circles, among the only recipients of such an order who can publicly discuss the experience. Library advocacy in a post-Snowden world Snowden's leaks have only deepened the concern about the degradation of privacy rights. \"Now we know that it really didn't matter what they passed,\" Sheketoff said. \"What they were sweeping up was everything, way beyond what anybody had ever envisioned.\" Librarians have deployed new methods to protect patron privacy. \"As technology has changed and we've moved from the card catalogue and paper records to electronic records, we are always looking to destroy the record as soon we can,\" Sheketoff said. \"When you return a book, the record is destroyed so that when the government comes we can say that we legitimately only know what you have out at the time.\" In Massachusetts, the local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union has partnered with some librarians to deploy services like anonymous browsing tool Tor that can shield patrons' activity from electronic snooping. The ALA backs reform of surveillance laws - specifically the bipartisan Senate version of the USA Freedom Act, which would limit data collection under Section 215. Allies in the civil liberties community praise the group's track record. As Kevin Bankston, policy director at New America's Open Technology Institute, put it: \"Librarians are on the front lines of the information society, charged with providing easy access to information for all, and are often some of the first to raise their voices over emerging Internet policy issues, whether around online censorship, digital copyright, or most often post-9/11, overreaching surveillance.\" ALA President Courtney Young has called for the group's 57,000 members to pledge an hour a week to advocacy - including reaching out to members of Congress. For his part, Christian has grown less optimistic as the push to reform the law has dragged on. \"We are obviously all in trouble,\" he said. \"What happened to us seems like kindergarten compared to the revelations from Snowden.\" The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old EL CAJON, Calif. — Police in this city near San Diego shot and killed an apparently unarmed black man within a minute after arriving at a strip mall here Tuesday to answer a call of a man acting erratically, a police official said Wednesday. Two officers had arrived at the scene about 2:10 p.m., said El Cajon police department spokesman Lt. Rob Ransweile. When the man pulled something from his pocket and took “a shooting stance,” an officer opened fire, hitting the man multiple times. The shooting happened at 2:11 p.m., Ransweile said. Police identified the man as Alfred Olango and relatives described him as “mentally challenged,” saying that his sister had called police to say that he was walking in traffic and “not acting like himself.” The police and the county district attorney will both investigate the shooting, officials said. Residents who gathered at the scene Tuesday night and on Wednesday called for authorities to release video footage showing what happened. Olango’s death came as tension lingers in Charlotte over a deadly police shooting there a week earlier, which sparked a renewed focus nationwide on how officers use deadly force, and it prompted protests and a prayer vigil in this city in Southern California. In an interview with a local radio talk show host, Mayor Bill Wells said he expected demonstrations to be peaceful but said the local police force, with 120 officers, “has more than enough manpower to handle whatever comes.” Later addressing a news conference, Wells said he is willing to meet with the protesters. “We are open to dialogue. We are open to listening to your complaints,” he said. “I am begging El Cajon to remain peaceful and harmonious place.” Promising transparency in the investigation, Wells said he has viewed the entire video and that once the public sees it, they will be able to determine what happened. On Tuesday, police released a still shot from the video that purported to show the shooter’s stance. Without going into the details of the incident, Wells said he was concerned about the time it took for the police to respond to the call from the victim’s sister. When police responded, Olango initially “refused multiple instructions by the first officer on the scene and concealed his hand in his pants pocket,” Jeff Davis, the city’s police chief, said during a news conference. Davis said a second officer arrived and was prepared to use a Taser to stun Olango, who was pacing while officers spoke to him. “At one point, the male rapidly drew an object from his front pants pocket, placed both hands together on it and extended it rapidly toward the officer, taking what appeared to be a shooting stance, putting the object in the officer’s face,” Davis said. Police identified the object as a “vape smoking device.” As one officer used the Taser to try to subdue Olango, “simultaneously, the officer who had the object pointed at him” fired his gun and hit Olango, Davis said. No gun was found at the scene, he said. The Washington Post’s police shootings database Police say Olango, 38, was struck multiple times, given first aid at the scene and pronounced dead at a hospital. The two officers involved, who have not been identified, have been placed on three-day administrative leave. Friends said that Olango may have suffered a seizure before the incident on Tuesday. Olango was an immigrant from Uganda who was working as a cook, relatives said Wednesday. Olango had a series of run-ins with police in San Diego County and Colorado, according to court records. He had convictions for car theft, burglary and selling drugs and had served time in prison. Mental health issues are a factor in about a quarter of fatal police shootings, according to a Washington Post database tracking such incidents nationwide. Olango was at least the 716th person shot and killed by police this year. In 2016, 172 of those who have died had mental health issues. Police are on pace to shoot to death about the same number of people this year as last year, when officers fatally shot nearly 1,000 people. People with reported mental health issues account for about one in four of the fatal shootings this year, the same share as last year. Experts say such shootings highlight the issue of how often police are called to respond to people in mental or emotional crisis — and whether police training adequately prepares them to handle those calls. In most cases last year where people with reported mental illnesses were fatally shot by police, police were responding because relatives or bystanders were worried about the person behaving erratically; last year, this included dozens of explicitly suicidal people. Baltimore police cuffed, stunned and shot people in mental health crisis, even if they posed no threat On Wednesday morning, about three dozen residents held a news conference outside police headquarters to demand the release of the full video of the incident. Tension building from other controversial shootings nationwide was evident in this blue-collar, mostly white city of 103,000. “I have been a black man for 56 years. None of this is new to me,” said Eddie Price. He implored reporters to tell how black people are treated by police. “I am tired of walking around like I am a target, like my son is a target,” he said. One person held a sign that read “Stop the genocide,” while activist Armand King, 34, said “the police murdered someone last night.” Mallory Webb, president of local NAACP Youth Council, called for an end to “these senseless killings” and said the killings of black men by police are “the modern-day equivalent of lynchings.” Wednesday night, a demonstration began peacefully as police in riot gear watched. At one point, a young Donald Trump supporter got into a scuffle with several protesters objecting to his wearing a hat with the Republican presidential candidate’s slogan, “Make America Great Again.” The man was knocked to the ground until other protesters intervened to protect him. Back on his feet, he quickly ran away as police arrived. Police are on pace to fatally shoot the same number of people in 2016 as 2015 Davis, the police chief, asked residents to allow time for the shooting in El Cajon to be investigated thoroughly. He promised transparency and said that “this will be looked at by many sets of eyes, not just ours.” Video of the immediate aftermath of the shooting was uploaded to Facebook Live by Rumbie Mubaiwa. The footage shows a woman, reportedly the sister of the victim, wailing uncontrollably and repeating the phrase, “You just killed my brother.” “I called you to help me, but you killed my brother,” the sister said. In a recorded interview with KNSD, Michael Rodriguez, who said he had been 15 to 20 feet away from the shooting, said, “I see a black male coming out with his hands up.” According to Rodriguez, three officers approached the man, and when he tried to run, Rodriguez said, they fired five shots into his torso. But the man’s sister told KNSD that her brother was not showing his hands to police and was not complying with the police’s orders. Andrews and Berman reported from Washington.

        "articles": "Martin Klingst is Washington bureau chief of the weekly German newspaper Die Zeit. Lately it seems that not a day goes by without a Republican presidential candidate portraying Europe as a socialist nightmare. Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum paint a picture of the Old World as unfree, strangulated by bureaucratic and inefficient welfare systems, and unable to reform and modernize. To these Republicans, Europe seems to be the antipode to everything America is meant to be. I understand that stump speeches are coarse and that, to Republican candidates, Europe must be bad because President Obama occasionally praises some of its achievements, such as universal health care or the “green” revolution. I also know there is an American tradition of holding up the Old World as an example of all that is wrong and corrupt. There is, unfortunately, a more recent European custom of blaming the United States for all that is perverse and profane. Moreover, there are good reasons to worry about Europe’s fiscal calamities, which stem in part from the unaffordable benefits for its citizens. It is understandable that some on this side of the Atlantic fear that the European debt crisis could drag the slowly recovering U.S. economy under. But when Romney, Gingrich and Santorum warn about “socialist Europe,” they sound as though they are talking about the Soviet empire, which vanished long ago. Europe is the European Union, a modern entity of 27 democratic countries that, despite many commonalities, greatly differ in history, culture, language, sociology and politics. Europe is difficult to comprehend, but viewing it through a single lens is like calling the United States a Third World nation because there are very poor areas in the South where some people live in shacks or have little access to health care or where some schools are corridors of shame. My problem as a European living in the United States is that it is not Joe the Plumber who is bashing Europe but three longtime politicians who want to be president — people who should know better. Wasn’t Mitt Romney a missionary in France? Hasn’t he spoken fluent French since the late 1960s? I do not recall any important European politician who ran for prime minister or president and pilloried the United States in the same manner. Even when German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder came out against the imminent Iraq war before seeking reelection in 2002, the rhetoric was muted in comparison. It is not necessary here to define socialism or to detail the many distinctions between a state-run economy and a social democracy based on a ­free-market system. But those who seek to be president of a global superpower — and may perhaps one day sit at a table with leaders of the Old World — should know a few things: All 27 E.U. members believe, more or less, in mandatory health-care insurance and public education. They believe that government should offer a helping hand to struggling businesses and people during economic downturns. That is why we pay high taxes. It is also true that a number of E.U. countries have irresponsibly expanded their welfare systems and can no longer afford their bills. But some countries have carried out necessary economic reforms, engineered their comeback and managed the storm of the Great Recession quite well. To some extent they can now present better results than the United States. Germany, for example, raised its retirement age to 67 and drastically reformed its social safety net, lowering labor costs to businesses. Thanks to government subsidies, German enterprises were able to keep their skilled workers employed during the recession. When business picked up again, the labor force was in place and the economy more competitive. Unemployment is at a 20-year low of about 6 percent. Several European states run their mandatory health-care systems more efficiently and at lower cost than the United States while guaranteeing every citizen access to affordable and up-to-date services. The population’s health remains an important economic factor. Moreover, while the national debt is disastrous in Greece or Italy, debt remains at a much more responsible level in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. Romney pointed out in New Hampshire last month that, despite the economic downturn, the average U.S. worker still takes home a bigger monthly paycheck than the average European (and even the average German, who makes more than, say, Romanians). That’s true, but the comparison doesn’t take into account the much greater wealth gap in the United States nor the fact that Americans have to spend larger portions of their income on medical care and education. A college education is still free in most Old World countries and produces generally better results than in the United States. The Program for International Student Assessment study by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, released in December, shows that high school students in a number of E.U. countries scored better in reading, math and science than their U.S. counterparts. Another OECD report shows that it is much easier for Germans, Swedes, Danes, Norwegians and Spaniards to climb the socioeconomic ladder than Americans. That’s a stark reversal from the time when greater social mobility was a main reason so many Europeans flocked to the land of opportunity. Comparing data across societies is risky because cultural and social differences may not be reflected. Yes, pendulums swing. But framing Europe simply as inflexible and outdated, or backward and socialistic, is shortsightedand wrong. Romney, Gingrich and Santorum should know as well as anyone that the globe is no longer flat.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old THE MORNING PLUM: With House Republicans widely expected to pass the final version of the Trump/GOP tax plan today, a new CNN poll shows that opposition has only grown. Just 33 percent of Americans favor the plan, while 55 percent oppose it — a rise of 10 points since last month. And a whopping 66 percent say the plan will do more to benefit the wealthy than the middle class. As it happens, this reading of the GOP tax plan is entirely correct. The new Tax Policy Center analysis of the bill tells the story. It finds that in 2027, 53 percent of taxpayers will see a tax hike, relative to current law. That’s because the plan makes the individual rate cuts and the preferences that will benefit lower earners temporary, while establishing an inflation index that nudges people into higher income brackets over time, to limit the impact on the long-term deficit. Meanwhile, the bill makes the corporate tax cuts (which overwhelmingly go to shareholders and capital, and thus mainly to the rich) permanent. The key to understanding the plan’s regressiveness is in the distribution of the tax cuts and tax hikes that will hit in 2027. I’ve created a chart, using the TPC’s data, that tells this story: As you can see, the groups who see a tax hike in 2027 are heavily concentrated in the lower-income quintiles. By contrast, more than three quarters of the top 1 percent get a tax cut — an average tax cut of nearly $40,000. And more than 90 percent of the top 0.1 percent get a tax cut — an average tax cut of more than $200,000. Republicans have said that passing this plan is key to staving off a disaster in the midterms. They are hoping to sell it to voters by claiming that at its core, it is a middle-class tax cut, and they are hoping that the tax cuts that working- and middle-class Americans see in the short term will make this claim credible. It is true that in the short term, the vast majority of taxpayers will see a tax cut. But even in the short term, the plan is very regressive. Here’s another chart that demonstrates this, using the TPC data: Next year, the bottom three quintiles get an average tax cut of less than $1,000, while the top 1 percent gets an average tax cut of more than $50,000, and the top 0.1 percent gets an average tax cut of nearly $200,000. By 2025, the lower quintiles get approximately the same-sized tax cut, while the average tax cut for the top 1 percent jumps to higher than $60,000, and the average tax cut for the top 0.1 percent jumps to more than a quarter of a million dollars. And over time, as the first chart shows, more and more in the lower quintiles end up paying higher taxes, even as the very wealthiest Americans continue to enjoy huge benefits. Indeed, the TPC data show that by 2027, more than 80 percent of the plan’s benefits go to the top 1 percent. As Dylan Matthews points out, this is even worse than a previous iteration of the bill. The plan gets increasingly regressive over time. But this feature of it is essential to maintaining the GOP priorities at the core of the bill and to the GOP’s hopes of passing something that embodies those priorities. Republicans must pass the plan with only GOP votes, because Democrats will not accept a plan that lavishes such an enormous share of its benefits on the rich, and Republicans will not accept a plan that does not do that. So Republicans must pass it through the Senate by simple majority, which requires keeping it from raising the deficit over the long term. Managing that — while also keeping the tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the rich permanent — required them to make the tax cuts that benefit everyone else temporary. Thus, the plan’s increasingly regressive nature is essential on multiple levels. Republicans will try to get around the awful politics of this by arguing that in the short term, the middle class gets both a tax cut and will also benefit from the explosion of growth and wages that cutting taxes on corporations will supposedly produce. But very few economists believe that the latter will come to pass. And given the size of the tax cuts for less fortunate Americans relative to those that top earners will enjoy, it is far more likely that voters will continue to see the plan as a giveaway to the rich. Which is exactly what it is. * MUELLER PROBE SET TO ENTER ‘MORE CONTENTIOUS PHASE’: Trump’s lawyers are meeting with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III this week, to ask whether he’s close to wrapping up. But The Post reports that the investigation still has a long way to go: The dynamic here is that Trump’s lawyers are telling him he’s close to getting cleared, but if this doesn’t happen soon, it could set him off and cause him to try to close it all down. * GOP TAX BILL COULD HURT REPUBLICANS IN SUBURBS: Republicans say they must pass the tax bill to prevent a 2018 bloodbath. But the Washington Examiner reports that it is likely to hurt them in the suburbs, where control of the House may be decided: One GOP strategist actually says: “Step one is passing the bill. Step two is selling it.” But the real problem isn’t that Republicans just need a good sales pitch; it’s the bill itself. * TRUMP UNLEASHES STREAM OF DISTORTIONS IN SPEECH: Linda Qiu fact-checks Trump’s big national security speech yesterday and finds a pattern: He repeatedly used distortions to aggrandize his influence or to claim to be breaking records: The constant need to do this remains remarkable and unsettling. * TRUMP’S APPROVAL IS IN THE TOILET: The new CNN poll also finds that Trump’s approval rating sits at 35 percent, which is “his worst mark yet in CNN polling”: Here is one record that Trump actually is breaking! * OBAMACARE’S FUTURE IN DOUBT: The New York Times reports that some health-care experts think the Affordable Care Act’s future may be in doubt, now that the GOP tax plan repeals the individual mandate, but that remains to be seen: Republicans say this will liberate people from having to buy insurance, while taking the money that would have made insurance cheaper for those who will now go without it to pay for corporate tax cuts. * AND TRUMP WORRIED GORSUCH WOULD NOT BE ‘LOYAL’: The Post reports that Trump considered rescinding Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court, because he was angry over Gorsuch’s criticism of his attacks on the judiciary as “disheartening”: Of course, Trump’s anger and expectation of Gorsuch’s loyalty only underscore that Gorsuch was, if anything, not disheartened enough by Trump’s view of the judiciary’s proper role.

        "articles": "Are we spending our democracy into oblivion? This is the time of year when media scribblers bemoan how nasty political campaigns have become. The complainers are accused of a dainty form of historical ignorance by defenders of mud-slinging who drag out Finley Peter Dunne’s 1895 assertion that “politics ain’t beanbag.” Politics has always been nasty, the argument goes, so we should get over it. In fact, structural changes in our politics are making campaigns more mean and personal than ever. Even Dunne might be surprised. Outside groups empowered by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision are using mass media in ways that turn off Americans to democracy, aggravate divisions between the political parties and heighten animosities among citizens of differing views. Studies of this year’s political advertising show that outside groups are blanketing the airwaves with messages far more negative than those purveyed by the candidates themselves. That shouldn’t surprise us in the least. “Candidates can be held accountable for their ads,” says Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a consumer organization that is trying to encourage candidates to disown “dark money.” “The outside groups are unknown, and have confusing names.” No one is advertising under the moniker “Influence Peddlers for Crummy Politics.” There is far too much complacency about big money’s role in this year’s campaigns, on the grounds that both sides have plenty of it. This misses the point. “It doesn’t balance it out if you have billionaire Republicans battling billionaire Democrats,” says Weissman. “You still have billionaires setting the agenda for the election.” Moreover, a focus just on this year’s competitive Senate and House races misses the enormous impact a handful of very wealthy people can have on state and local campaigns. A new report by the Brennan Center for Justice details how, at a relatively modest cost to themselves, a privileged few can change how government that is supposed to be nearest to the people is actually carried out. “At this scale, you don’t have to be a Koch brother to be a kingmaker,” the report informs us. Worse, the supposedly “independent” spending of the super-rich kingmakers isn’t independent at all. The report documents how closely the activities of supposedly outside groups are coordinated with insiders and the candidates themselves. Like everything else in our politics these days, Citizens United is usually debated along ideological lines. Progressives typically hate it. Conservatives usually defend it. But citizens of every persuasion should be worried about what this precedent-shattering decision has unleashed. More than ever, politics is the only profession that regularly advertises against itself. If voters feel cynical, the outside groups — on both sides — are doing all they can to encourage their disenchantment. A study by the Wesleyan Media Project of ads aired between Aug. 29 and Sept. 11 found that 55 percent of ads in U.S. Senate elections were negative, up from 43.7 percent over the same period in 2010. Wesleyan found that 91.4 percent of the ads run by outside groups in support of Democrats were negative, compared with 41.9 percent of those run by Democratic candidates themselves. For Republicans, 77.9 percent of the group ads were negative, compared with only 12.3 percent of the candidate ads. Negative ads were down slightly in the next two-week period, but there were still more negative commercials run this year than in the comparable period in 2010. Defenders of massive spending on advertising, positive or negative, will make the case that at least the ads engage voters. Not necessarily, and certainly not this year. Indeed, the Pew Research Center found in early October that only 15 percent of Americans are following the elections “very closely.” Interest in the campaign, says Scott Keeter, director of survey research at Pew, “is the lowest it has been at this point in an off-year election in at least two decades.” Hardly a day goes by without someone lamenting how polarized our politics has become. Can anyone seriously contend that the current way of running and financing elections is disconnected from the difficulty politicians have in working together? “How are they supposed to get along with the other side the day after the election?” Weissman asks. Writing recently in Foreign Affairs, the sometimes dissident conservative writer David Frum argues that “the radicalization of the party’s donor base has led Republicans in Congress to try tactics they would never have dared use before.” Thus the tragic irony: Citizens United is deepening our divisions and turning more citizens into bystanders. Our republic can do better. Read more from E.J. Dionne’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook. Read more about this topic: E.J.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Lawmakers are growing tired of corporate America's persistent efforts to dodge U.S. taxes. In the past month, Congress and the White House have denounced a loophole that lets companies lower their tax rate by moving their headquarters overseas. These so-called \"inversions\" have been the subject on Congressional hearings and legislation to eliminate the tax benefit. Now, a group of Democrats in Congress want to make sure that any company that incorporates overseas would be barred from doing business with the government. The No Federal Contracts for Corporate Deserters Act (yes, that's really the name), would bar contracts from going to companies that reincorporate, are at least 50 percent owned by American shareholders and have no substantial business in the foreign country where they are incorporated. “We ought to put a stop to all inversions, but at the very least, we should stop these companies from receiving federal funding from the same American families who have to pick up the tax burden inverted companies shrug off,” said Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), who introduced the bill in the Senate with Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.). Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) introduced a companion bill in the House. This is not the first time that Congress has tried to prevent companies that use inversions from doing business with the government. Congress has passed several laws in the last dozen years to address the problem. But companies have been able to avoid the ban by exploiting a key loophole that exempts firms who have merged with or bought a foreign competitor. It is the same sort of loophole that has allowed companies to circumvent a broader 2004 law that reduced the tax benefits of companies that incorporate overseas. A recent report from the Congressional Research Service found that 47 U.S. companies have reincorporated overseas since 2003, nearly double the amount that did in the 20 years before. At least a dozen of the companies that have inverted in the past four years -- including Stratasys and Alkermes -- have won government contracts during that time. \"The federal government has been subsidizing this bad behavior by continuing to reward inverted companies with lucrative federal contracts,\" DeLauro said. \"These companies take advantage of our education system, our research and development incentives, our skilled workforce and our infrastructure, all supported by U.S. taxpayers, to build their businesses. But when the tax bill comes due, they hide overseas.\" The widespread use of inversions gained attention in recent months when high-profile U.S. pharmaceutical companies -- Pfizer, AbbVie and Medtronic -- made bids to merge with overseas rivals. Critics of the deals viewed them as thinly-veiled attempts by American firms to shift their tax burden to countries with lower tax rates. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has urged Congress to take action to eliminate the tax benefits for companies that incorporate overseas, throwing his support behind retroactive legislation that would apply to many cross-border deals announced in the last year. If the series of deals in progress go through, researchers at the Joint Commission on Taxation say they could rob the U.S. Treasury of $20 billion in revenue over a decade. In his weekly radio address Saturday, President Obama called out corporations using inversions to skirt U.S. taxes. \"When some companies cherrypick their taxes, it damages the country’s finances,\" he said. \"It adds to the deficit. It makes it harder to invest in the things that will keep America strong, and it sticks you with the tab for what they stash offshore.\" Obama said the best way to address tax avoidance is through comprehensive tax reform that lowers the corporate tax rate and simplifies the tax code. With little to no movement on that front, Obama urged lawmakers to at least close the inversion loophole.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old On Friday, 27 Americans, including 18 children, joined the casualties making up the highest gun-related death rate in the developed world. Those who died Friday at Sandy Hook Elementary School are, statistically speaking, a drop in the bucket. So was the .223-caliber rifle that killed them. The United States of America has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world, followed by Yemen, where it is about half. In July, after a horrific shooting at a Colorado movie theater, as journalists and others began asking whether America's unique and extraordinary gun laws had anything to do with its unique and extraordinary rate of gun-related deaths, I looked into Japan's gun laws in an article for TheAtlantic.com. The contrast between the United States and Japan could not be starker. If the United States has the loosest gun laws in the developed world, then Japan has the strictest. Most guns are illegal, with onerous restrictions on the few that are legal. Police also have far broader search-and-seizure powers. But the country also has a remarkably low rate of firearm deaths. In 2008, when the United States experienced over 12,000 gun-related homicides, Japan had only 11, or fewer than half as many killed Friday in Newtown, Conn. That same year in the United States, 587 were killed just by accidental gun discharges. In 2006 in Japan, a nation of 128 million people, only two were killed by guns. Here are some excerpts from what I wrote in July about the lessons of Japan's remarkably strict, but breathtakingly effective, gun control laws. The lessons for the United States here are potentially quite thorny. Japan's ultra-strict gun laws, and its police powers to enforce them, require substantial sacrifices in an area that American political culture, and indeed American culture, consider sacrosanct: individual liberty. That U.S. firearm law developed to protect gun rights first and public safety second, whereas Japan privileged public safety, is both telling and reflects feelings and priorities that go much deeper than just this one issue. That's not something that can be reversed with a single bill or news conference, not that I'm arguing it should be. The individual liberty vs. public safety trade-off is not an easy one to make, and though Japan's policy does appear to save thousands of lives when compared to America's, it comes at real costs. What is perhaps most revealing about looking at Japan's gun laws, and seeing what makes them the most extreme gun restrictions in the developed world, is that it gives you a sense, for better or worse, of what American gun laws look like to everyone else.

        "articles": "Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) has the right to live in a make-believe wonderland if he so chooses. But his party and his nation will pay a terrible price for his hallucinations about the nature of today’s Republican Party. And even this sacrifice might not guarantee that Manchin can hold on to support back home. Manchin’s declaration Sunday that he will vote against sweeping legislation to guarantee voting rights nationwide and that he “will not vote to weaken or eliminate” the Senate filibuster is a huge blow to President Biden’s hopes of enacting his ambitious agenda. There’s no way to spin this as anything other than awful. Manchin’s decision is a catastrophe not just for this particular bill, though he has almost certainly doomed the legislation. A senior administration official told me Monday that “none of this is a surprise to those who have heard Manchin’s views” and that the White House will continue working to “make progress notwithstanding the difficult challenges in front of us, including a 50-vote Senate.” But thanks to Manchin’s decision, Biden doesn’t even have a 50-vote Senate for what many Democrats see as an existential fight against the GOP’s attempt to gain and keep power through voter suppression. The 49 Senate votes left after Manchin’s defection will take Biden and the Democrats precisely nowhere. Worse, Manchin is asking Democrats to respond to ruthlessness with delusion. In an op-ed in the West Virginia paper the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Manchin said he will oppose the For the People Act, passed by the House in March, because it has no Republican support. “I believe that partisan voting legislation will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy,” he wrote. Manchin did say he supports another proposed House bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would essentially restore provisions of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act forbidding some states to change election laws without obtaining preclearance from the Justice Department. The original preclearance rules were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. But Manchin wants this, too, to win bipartisan support. Unless Manchin changes his position on the filibuster, 10 Republican senators would have to cross the aisle and join with Democrats. So far, there is one — Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). The other nine must be in some parallel dimension, visible only to Manchin, where all the leprechauns, tooth fairies and unicorns are hiding. Inconveniently for Manchin’s fantasies of unity, the fact is that one of our major parties — the one Manchin ostensibly belongs to — believes in guaranteeing access to the polls for all eligible voters, making political donations more transparent, tightening ethics rules for members of Congress and ensuring that congressional districts are drawn fairly. The other party doesn’t want to do any of those things, because Republicans see these reforms as threatening the GOP’s ability to win national elections with the support of a minority of voters. Trump’s incoherent policies so robbed the GOP of any consistent philosophy that last year’s national convention did not even attempt to produce a party platform. Republicans have replaced ideological litmus tests with pledges of loyalty to the former president. Opposing efforts to expand and guarantee voting rights appears to be the one policy idea they can all agree on. Look, I understand the reality of Manchin’s situation. He is himself a political unicorn — a Democrat sent to the Senate by one of the most Republican states in the country. But insisting on bipartisanship in all things might not be a magical talisman against defeat. A new survey of 600 likely 2022 general election voters from West Virginia commissioned by End Citizens United, a Democratic group advocating for passage of the For the People Act, and conducted by the polling firm ALG Research shows that Manchin is viewed favorably by 43 percent of voters and unfavorably by 50 percent. (The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.) One poll question suggests a contradiction that implies the limits of Manchin’s dedication to defying political gravity, both at home and in Washington. The self-identified non-conservative Democrats who provide Manchin’s strongest base of support, with 59 percent viewing him favorably, are also the most skeptical of the filibuster Manchin has pledged himself to protect. Twenty percent of them say the filibuster should be eliminated, and another 45 percent say it should be reformed. Forty-three percent of West Virginians overall say the filibuster should remain unchanged. That is just one poll, and Manchin’s history of winning suggests he knows his state. But even Manchin has to hold on to his strongest supporters. Blocking Biden’s agenda and allowing GOP voter suppression are not stances that will help him win his next election or change Washington’s increasingly twisted laws of politics. In this fairy tale, Manchin is setting himself up to be the villain.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old President Trump’s advisers and allies are increasingly worried that he has neither the staff nor the strategy to protect himself from a possible Democratic takeover of the House, which would empower the opposition party to shower the administration with subpoenas or even pursue impeachment charges. Within Trump’s orbit, there is consensus that his current legal team is not equipped to effectively navigate an onslaught of congressional demands, and there has been broad discussion about bringing on new lawyers experienced in white-collar defense and political scandals. The president and some of his advisers have discussed possibly adding veteran defense attorney Abbe Lowell, who currently represents Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, to Trump’s personal legal team if an impeachment battle or other fights with Congress emerge after the midterm elections, according to people familiar with the discussions. Trump advisers also are discussing recruiting experienced legal firepower to the Office of White House Counsel, which is facing departures and has dwindled in size at a critical juncture. The office has about 25 lawyers now, down from roughly 35 earlier in the presidency, according to a White House official with direct knowledge. Trump announced Wednesday that Donald McGahn will depart as White House counsel this fall, once the Senate confirms Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh. Three of McGahn’s deputies — Greg Katsas, Uttam Dhillon and Makan Delrahim — have departed, and a fourth, Stefan Passantino, will have his last day Friday. That leaves John Eisenberg, who handles national security, as the lone deputy counsel. Trump recently has consulted his personal attorneys about the likelihood of impeachment proceedings. And McGahn and other aides have invoked the prospect of impeachment to persuade the president not to take actions or behave in ways that they believe would hurt him, officials said. Still, Trump has not directed his lawyers or his political aides to prepare an action plan, leaving allies to fret that the president does not appreciate the magnitude of what could be in store next year. This account of the president and his team grappling with a potential crisis is based on interviews this week with 26 White House officials, presidential advisers, and lawyers and strategists close to the administration, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said he and the president have discussed the possibility that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III will issue a damning report to Congress. “We’ve talked a lot about impeachment at different times,” Giuliani said. “It’s the only thing that hangs out there. They can’t [criminally] charge him.” If Democrats control the House, the oversight committees likely would use their subpoena power as a weapon to assail the administration, investigating with a vengeance. The committees could hold hearings about policies such as the travel ban affecting majority-Muslim countries and “zero tolerance” family separation, as well as on possible ethical misconduct throughout the administration or the Trump family’s private businesses. White House officials defended Trump’s lack of preparation by saying he is focused squarely on helping Republicans preserve their majorities in the Nov. 6 midterm elections rather than, in the words of one senior official, “panicking about something that could happen.” Any Democratic salvos would not happen until new members take office in January, which Trump advisers said seems like eons away in an administration juggling so many immediate problems. As a result, preparing for possible impeachment proceedings is not at the top of Trump’s to-do list. “I don’t know if he’s really thought about it in depth yet,” Giuliani said. One source of growing anxiety among Trump allies is the worry that the president and some senior White House officials are not anxious enough. Although Trump sometimes talks about impeachment with his advisers, in other moments, he gets mad that “the i-word,” as he calls it, is raised, according to his associates. “Winter is coming,” said one Trump ally in close communication with the White House. “Assuming Democrats win the House, which we all believe is a very strong likelihood, the White House will be under siege. But it’s like tumbleweeds rolling down the halls over there. Nobody’s prepared for war.” Trump has told confidants that some of his aides have highly competent lawyers such as Lowell, who represents Kushner, and William A. Burck, who represents McGahn as well as former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. “He wonders why he doesn’t have lawyers like that,” said one person who has discussed the matter with Trump. Another adviser said Trump remarked this year, “I need a lawyer like Abbe.” Giuliani said that he has not heard of Trump considering adding Lowell to the team but that he would be a great choice because of his thorough and aggressive style. “This president might like that better,” Giuliani said. “If he thinks someone isn’t being tough enough, he has a tendency to go out to defend himself. And that’s not good.” Lowell declined to comment, and people familiar with the talks said it was unclear whether he would have the time for or interest in working for Trump, considering that he already represents Kushner. Mark Corallo, a former spokesman for Trump’s legal team, recommended that the president hire lawyers who are “real scholars of the Constitution” and who are well versed in history’s impeachment proceedings for Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson. “I would think that the type of lawyer most able to handle the impeachment scenario would be someone from the appellate and Supreme Court bar — someone of the Ted Olson or Paul Clement or Andy Pincus level, someone who knows how to make the kind of arguments should it come to a vote in the Senate,” Corallo said. Emmet Flood, a White House lawyer and McGahn ally who handles the special counsel’s Russia investigation, has long been considered a top prospect to replace McGahn. People close to Flood said that if Trump offers him the counsel’s job, he would have to evaluate how best he could continue his priority of serving as the White House’s chief strategist with the Mueller probe. Flood, often described as a lawyer’s lawyer, is in many ways the opposite of Trump and Giuliani, yet the president has told advisers he is impressed by Flood’s legal chops and hard-line positions defending the prerogatives of the White House. “The next White House counsel needs to be prepared for a lot of interactions on the Hill,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). “If the Democrats do take back the House, you can expect the White House counsel to be center stage in answering subpoenas and really in the middle of it all.” White House officials said Trump is working hard on the campaign trail to prevent Democrats from winning a majority in either the House or the Senate. “We don’t expect Democrats to take over,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. “Democrats have no message other than to attack the president. . . . If they want to go backwards, they can vote for Democrats. If they want to continue moving forward under President Trump, they should vote for people that support his policies.” White House aides, including deputy chief of staff Johnny ­DeStefano and political director Bill Stepien, have tried to ratchet down Trump’s expectations for the elections, saying that projections look grim in the House. Some of Trump’s advisers, including recently departed White House legislative affairs director Marc Short, have said that Democrats winning the House could help the president’s reelection chances in 2020 if they overplay their hand going after Trump, as Republicans did in Clinton’s second term. Trump has so far not accepted that argument, often saying that Republicans are going to keep the House, according to people familiar with the talks. Many Trump associates inside and outside the government say the opposite. They warn that a Democratic House majority could all but paralyze the White House with investigations, requests for documents and calls to testify on any number of issues, including Trump’s businesses. One adviser recalled recently telling Trump, “They will crush you if they win. You don’t want them investigating every single thing you’ve done.” Another concern is that the White House, which already has struggled in attracting top-caliber talent to staff positions, could face an exodus if Democrats take over the House, because aides fear their mere proximity to the president could place them in legal limbo and possibly result in hefty lawyers’ fees. “It stops good people from potentially serving because nobody wants to inherit a $400,000 legal bill,” said another Trump adviser. Trump allies privately worry that the West Wing staff is barely equipped to handle basic crisis communications functions, such as distributing robust talking points to key surrogates, and question how the operation could handle an impeachment trial or other potential battles. Trump sees the administration as having a singular focus — him — and therefore is less concerned with the institution of the presidency and not aware of the vast infrastructure often required to protect it, according to some of his allies. During the impeachment proceedings against Clinton, the White House staffed a robust war room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building that included scores of lawyers, as well as communications staffers and other strategists. Jack Quinn, who served as White House counsel under Clinton, said his office had at least 40 lawyers and as many as 60 during key times. He estimated that he spent between half and three-quarters of his time dealing with investigations. “I appreciate that Rudy Giuliani is doing a lot of the public speaking and perhaps some other things,” Quinn said. But, he added, “it’s a little bit of a mystery to me who is doing the outside legal work.” “The president needs to have the very best lawyers he can get both in the White House and outside representing him personally,” Quinn said. Trump allies lament that the current administration has no such infrastructure and fret that there are no indications it is building one. “What he really has to get ready for is an onslaught from all of these committees,” Giuliani said of congressional inquiries. “Because what the Democrats want is death by a thousand cuts.” Rosalind S.

At the time, I was stunned by a terrible tragedy: the crash of a plane that had carried the Polish president, Lech Kaczynski. He had been flying to the Russian city of Smolensk to visit the memorial at Katyn, where Stalin murdered 20,000 Polish officers in 1940. Several dozen senior military figures and politicians were also on the plane, many of them friends of mine and colleagues of my husband, who was then the Polish foreign minister. Among them was his deputy, Andrzej Kremer, a wonderful man and brilliant diplomat. In the sweep of emotion that followed the crash, comparing the event to Katyn, I wrote this sentence: “This time around, nobody suspects a conspiracy.” As an excuse, I offer the fact that the tragedy initially seemed to bring people together. Politicians of all parties, from right to left, had been on the plane. Widely attended funerals were held across the country. Even Vladimir Putin, then the Russian prime minister, seemed moved. He arranged for the broadcast of “Katyn” — an emotional and very anti-Soviet Polish film — on Russian state television as a kind of memorial. Nothing like it has ever been shown so widely in Russia, before or since. But my optimism was premature. The president’s brother, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, then the unpopular leader of the parliamentary opposition, seems to have initially believed, as all the evidence has always shown, that the crash was an accident. Then he changed his mind. Perhaps he could not accept that his beloved twin had died randomly, in a pointless crash. Perhaps he was maddened by grief. Perhaps he felt guilty: He had helped plan the trip. Or perhaps, like Donald Trump, he saw that a conspiracy theory could help bring him to power. Much as Trump used birtherism to inspire his core voters, Kaczynski, in the years that followed, used the Smolensk crash to motivate his supporters, that minority of the Polish population that remains convinced that unnamed secret forces control the country, that the “elite” is manipulated by foreigners and that everything that has happened in the country since 1989 is part of a sinister plot. And it worked. Last year, thanks to flukes of the electoral system, less than 40 percent of the vote — reflecting 18 percent of the adult population — proved sufficient for his nationalist-populist party, Law and Justice, to win a slim parliamentary majority. Readers familiar with my recent op-eds will know that I am not shy about pointing out Russian plots when I see them. But there is just no evidence of one at Smolensk. Within hours of the crash, Polish forensic experts were on the ground. They immediately obtained the black boxes and transcribed them meticulously. The cockpit tape can be heard online, and it makes the circumstances painfully clear. The president was late; he had planned a live broadcast from Katyn. When Russian air traffic controllers wanted to divert the plane because of heavy fog, he did not agree. The chief of the air force sat in the cockpit during the final minutes of the flight and pushed the pilots to land: “Be bold, you’ll make it,” he told them. According to the official report, written by the country’s top aviation experts, the plane hit a tree, then the ground, and then broke up. In the wake of Trump’s grudging renouncement of birtherism, the insidious, racist theory that gave rise to his political career, it’s worth pondering what happened when Law and Justice came to power. Within days of taking office, the new government removed the official report from its website. (It’s still available online.) More recently, police and prosecutors entered the homes of the aviation experts who testified in the original investigation, interrogated them and confiscated their computers. A new (and well-paid) government commission was formed, containing a group of cranks and “experts” — including an ethnomusicologist, a retired pilot, a psychologist and other people with no knowledge of air crashes. The defense minister, Antoni Macierewicz, who is obsessed with conspiracies of all kinds — famously, he has given credence to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an infamous, Czarist-era anti-Semitic forgery — has floated multiple theories, many of which contradict one another. Sometimes the previous Polish government is blamed, sometimes Putin. Sometimes there has been an explosion, sometimes a deliberate controller error. Sometimes “the government,” which was of a different party than the president, is said to have sabotaged a trip that in fact was prepared by the president’s office. None of these theories has ever been accompanied by the slightest hint of genuine evidence. Because they have been unable to disprove the original report, the ruling party instead ordered the creation of a fake version of reality in the form of a film. “Smolensk” came out two weeks ago and purports to show the “true story” of the crash and the “coverup.” The conclusion — it involves an onboard explosion — is so preposterous that some viewers have howled with laughter. Nevertheless, the film has been declared “true” by Kaczynski, and the education minister has suggested that schoolchildren ought to see it. As in communist Poland, a fictionalized version of history, one that suits those in power, could eventually be on the curriculum. In due course, there may be other consequences. One of the first things Law and Justice officials did upon taking power was launch an open attack on Poland’s constitutional court, and to re-politicize the independent prosecutor’s office. At the same time, they have put all of the country’s secret services in the hands of a man who has been convicted of fabricating documents, and whom they then pardoned. They might have had many motives for making these changes. But if nothing else, they could use these tools to “prove” one of the ludicrous theories using faked evidence at public show trials, another communist innovation. That kind of drama might satisfy Kaczynski emotionally; he might also reckon it would help him politically. I realize that there is far more detail here about Poland than most non-Polish readers care to know. But I’m offering it for a reason. Trump, like Kaczynski, pushed a patently false conspiracy theory hard for many years, despite the utter lack of evidence. Last week, he found it expedient to discard that theory, but once he is president, he might find it expedient to adopt it again — or perhaps to push one of the many others he has championed. As president, he can then use the state — the Justice Department, the security bureaucracy, the FBI — to pursue them. A Trump administration could make birtherism the excuse for fake investigations, hearings and even trials that would do terrible and irreversible damage to U.S. politics and the rule of law. It all sounds unthinkable, of course. But if you’d asked me five years ago, or even one year ago, I would have told you that the transformation of the Smolensk conspiracy theory into state ideology was unthinkable, too. And yet it has come to pass. Read more from Anne Applebaum’s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old The U.S. Constitution, as written by the framers, contains seven articles. President Trump’s version goes to 12. Trump informed lawmakers of his “Spinal Tap” approach to constitutional law three years ago, but current events make it more ominous in the retelling. Asked what he would do to protect the Constitution’s Article I powers — the powers of Congress — he reportedly responded, “I want to protect Article I, Article II, Article XII.” We now know he had no intention of protecting Article I, and we have a good idea what must be in those five unwritten articles that exist only in the president’s imagination: Article VIII gives Trump the power to solicit and receive the help of foreign governments in his election. Article IX gives Trump the power to ignore congressional subpoenas and to block witnesses from testifying. (Trump’s latest exercise of Article IX powers came Monday; George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, failed to show up for a deposition before three House committees.) Article X gives Attorney General William P. Barr the power to reach out directly to foreign leaders and intelligence services — without involving the FBI or the Justice Department’s international personnel — to solicit information that could help Trump’s reelection. Article XI exempts Trump from turning over his tax returns, no matter how many laws or court orders say otherwise. (A federal judge became the third to rule against Trump in the matter on Monday, condemning Trump’s “categorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity from judicial process.”) And Article XII gives Trump the power to impose extralegal punishments, including the impeachment of Congress. Trump appeared to be exercising these Article XII powers on Saturday when he said that Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) is a “pompous ‘ass’ ” who should be impeached. (Romney had criticized Trump actions as “wrong and appalling.”) The (real) Constitution does not provide for impeaching lawmakers, but Trump on Sunday expanded his extra-constitutional demand, saying “Nervous Nancy” Pelosi and “Liddle’ Adam Schiff” were guilty of “Treason” and must be “immediately impeached.” It’s a variant of Trump’s “No puppet, you’re the puppet” defense. You can’t impeach me — I impeach you! Fighting impeachment, Trump employs two familiar arguments. One is to accuse his opponents of whatever he’s accused of. The other is to blurt out obscenities. Before branding Romney an “ass,” Trump informed 65 million Twitter followers that the Democrats’ case is “BULLSHIT.” (Objectively accurate headline: “Trump Tweets Bullshit.”) It hardly matters that Trump’s new plan to impeach his accusers is not, technically, legal. As during the Russia inquiry, ignorance of the law might be his best (and perhaps only) defense. The ignorance seems genuine: In addition to developing a 12-article Constitution, Trump has mused about attacking migrants with bayonets and alligators, “ordered” U.S. businesses to find alternatives to China, proposed to rewrite a constitutional citizenship provision by fiat and routinely accused those who criticize him of “treason.” Trump, also calling his critics “spies,” recently pined for the “old days when we were smart with spies and treason” and “we used to handle it a little differently.” Ah, yes, the good old days, when those accused of treason were summarily shot. Perhaps he’ll also use his Article XII powers to bring back the halcyon days of cruel and unusual punishment; he could order that Romney be given 30 stripes, send Pelosi to the ducking stool and crop Schiff’s ears. Even if he did, it’s a safe bet Republicans would respond as they are now: by looking the other way or by insisting Trump was just joking. Only unelected Republicans seem to notice how awful they look excusing this behavior. Colin Powell says the GOP “has got to get a grip on itself.” Kerry Kircher, House counsel for the Republicans between 2011 and 2016, told The Post’s Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade that Trump “is shaking the foundations of the republic.” Even Trump loyalist Tucker Carlson wrote of Trump’s Ukraine call: “Some Republicans are trying, but there’s no way to spin this as a good idea.” So what can Democrats do about it? They could always take an article from Trump’s unwritten constitution, and assert their newfound powers to brand the letter “R” (for rogue) on Trump’s cheek, to chain Barr to the whipping post or to sentence uncooperative witnesses to bilboes and pillories. But Democrats don’t have to follow Trump into the constitutional wilderness. In the “old days,” Congress’s inherent contempt powers allowed lawmakers to impose fines and to detain those who ignored subpoenas. Trump’s extra-constitutional antics have set off court battles that will, by design, outlast any impeachment inquiry. In the meantime, Democrats would be justified reviving a practice that is both legal and proportional when administration witnesses refuse to testify. Lock ’em up.

        "articles": "Preet Bharara, a scholar in residence at New York University Law School, was U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 until this March. The most dramatic hearing I helped to arrange as chief counsel to a Senate subcommittee took place 10 years ago Monday, when James B. Comey, then deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, described how he and FBI Director Robert Mueller intervened at the hospital bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft. The encounter occurred in 2004, after White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. and White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales tried to overrule Comey’s and Mueller’s legal objection to a secret terrorist surveillance program. When the White House nonetheless sought the ailing Ashcroft’s blessing to proceed, Comey prepared to resign. Ultimately, Comey and Mueller prevailed. Jim Comey was once my boss and remains my friend. I know that many people are mad at him. He has at different times become a cause for people’s frustration and anger on both sides of the aisle. Some of those people may have a point. But on this unsettling anniversary of that testimony, I am proud to know a man who had the courage to say no to a president. And in the tumult of this time, the question whose answer we should perhaps fear the most is the one evoked by that showdown: Are there still public servants who are prepared to say no to the president? Now, as the country once again wonders whether justice can be nonpolitical and whether its leaders understand the most basic principles of prosecutorial independence and the rule of law, I recall yet another firestorm that erupted 10 years ago over the abrupt and poorly explained firing of top Justice Department officials in the midst of sensitive investigations. The 2007 affair was not Watergate, the more popular parallel invoked lately, but the lessons of that spring, after the Bush administration inexplicably fired more than eight of its own U.S. attorneys, are worth recalling. When the actions became public, people suspected political interference and obstruction. Democrats were the most vocal, but some Republicans asked questions, too. The uproar intensified as it became clear that the initial explanations were mere pretext, and the White House couldn’t keep its story straight. Public confidence ebbed, and Congress began to investigate. In response, the Senate launched a bipartisan (yes, bipartisan) investigation into those firings and the politicization of the Justice Department. Early on, the then-deputy attorney general — Comey was gone by then — looked senators in the eye and said the U.S. attorneys were fired for cause; although such appointees certainly serve at will, this assertion turned out to be demonstrably false. We learned that the U.S. attorney in New Mexico, David C. Iglesias, was fired soon after receiving an improper call from Republican Sen. Pete V. Domenici pushing him to bring political corruption cases before the election. We learned that Justice Department officials in Washington had improperly applied a conservative ideological litmus test to attorneys seeking career positions, to immigration judges and even to the hiring of interns. Ultimately, amid the drumbeat of revelations, every top leader of the department stepped down under a cloud. Finally, Gonzales himself resigned. Strict protocols were put in place severely limiting White House contacts with Justice officials on criminal matters. The blow to the morale and reputation of the department was incalculable. For me, the past week has been deja vu all over again. To restore faith in the rule of law, three obvious things must happen: First, we need a truly bipartisan investigation in Congress. That means no partisan nonsense — just a commitment to finding the facts, whatever they may be, proving (or disproving) Russian interference in our election and anything related. Congress is a check and a balance, and never more important than when a bullying chief executive used to his own way seems not to remember the co-equal status of the other two branches. Second, the new FBI director must be apolitical and sensitive to the law-enforcement mission, not someone with a long record of reflexive partisanship or commentary on the very investigative issues that will come before the bureau. Unfortunately, some of the candidates paraded by cameras this past weekend reality-show style fall into that category. I can’t think of anything worse for FBI morale, for truth-finding or for public trust. More than ever the FBI needs a strong and stabilizing hand, which means somebody who has not spent most of his or her career pandering for votes, groveling for cash or putting party over principle. Finally, I join in the common-sense call for an independent and uncompromised special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation. Given the manner of Comey’s firing and the pretextual reasons proffered for it, there is no other way. My former colleague, now-Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, is a respected career prosecutor but has mostly deserved the doubts he generated with his peculiar press-release-style memo purporting to explain Comey’s sudden sacking. He can still fix it. The move would not only ensure the independence of the investigation, but also provide evidence of Rosenstein’s own independence. History will judge this moment. It’s not too late to get it right, and justice demands it. Read more here: The Post’s View: The FBI must be protected — from the White House Laurence H. Tribe: Trump must be impeached. Here’s why.

        "articles": "Let’s not mince words: Donald Trump is a bigot and a racist. Some will think this an outrageous label to apply to the frontrunner for a major party’s presidential nomination. Ordinarily, I would agree that name-calling is part of what’s wrong with our politics. But there is a greater imperative not to be silent in the face of demagoguery. Trump in this campaign has gone after African Americans, immigrants, Latinos, Asians, women, Muslims and now the disabled. His pattern brings to mind the famous words of Martin Neimoller, the pastor and concentration camp survivor (“First they came for the socialists…”) that Ohio Gov. John Kasich adroitly used in a video last week attacking Trump’s hateful broadsides. It might be possible to explain away any one of Trump’s outrages as a mistake or a misunderstanding. But at some point you’re not merely saying things that could be construed as bigoted: You are a bigot. It has been more than a quarter century since Trump took out ads in New York newspapers calling for the death penalty for “criminals of every age” after five black and Latino teens were implicated in the Central Park jogger case. The young men, convicted and imprisoned, were later cleared by DNA evidence and the confession of a serial rapist – and Trump called their wrongful-conviction settlement a “disgrace.” [How Trump courted the right-wing fringe to conquer the GOP] Since then, Trump led the “birther” movement challenging President Obama’s standing as a natural-born American; used various vulgar expressions to refer to women; spoke of Mexico sending rapists and other criminals across the border; called for rounding up and deporting 11 million illegal immigrants; had high-profile spats with prominent Latino journalists and news outlets; mocked Asian accents; let stand a charge made in his presence that Obama is a Muslim and that Muslims are a “problem” in America; embraced the notion of forcing Muslims to register in a database; falsely claimed thousands of Muslims celebrated the 9/11 attacks in New Jersey; tweeted bogus statistics asserting that most killings of whites are done by blacks; approved of the roughing up of a black demonstrator at one of his events; and publicly mocked the movements of New York Times (and former Washington Post) journalist Serge Kovaleski, who has a chronic condition limiting mobility. He hasn’t gone after Jews recently, but his backers have, and Trump was uncharacteristically silent when prominent booster Ann Coulter, responding to Republican candidates’ support for Israel in a debate, tweeted: “How many f---ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?” Though all Trump supporters surely aren’t racists or bigots, even a cursory examination of social media reveals that many are. Those supporting Trump tend to be white, less-educated and middle-aged and older – those who are anxious and angry because they are losing ground as the American economy changes. An analysis of the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll by my colleague Scott Clement found that Trump, who has the support of 14 percent of registered voters overall, does particularly well among white men who aren’t college-educated (24 percent) and white, non-evangelical Protestants (27 percent), but gets only 3 percent of non-whites and 5 percent of those under 30 years old. [Greg Sargent: Trump’s demagoguery just got even uglier] This doesn’t mean Republicans or conservatives generally are bigoted. I wouldn’t label any other candidate in the GOP field that way (though Carson’s remarks disqualifying Muslims from the presidency crossed the line) and Trump, though leading in the polls, lacks the support of most. Thirty-two percent of Republicans supported Trump in the latest Post poll, which means 86 percent of the overall American electorate hasn’t embraced him. Trump’s rivals for the nomination are slowly and haltingly finding the courage to call the man what he is. Chris Christie on Monday criticized Trump’s treatment of Kovaleski. John Kasich, after last week’s Neimoller video, issued an ad Monday showing Trump’s mockery of Kovaleski’s disability and saying Trump isn’t “worthy” of the presidency. Some Trump defenders claim the candidate isn’t racist but simply “careless and undisciplined,” as John Hinderaker of the conservative website PowerLine put it. When I called in last week to a radio show Hinderaker hosted, he defended the treatment of the black man at Trump’s rally (“he was obviously being disruptive and he was a big burly guy”), Trump’s tweet falsely blaming African Americans for most killings of white people (“he just fell for some bad data”) and Trump’s embrace of a Muslim database (“that was brought up by a reporter”). I argued that the large number of instances over an extended period add up to a pattern of bigotry. “We’d be at it a long time if we go back through history,” the host said. Exactly. Shouldn’t Republicans take that time before they nominate a racist? Twitter: @Milbank Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

        "articles": "Never accuse Republicans of being uncreative. Once again, they've found an innovative way to punish the poor and simultaneously increase budget deficits — all with one nifty trick! To pull off this impressive twofer, they would put every American applying for the earned-income tax credit (EITC) through a sort of mini-audit before getting their refund. This would both place huge new burdens on the working poor and divert scarce Internal Revenue Service resources away from other audit targets, such as big corporations, that offer a much higher return on investment. For those not familiar, the EITC is basically a way to top up low- and moderate-income people’s pay through a tax refund, to give them a bigger payoff from working. The EITC has an excellent track record both economically and politically. Lots of studies have found that it increases workforce participation, for example. Since its introduction in 1975, it has also received bipartisan support, given its dual purpose as both an anti-poverty and a pro-work program. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have overseen major EITC expansions. Thanks to a combination of innocent mistakes and outright fraud, though, some EITC money is disbursed erroneously. And so in 2015 Congress passed a bipartisan law to improve the program's integrity. The changes that went into effect this year include a several-week delay in issuing EITC refunds so the IRS can match basic documents such as W-2s and 1099s to tax filers' reported income. The IRS hasn't yet analyzed the full effect of these changes, though early numbers look promising. Before the full results are in, however, House Republicans have decided to do something far more drastic. Sometime in the next few weeks, the House is expected to vote on the fiscal 2018 budget resolution, a procedural step that's designed to pave the way for tax cuts. That's gotten a fair amount of coverage, of course. Less publicized is troubling language in the budget resolution committee report, which proposes decreasing \"improper\" EITC payments by requiring verification of all income before benefits go out. The language is vague but appears to refer to a Heritage Foundation proposal that would require the IRS to \"fully verify income through a review of Form W-2, Form 1099, business licensing or registration, and relevant invoices\" before dispensing any refunds. So, a mini-audit. As noted in a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, conducting mini-audits of all 28 million EITC claimants would be an astonishingly laborious task, both for tax filers and for the IRS. It would impose huge administrative burdens on low-income workers, many of whom cobble together a living through multiple jobs and part-time “gig economy” positions, from which they may not earn enough money to require a 1099. At a time when Republicans are flogging tax simplification, this would make tax preparation infinitely more complicated. Unless, of course, the goal is to discourage poor people from applying for the EITC in the first place. Even for those who persisted in applying for the refund, EITC payments might be delayed for many months, causing great hardship. The vast majority of recipients use their refund checks for rent, utilities, mortgage payments and other necessities, as well as to pay down debt. But the proposal is more than just cruel. It’s also likely to cost the government a lot of money. Recall that Republicans have been steadily cutting the IRS's budget, which is a silly thing to do if you're truly a fiscal conservative who believes in \"law and order.\" The IRS brings in far more money than it receives, particularly in its work going after tax cheats. And cutting the IRS budget is an especially silly thing to do if you’re also giving the agency an enormous new mandate likely to crowd out other enforcement activities — including those that bring in much bigger paydays. The amounts at stake in EITC audits are relatively small. Overclaim errors are often just a few hundred dollars, compared with the hundreds of thousands or even millions that can be recovered from deep-pocketed corporations and individuals. Arguably the IRS already devotes too many resources to these small-potatoes cases; EITC audits represent about 39 percent of all individual income-tax audits, despite accounting for just 7 percent of additional taxes that audits find to be owed. If Republicans actually cared about reducing EITC tax cheating, there are more effective and compassionate things they could pursue, such as regulating the fly-by-night unlicensed tax preparers responsible for a disproportionate share of EITC fraud. Both the Trump and Obama administrations have asked Congress for authority to do this, to no avail. President Trump said he’d help America win again. He can start by persuading his fellow Republicans to ditch this lose-lose proposition.

        "articles": "Here is perhaps the most important medical and political fact of our time: 99.5 percent of all covid-19-related deaths in the United States occur among unvaccinated people; 0.5 percent of covid deaths occur among vaccinated people. If you tell people not to be vaccinated, you add to the former category. In this light, the recent outbreak of applause at the Conservative Political Action Conference for the United States’ failure to meet its vaccination target was macabre. Here were political activists — many of whom would call themselves “pro-life” — cheering for the advance of death. How did we get to such a strange, desperate place? I don’t want to discount the possibility that some people are just badly misinformed. They think the vaccines come with itsy-bitsy tracking chips, or make you magnetic, or render you infertile — all of which are pure rubbish. Ignorance is a form of moral mitigation, but it is still, well, ignorance. There are also some who oppose vaccination out of a tragically misapplied libertarianism. They somehow think the defense of freedom requires the rejection of sound medical advice from the government. They seek a rarefied form of liberation — liberation from rational rules, from prudent precautions, from scientific reality and from moral responsibility for their neighbors’ well-being. This is the degraded version of a proud tradition: Live free and let someone else die. But others in conservative media and elected office must know precisely what they’re doing. They’re rational enough to recognize the timeline the rest of us inhabit, on which we desperately needed miraculous vaccines, miraculously got them and expeditiously distributed them to the willing. In the case of Fox News celebrities in particular, they must know that discouraging vaccination — by exaggerating risks, highlighting unproven alternative therapies and normalizing anti-vaccine voices — will result in additional, unnecessary deaths. This is hard to get my head around. If someone were to pay me as a columnist to argue that cigarette smoking is healthy for children, or to encourage teenagers to take naps on railroad tracks after underage drinking, I don’t think I could make an ethical case for accepting the deal. Should it matter if I belonged to a news network where producing child smokers and trisected teens were institutional policies? Or if one-half of a major political party endorsed such goals? I don’t see why. Fox News’s conservative anti-vaxxers gain advantages — in viewers and influence — by feeding conspiratorial fears that can kill their viewers. Standing outside politics for a moment, is this really the sum of their ambitions? Is this a reason to get out of bed in the morning? How does someone look in the mirror and say: Today, I will purposely misinform people in ways that increase their risk of hospitalization and death? But the largest betrayal comes from Republican politicians who feed vaccine skepticism for their own benefit. It is my predisposition to sympathize with the difficult work of legislators. They are often forced to weigh competing goods in matters of grave consequence. They are sometimes forced to decide whether they will support or oppose putting our armed forces at risk. This case, however, is very different. No one has forced Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.), Ron Johnson (Wis.), or Ted Cruz (Tex.), Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) or Madison Cawthorn (N.C.), or many of their Republican peers to encourage vaccine skepticism, or to slander vaccine promotion as oppression, or to make selfish, destructive health decisions into a new civic rights cause. Yet they have. They are not proposing a realistic, alternative way to defeat a pandemic. They are undermining the only way to defeat a pandemic, because it will endear them to Trump stalwarts. This is not just the sacrifice of conscience for political reasons. It is the sacrifice of citizens. The health education provided by Republican officials to their supporters has been tragically effective. According to a recent Post-ABC News poll, 86 percent of Democrats have received at least one vaccine dose, while only 45 percent of Republicans have done so. This has put a vast number of additional Republicans in what West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) calls the “death lottery.” For years, I’ve been saying to myself that GOP politics can’t go lower. I am perpetually wrong. Americans should never forget this moment — or let guilty Republicans forget it. When Republican activists cheered for death at CPAC, they were cheering for disproportionately Republican deaths. When elected Republicans feed doubts about safe, effective vaccines, they are making it more physically dangerous to be a Republican in America. And how do we know this? Because 99.5 percent of all covid-19-related deaths in the United States occur among unvaccinated people; 0.5 percent of covid deaths occur among vaccinated people. If you tell people not to be vaccinated, you add to the former category.

        "articles": "“Frank [Luntz] has been a friend of mine for more than 30 years. … I’ve rented a room from Frank for a couple of months, but don’t worry, I’m back to — going back to where I normally am, on my couch in my office. But, yes, we pay fair market rate.” — House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), in an interview on “Fox & Friends,” May 4 Last week, The Fact Checker revealed that the “room” that McCarthy rented from prominent pollster Frank Luntz for at least two months was in a 7,000-square-foot space — a combination of four penthouse apartments. It turns out that the bylaws of the condo building, Clara Barton at Penn Quarter, specifically prohibit condo owners from renting anything less than the entire space — and for not less than six months. “No portion of any Unit (other than the entire Unit) shall be leased for any period,” the bylaws say. “No Unit within the Buildings shall be rented for transient or hotel purposes … No lease shall be for a term of less than six months.” The bylaws also specify that “all leases shall be in writing” and say that all leases must be promptly forwarded to the building’s board of directors. The bylaws are referenced in the deed of sale for one of the units purchased by Luntz, which notes that it is “delivered and accepted subject to all the provisions of … the Condominium Bylaws.” Luntz did not respond to requests for comment via email, text or Twitter direct message. A spokesman for McCarthy also did not respond a request for comment. Asked whether the building was investigating whether Luntz violated the bylaws, Quiana Bennett, assistant community manager, declined to comment. “It is the policy of the Clara Barton and its management to respect the privacy of our unit owners, residents, guests, and staff,” she added. “We ask that The Washington Post extend the same courtesy to the members of our community.” The District of Columbia regulates short-term and room rentals, saying it “considers renting out a spare bedroom a business” and requires landlords who rent out a bedroom to fill out Form FR-500 with the D.C. Office of Tax Revenue, which provides the city with the location and ownership of the business. Hotel and “transient accommodations” under 90 days are subject to a 14.95 percent tax on the listing price. People who rent their apartments also need to apply for a Basic Business License with the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, said DCRA spokesman Jameel Harris. Those failing to register their spare bedroom rental as a business can be fined up to $2,000. About 90 residents at Clara Barton are listed on the DCRA website as having obtained such licenses, but Luntz is not among them. (A previous owner of one of the Luntz apartments is listed as having an expired license.) The website warns that the list may not be entirely up to date, but licenses obtained in 2021 are listed. In August and September of 2018, Luntz purchased four adjoining penthouse units in the Clara Barton building in Penn Quarter for a total of almost $4.3 million. Combined, the units totaled 6,960 square feet and had 12 bedrooms, 12 full bathrooms and four half-baths. Luntz began merging the units in November 2019, and the renovation received a final building inspection on Oct. 20. Besides the “room” he rented, McCarthy would have had access to a 24/7 concierge, a rooftop pool, a fitness center, a media room, a business center and a party room with a bar and pool table. The homeownership association fees alone on the units are $4,976 per month, according to Redfin.com. When McCarthy stayed in Luntz’s place is unclear, but it appears to have been after the renovation was completed, possibly early in 2021. On May 4, McCarthy told “Fox & Friends” that he rented the room “as the Democrats took over; they started changing the House around.” Democrats took control of the House in January 2019, and Biden assumed the presidency in January of this year. But an unnamed McCarthy spokesman had told Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, who first reported on the living arrangement, that “because of the pandemic, McCarthy has rented a room in Washington at a fair market price from Frank.” In a November 2020 interview, Luntz noted that he happened to be in Washington at the time but that he lived in Los Angeles. McCarthy has often highlighted how he lives sparsely in Washington, sleeping on a couch in his office. “Don’t worry, I’m back to — I’m going back to where I normally are, on my couch in my office,” he added during the Fox interview. At one point in the interview, he described the rental period as a “few months.” An unnamed McCarthy spokesman told the Daily Wire: “McCarthy rented a room of approximately 400 square feet, and under House Ethics guidelines, calculated the fair market amount at $1,500/month by comparing what other members of Congress were also paying to live in the building and additional comparables for the space in the building and neighborhood.” Zillow currently lists studios and one-bedrooms in the Clara Barton building as between $1,675 and $2,300 a month. The Campaign for Accountability, a nonpartisan watchdog organization, has asked the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate the McCarthy-Luntz arrangement. The group noted that members of Congress generally are prohibited from accepting gifts, including lodging, and that the rent appeared to be below market rate. The group said that would qualify as a gift. Although allowances are made for gifts based on personal friendship, accepting a gift valued above $250 requires permission from the House Ethics Committee. If McCarthy was required to pay 14.95 percent tax on two month’s rent ($3,000) and Luntz did not collect it, that might be considered a gift of $448.50. But Natalie Wilson of the DC Office of Tax and Revenue said that “because the statute specifically limits taxable transactions to those involving hotels or other ‘accommodations [that] are regularly furnished to transients for a consideration’, a short term lease would likely not be subject to sales tax.” She added that if a landlord collected more than $12,000 in rent for a lease in a calendar year, she/he would be required to file and pay the unincorporated business tax on the rental income.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old If there really is going to be a “blue wave” this November, the result will be not just Democrats potentially taking control of one or both houses of Congress, but Democratic gains in state legislatures as well. And if Democrats find themselves in a stronger position at the state level, they’ll have an opportunity to move the country in a dramatically more progressive direction. In order to take full advantage of that opportunity — the way Republicans have in recent years — they have to not just win seats and control of chambers, they also have to know what they want to do with them. And this, to be frank, is something Democrats haven’t been all that great at articulating, at least not in an organized way that makes for a common agenda being implemented in multiple places at once. Which is why the Center for American Progress, the most prominent Democrat-aligned think tank, released a report on Thursday entitled “Bold Ideas for State Action.” The report, which I got a look at before its release, is meant to provide a menu of policies that state legislators can pursue. If nothing else, documents such as this remind us that the complaint that the Democratic apparatus doesn’t have an agenda, or is too focused on being anti-Trump, is completely bogus. Indeed, you’ve probably heard these kinds of proposals from Democrats many times before. To be clear, that’s not a bad thing; it shows the party has consistent beliefs and ideas about how to put those ideas into action. They have 11 different policy areas, but I’ll outline just a few to give you a flavor of their proposals, all of which concern potential state-level action: If you were a Democrat running for state representative somewhere, this could be valuable, since it seems pitched at about the level of detail usually demanded of candidates: meaty enough to offer some specifics if they’re pressed, but not so deep into the policy weeds that voters wouldn’t be able to follow along. In fact, any Democratic candidate could probably take these pages, copy and paste them into the “Issues” section of their website, and they’d be all set. That may be more useful than it appears. It is important to realize that, even though state legislative races are getting more expensive and more nationalized, your average state representative doesn’t have a lot resources to analyze problems and devise creative solutions. In some places, the job is part-time, they have small staffs, and a lot of our collective policy energy is expended at the national level. And action on the state level may be an important way to move in a progressive direction in the near future. Even if Democrats have a terrific election in November, they’ll have to wait for at least two years before they can actually put any of their ideas into action in Washington. They may be able to hamstring the Trump administration, but they won’t be able to see things like a higher minimum wage or health-care reforms passed into law at the national level. In the meantime, policy will be made in the states, with dramatic consequences for Americans’ lives. Here’s some new data from the Gallup-Sharecare Well Being Index that drives this point home. It finds that the uninsured rate is actually rising in 17 states: If Republicans in state governments get their way, the number of uninsured will continue to rise, particularly among the most vulnerable populations. The Trump administration is encouraging states to impose work requirements on Medicaid, which are designed to force recipients to navigate a bureaucratic maze and provide justification for throwing as many people off the program as possible. But the decision to do it happens state by state. And if Democrats can regain some ground on the state level, they can do more to prevent such policies, or even in some cases try to get states that haven’t yet done so to opt into the Medicaid expansion. Meanwhile, Democrats have been moving aggressively in a progressive direction in states they already control. The Center for American Progress report details many things that have been proposed or implemented in places such as California, Oregon, or Massachusetts over the last few years — such as increasing their minimum wages, expanding voting rights, legalizing marijuana, and passing restrictions on guns, among other things. The result is that we really are becoming two very different Americas, depending on who’s in charge in the state where you live. But Democrats still do not have their act together when it comes to fighting on the state level, at least not to the degree Republicans do. In recent years, Democrats have told themselves time and again that they need a counterpart to the American Legislative Exchange Council, the corporate-funded organization that connects and coordinates state Republican legislators to advance a unified conservative agenda across the country. Every couple of years, some Democrats create a new organization they claim is going to be their version of ALEC, but those groups never have quite the same success. Nevertheless, it sends an important signal when an influential group like the Center for American Progress puts at least some of its focus on state government. As difficult as it is to get people to look away from Washington while President Trump is in office, the states are where most of the policy action is going to be in the near future. Which is another reason the stakes in this fall’s elections are really, really high. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "Jeb Bush entered the presidential race as the “shock and awe” candidate whose fundraising dominance was poised to make his campaign an unstoppable juggernaut. He is not that candidate anymore. After reporting Thursday that he has less cash in the bank than three other Republican candidates, Bush effectively cemented his status as just another aspirant in a presidential race where the surest predictions have been proven wrong time and again. Bush — a former Florida governor who relied heavily on his family’s network to amass a $103 million war chest at his allied super PAC earlier this year — announced Thursday that he collected contributions for his actual campaign at a drastically slower pace during a difficult summer. Bush raised $13.4 million from July to September, and started October with just $10.3 million on hand after spending about $11.5 million — or 86 percent of the total over the quarter. This leaves Bush with less cash in the bank than three opponents, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), whom Bush allies see as his chief rival for GOP establishment support. Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz put a positive spin on the figures, writing Thursday in a memorandum to supporters that the campaign was financing a sprawling organization “that we are confident will deliver the Republican nomination and win the White House.” Fred Zeidman, a major Bush bundler in Houston, said he was pleased, noting that Bush had the second-biggest GOP fundraising haul of the quarter, behind retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. “I think that’s a good number, especially when you consider what he raised relative to Marco,” he said. “He has outraised everyone but the flavor of the minute. I think it’s a real good sign.” [It’s make or break time for Jeb Bush] But other top Bush supporters viewed the figure as weak considering his family’s national fundraising network, raising fresh concerns after unsteady performances on the campaign trail and polls putting him well behind front-runner Donald Trump. “He should have hit at least $25 million,” said one major Republican fundraiser, who like others interviewed requested anonymity to speak candidly. “Some donors are really nervous,” said one top Bush fundraiser. “They think they bought into a winner. . . . Donors want to see him campaign to win.” Senior members of Bush’s finance team acknowledged that the campaign has struggled to broaden its network much beyond family loyalists. “I can tap my Rolodex and my buddies can give money, but we have to have that Malcolm Gladwell ‘tipping point’ where we’re raising money from people we don’t know. We have to scale up,” said Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund manager who joined the Bush campaign after serving as national finance chairman for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s unsuccessful bid. Still, he said he was confident Bush would be the nominee. Despite a heavy onslaught of television ads in Iowa and New Hampshire by the pro-Bush super PAC, Right to Rise, his standing in public opinion surveys has remained relatively static or has even fallen. “The needle hasn’t moved an inch — and he may be worse. That’s what’s scaring folks,” said a second top Bush fundraiser. “I don’t think Jeb’s getting out of the race, but it’s certainly sinking in that he can’t revive himself just from the ads,” this person added. “He can’t buy his way back. The [poll] numbers are beginning to get hard.The candidate has to have a moment out there, and if that doesn’t happen, I just don’t know.” Right to Rise USA has spent $13 million so far on digital and television ads in early primary states promoting Bush, according to FEC filings. The group has announced plans to spend at least $23 million by the end of year, and reserved another $17 million worth of time in January and February in states like Texas and Virginia with primaries in March. Bush’s campaign also is advertising on television, putting down $500,000 on a spot in New Hampshire that knocks “D.C. politicians” and “self-promoters.” The campaign announced in September plans to reserve an additional $7.8 million in television time in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina early next year. [Updated: Inside the 2016 money race] Matthew Dowd, a strategist on former president George W. Bush’s campaigns who is unaligned in the 2016 race, said Jeb Bush is banking too much on the power of his super PAC’s advertising. “Money doesn’t create momentum; momentum creates money,” Dowd said. “We keep saying, ‘Oh, he’s got a super PAC with $100 million!’ But if you don’t have a message that resonates and if you’re not able to have momentum at the big moments, it doesn’t matter how much money you have. It’s not going to solve the problem.” Dowd added, “They’ve bet on a premise — and maybe it’s the only premise they have, because they have a flawed candidate — that advertising is going to do it, but there’s no evidence that advertising will move his numbers.” Bush campaign officials are trying to calm the nerves of supporters. A conference call with Bush donors and other supporters Thursday afternoon was described by one listener as brief, upbeat and “insistent that the plan is working.” The call included brief comments from senior adviser Sally Bradshaw, finance director Heather Larrison and top fundraisers Jack Oliver and Woody Johnson. “The message from the call was, ‘Steady as you go,’” said a second person listening on the call. The campaign officials, who took no questions, talked about upcoming fundraisers in California and Florida and said they were picking up on positive responses to Bush when voters learn about him from ads or his public events. After formally launching his campaign in June, Bush raised $11.4 million in his first two weeks, pulling in donations at the hefty rate of $760,000 a day — the fastest pace of all the 2016 contenders, according to an analysis by The Washington Post. But the pace slowed dramatically the rest of the summer. His campaign averaged just $147,000 a day in the third quarter, despite holding at least 58 fundraising events, according to news reports and invitations compiled by Sunlight’s Political Party Time. George W. Bush did at least three events, and George H.W. Bush did two. [Inside Jeb Bush’s fall strategy to deflate Trump and court conservatives] As fundraising ebbed, the Bush campaign took steps in recent months to cut back on its spending. Some staffers took pay cuts, a move first reported in late August by the New York Times and confirmed by Bush campaign officials. There has been more recent belt-tightening, too, including the candidate taking more commercial flights or driving between events and his traveling encourage staying in cheap hotels, which was reported Thursday. Rubio, despite raising only $6 million in the third quarter, began this month with nearly $11 million on hand, slightly more than Bush. In a move interpreted as taunting their rival, the Rubio campaign issued a statement Thursday boasting about its “smart budgeting and fiscal discipline” and noting that the candidate flies discount airlines such as Jet Blue and Spirit as opposed to private charter flights. Ron Kaufman, a Bush supporter and longtime friend and adviser to his father, said, “I think Jeb is not in a great place, obviously, but a good place.” Kaufman added: “There’s a long way to go, it’s a long slog, and Jeb is built for the long haul. He is not going to win right now, there’s no question about it. But in the end, I think people want someone who’s actually governed something and signed the front of a check, not just the back of a check.” Tom Hamburger and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.

        "articles": "Desktop notifications are on | Turn off Get breaking news alerts from The Washington Post Turn on desktop notifications? (Update: Stephen Colbert’s take; other details) In the you-can’t-make-up-this-stuff department, here’s what the Republican Party of Texas wrote into its 2012 platform as part of the section on education: Knowledge-Based Education – We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority. Yes, you read that right. The party opposes the teaching of “higher order thinking skills” because it believes the purpose is to challenge a student’s “fixed beliefs” and undermine “parental authority.” It opposes, among other things, early childhood education, sex education, and multicultural education, but supports “school subjects with emphasis on the Judeo-Christian principles upon which America was founded.” When taken with the other parts of the education platform(see below), it seems a fair conclusion that the GOP Party in Texas doesn’t think much of public education. Unfortunately, this notion isn’t limited to the GOP in Texas but is more commonly being seen across the country by some of the most strident of “school reformers.” It should be noted that after the plank in the platform was ridiculed, Texas GOP Communications Director Chris Elam told TPM.com that it was all a big mistake and that opposition to “critical thinking” wasn’t supposed to be included. It can’t be easily removed, he said, because the platform had been approved by a party convention and any changes would also have to go through the same process. That clears things up. You can see Stephen Colbert’s hilarious take on this episode by clicking here. It also seems worth noting that there is some question as to whether critical thinking can actually be taught. University of Virginia cognitive scientist Daniel Willingham argues that it cannot be taught in this 2007 article. First Willingham defines critical thinking this way: Critical thinking consists of seeing both sides of an issue, being open to new evidence that disconfirms your ideas, reasoning dispassionately, demanding that claims be backed by evidence, deducing and inferring conclusions from available facts, solving problems, and so forth. Then too, there are specific types of critical thinking that are characteristic of different subject matter: That’s what we mean when we refer to “thinking like a scientist” or “thinking like a historian.” Later in the article he writes: After more than 20 years of lamentation, exhortation, and little improvement, maybe it’s time to ask a fundamental question: Can critical thinking actually be taught? Decades of cognitive research point to a disappointing answer: not really. People who have sought to teach critical thinking have assumed that it is a skill, like riding a bicycle, and that, like other skills, once you learn it, you can apply it in any situation. Research from cognitive science shows that thinking is not that sort of skill. But of course, that isn’t what the Texas GOP is arguing. It sees “critical thinking” as something subversive. Scary stuff. Here’s the rest of the education section of the Texas GOP’s 2012 platform: American Identity Patriotism and Loyalty – We believe the current teaching of a multicultural curriculum is divisive. We favor strengthening our common American identity and loyalty instead of political correctness that nurtures alienation among racial and ethnic groups. Students should pledge allegiance to the American and Texas flags daily to instill patriotism. Basic Standards – We favor improving the quality of education for all students, including those with special needs. We support a return to the traditional basics of reading, writing, arithmetic, and citizenship with sufficient discipline to ensure learning and quality educational assessment. Bilingual Education – We encourage non-English speaking students to transition to English within three years. Career and Technology Education (Vocational Education) – We support reinstatement of voluntary career and technology education, including adjusting the 4x4 requirements as needed, without detracting from non-vocational program requirements. Classroom Discipline –We recommend that local school boards and classroom teachers be given more authority to deal with disciplinary problems. Corporal punishment is effective and legal in Texas. Classroom Expenditures for Staff – We support having 80% of school district payroll expenses of professional staff of a school district be full-time classroom teachers. College Tuition – We recommend three levels of college tuition: In-state requiring proof of Texas legal citizenship, out-of-state requiring proof of US citizenship, and nonresident legal alien. Non-US citizens should not be eligible for state or federal grants, or loans. Controversial Theories – We support objective teaching and equal treatment of all sides of scientific theories. We believe theories such as life origins and environmental change should be taught as challengeable scientific theories subject to change as new data is produced. Teachers and students should be able to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these theories openly and without fear of retribution or discrimination of any kind. Early Childhood Development – We believe that parents are best suited to train their children in their early development and oppose mandatory pre-school and Kindergarten. We urge Congress to repeal government-sponsored programs that deal with early childhood development. Knowledge-Based Education – We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority. Educational Entitlement – We encourage legislation that prohibits enrollment in free public schools of non-citizens unlawfully present in the United States. Funding of Education – We urge the Legislature to direct expenditures to academics as the first priority. Higher Education – We support merit-based admissions for all college and university applicants to public institutions. We further support the repeal of the 1997 Texas legislative act commonly known as the Top Ten Percent Rule. All Texas students should be given acceptance priority over out-of-state or foreign students. Juvenile Daytime Curfew - We strongly oppose Juvenile Daytime Curfews. Additionally, we oppose any official entity from detaining, questioning and/or disciplining our children without the consent of a child’s parent. Local Control for Education – We support school choice and believe that quality education is best achieved by encouraging parental involvement, protecting parental rights, and maximizing local independent school district control. District superintendents and their employees should be made solely accountable to their locally elected boards. We support sensible consolidation of local school districts. We encourage local ISDs to consider carefully the advantages and disadvantages of accepting federal education money. No Taxpayer Paid Lobbyists – We support the prohibition of any paid public school employee or contractor to lobby the legislature or the SBOE, unless on an unpaid basis and in an unofficial capacity. No registered lobbyist should be allowed to run for SBOE. Parental Rights in Education – We believe the right of parents to raise and educate their children is fundamental. Parents have the right to withdraw their child from any specialized program. We urge the Legislature to enact penalties for violation of parental rights. Sex Education – We recognize parental responsibility and authority regarding sex education. We believe that parents must be given an opportunity to review the material prior to giving their consent. We oppose any sex education other than abstinence until marriage. Parental School Choice – We encourage the Governor and the Texas Legislature to enact child-centered school funding options which fund the student, not schools or districts, to allow maximum freedom of choice in public, private, or parochial education for all children. Permanent School Fund – We believe that because the Permanent School Fund is not paid by taxpayers that the principle balance should be safeguarded and not viewed as a source of additional funding for our state budget. Political Community Organizing in Texas Schools - We believe neither Texas public schools should be used nor their students should be instructed by groups such as SEIU or other community organizers as instruments to promote political agenda during the instructional school day. Private Education – We believe that parents and legal guardians may choose to educate their children in private schools to include, but not limited to, home schools and parochial schools without government interference, through definition, regulation, accreditation, licensing, or testing. Religious Freedom in Public Schools – We urge school administrators and officials to inform Texas school students specifically of their First Amendment rights to pray and engage in religious speech, individually or in groups, on school property without government interference. We urge the Legislature to end censorship of discussion of religion in our founding documents and encourage discussing those documents. School Surveys and Testing – Public schools should be required to obtain written parental consent for student participation in any test or questionnaire that surveys beliefs, feelings, or opinions. Parental rights, including viewing course materials prior to giving consent, should not be infringed. State Board of Education (SBOE) – We believe that the SBOE should continue to be an elected body consisting of fifteen members. Their responsibilities must include: — Appointing the Commissioner of Education — Maintaining constitutional authority over the Permanent School Fund — Maintaining sole authority over all curricula content and the state adoption of all educational materials. This process must include public hearings. The SBOE should be minimally staffed out of general revenue. Textbook Review – Until such time as all texts are required to be approved by the SBOE, each ISD that uses non-SBOE approved instructional materials must verify them as factually and historically correct. Also the ISD board must hold a public hearing on such materials, protect citizen’s right of petition and require compliance with TEC and legislative intent. Local ISD boards must maintain the same standards as the SBOE. Supporting Military Families in Education – Existing truancy laws conflict with troop deployments. We believe that truancy laws should be amended to allow 5 day absence prior to deployments and R&R. Military dependents by definition will be Texas residents for education purposes. Traditional Principles in Education – We support school subjects with emphasis on the Judeo-Christian principles upon which America was founded and which form the basis of America’s legal, political and economic systems. We support curricula that are heavily weighted on original founding documents, including the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution, and Founders’ writings. School Health Care – We urge legislators to prohibit reproductive health care services, including counseling, referrals, and distribution of condoms and contraception through public schools. We support the parents’ right to choose, without penalty, which medications are administered to their minor children. We oppose medical clinics on school property except higher education and health care for students without parental consent. U.S. Department of Education – Since education is not an enumerated power of the federal government, we believe the Department of Education (DOE) should be abolished. Zero Tolerance – We believe that zero tolerance policies in schools should specify those items that will not be tolerated at schools. The policy should be posted on ISD websites. Transparency – We support legislation requiring all school districts to post their expenditures online or made readily available to the public. Foreign Culture Charter Schools in Texas – We oppose public funding of charter schools which receive money from foreign entities. We demand that these Charter Schools have accountability and transparency to local parents, taxpayers, the State of Texas, as do current public schools, including U.S. citizenship of public school trustees. -0- Follow The Answer Sheet every day by bookmarking www..com/blogs/answer-sheet.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old This is a perilous political moment for President Trump, which means that it’s time to pay a visit to the well of resentment and hatred that got him to the White House. This week, the president has promoted two stories — an imagined oppression of white farmers in South Africa and the murder of an Iowa woman named Mollie Tibbetts — that offer a vivid illustration of how he and the entire conservative movement use race-baiting to keep the Republican base in a state of agitation and anger, the better to take the focus away from issues that could weaken the standing of the president and his party. We’ll start with the Mollie Tibbetts story, which has a familiar ring to it: A young white woman allegedly murdered by an immigrant, whom the president then uses to argue for both immigration restrictions and the election of more Republicans. Here’s what Trump said at a rally this week in West Virginia: We should note that whether the suspect is actually undocumented is in dispute. And you’ll notice that, as he always does in these cases, Trump describes the victim as “beautiful,” as though her death might be less of a tragedy had she been less attractive. But how did this story get on Trump’s radar? The answer lies in the fact that Trump is not an outlier within the GOP. It’s not as though he dragged an unwilling party toward the use of race-baiting as a core political tactic. He’s only the most visible manifestation of a strategy that reaches back decades and today is on a constant hair-trigger. There’s a network of conservative media outlets and political figures always on the lookout for ways they can promote hate, fear and resentment among white people. When something like Tibbetts’ murder happens, they swing into action. Trump’s own involvement actually comes only after he has been alerted to the case by this network. So on Wednesday, the morning of that rally, Axios reported that “Former Speaker Newt Gingrich emailed Axios’ Mike Allen to make sure that we’d be covering” the Tibbetts story, which was already in heavy rotation on Fox News. Gingrich — who is more responsible than any other single figure for America’s slide into vicious, bitter partisanship over the last couple of decades — explained that “If Mollie Tibbetts is a household name by October, Democrats will be in deep trouble. If we can be blocked by Manafort-Cohen, etc., then GOP could lose [the House] badly.” In other words, the danger for Republicans is that the news media might pay too much attention to one of the largest presidential scandals in decades and not enough attention to the story of one young woman’s murder. They’re doing what they can to forestall that possibility: I searched this morning on foxnews.com for Mollie Tibbetts’ name and came back with a remarkable 192 results — 192 separate stories and videos about this case. In 2016, the last year for which we have complete data, there were 17,250 homicides in America, so Tibbetts’ murder is one of a huge number of tragic stories of violence that could draw national attention at any given moment. And as you’ve probably heard by now, we know that immigrants in general, and undocumented immigrants in particular, commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans do. But when conservatives decide immediately upon hearing about it that this is the story they want to call attention to, they aren’t doing it because of their commitment to stopping crime. They’re doing it because it gets Republicans mad — an anger that was the basis of Trump’s victory and is the foundation of the business model for Fox News and other conservative media outlets. On Wednesday, the White House tweeted out a video featuring family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, whom they say were “permanently separated” from their loved ones, a direct reference to the Trump administration’s family separation policy at the border. The linking of these isolated cases with the policy of taking children from the arms of parents seeking asylum almost seems to posit that policy as a kind of revenge taken out on immigrant families for crimes other people have committed, or at the very least setting up a ludicrous and repellent moral hierarchy: Sure, we’re traumatizing children and parents, but it’s better than killing the children, right? Now let’s turn to the second issue Trump decided to draw attention to this week: a white supremacist conspiracy theory. On Wednesday he tweeted this: Sen. Bob Corker called the tweet a “base stimulator,” and when asked what that meant, he replied, “Well, there are portions of those who support the president that are — I’m sure that generates excitement. I mean, it’s — you know what I’m saying.” Indeed we do. Where did the story come from? A pipeline of hate that pours its effluent into the Oval Office. For years, white nationalists, alt-righters, neo-Nazis and other assorted deplorables have been complaining about an alleged “white genocide” occurring in South Africa around the issue of land reform. From various Internet chat rooms, the cause was taken up by right-wing hucksters like Ann Coulter and Mike Cernovich. Then Wednesday, Tucker Carlson did a segment about it on his Fox News show, which Post media critic Erik Wemple says might be better titled “Your hour of white grievance.” Trump watched and sent out his tweet, and the result is a minor diplomatic crisis. Naturally, white nationalists are elated that Trump has taken up one of their pet causes. But they may not realize that he couldn’t care less about South African land reform. By next week he’ll have forgotten all about it, just as he’ll forget all about Mollie Tibbetts once she’s been replaced by another “beautiful” white girl whose death he can exploit for political ends. The only constant is that he’ll keep looking for new ways to keep white voters angry and afraid, in the hopes that it can save him from whatever political peril he faces. Which is why it may only get worse.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old So Britain (well, really, England and Wales), voted to leave the European Union Thursday. As the English would put it, this decision has created a small spot of bother in global financial markets and political capitals. Off the top of my head, the knock-on effects will include: Lest one think I’m overstating that last point, here’s my Post colleague Anne Applebaum Friday: It’s not just commentators making the Brexit-Trump parallel — it’s Trump himself: So let’s focus on that last point, because as one considers how Brexit might impact the 2016 election, there are three possible answers. The first and most likely one is pretty simple: It’s true, most Americans have paid zero attention to Brexit. As Spoiler Alerts has pointed out repeatedly, when it comes to elections most Americans pay zero attention to most things outside the United States. So it’s entirely probable that, four months from now, Brexit will not be a factor at all in the U.S. general election. The Brexit debate has made Britain more racist But just because Americans haven’t paid attention to Brexit until now doesn’t mean they won’t notice the effects of the Brexit vote. The second possibility is that Brexit’s effects on the global economy are pretty severe — which in turn triggers a U.S. recession. Pre-vote analysis after pre-vote analysis was pretty dour on what would happen as a result of Brexit, and Friday’s market turmoil will reinforce those analyses. Surely, financial markets will stabilize at some point, but as the Wall Street Journal’s Greg Ip notes, the new normal will not be good for global economic growth: Political Science 101 says that a weak economy hurts the incumbent party. So if U.S. economic growth continues to slow, it will be easy for voters to conclude that the system is not working and usher in President Trump. There is one last possibility, however. During this doom-and-gloom moment it seems far-fetched, but I want to put it out there just to be contrarian. The final way U.S. voters might think of Brexit is as a preview of what would happen under a President Trump. As Trump himself notes, the issues that dominated the Brexit campaign and his own campaign are similar: hostility to immigration, resentment at cosmopolitan elites, frustration with unelected officials telling ordinary citizens how to live, and a persistent perception that the status quo favors minorities layabouts over white ordinary, Anglo-Saxon decent, Christian hard-working citizens. So the question now is: What happens to Britain now that “leave” has won? Most voters never have the opportunity to know the counterfactual — what would happen if the other guy or the other idea won. On occasion, however, this happens. In September 2008, when the House of Representatives voted down the first TARP proposal, markets reacted very negatively. This response helped to ensure TARP’s passage the second time around. Brexit allows Americans to witness what Trump-like policies will produce over the next four months. If the effects are not that great, then I would agree with Bremmer and conclude that Brexit won’t matter in November. If the effects are strongly negative, however, then the Clinton campaign will have a strong incentive to tether Trump to all of the bad things happening in Britain. And Trump has just made that connection very easy for her campaign to make. So if Brexit’s negative effects over the next four months are severe, it creates some very odd dynamics. On the one hand, worsening U.S. economic prospects will benefit Trump. On the other hand, those same bad outcomes can help Clinton point out the policy disaster that a Trump administration would create. Either way, it puts U.S. politicians in the very odd and uncomfortable position of rooting against Britain’s near-term economic prospects. Welcome to electoral politics in 2016.

        "articles": "PHOENIX — If there is one place where the dramas and subplots of Campaign 2016 collide, it is across the sprawling and scorching desert state of Arizona. Here lives Donald Trump’s restive base of white voters unsettled by the country’s social transformation and fired up to dismantle Washington’s power structure. Here also lies the Democrats’ sleeping giant — an estimated 350,000 Latinos who are not registered to vote but who could mobilize against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee over his incendiary rhetoric. Then there are the politicians. One senator, Jeff Flake (R), is a vocal Trump critic sounding the alarm about an electoral wipeout. The other, John McCain (R), ­alternates awkwardly between his maverick persona and a Trump apologist as he navigates an unexpectedly difficult reelection race. Also on the ballot is Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a Trump backer whose long crusade against undocumented immigrants makes him a lightning rod. This leaves the Democrats — who have withered away as the state took a hard-right turn in the Obama era — sensing their best chance in two decades to turn Arizona and its 11 electoral votes blue. They think that Trump, who campaigned in Phoenix on Saturday, is energizing a new generation of Latino voters who haven’t participated in elections before. “Everything that needs to happen on the ground is happening,” said Fred DuVal, a longtime Democratic power broker here. There is no recent reliable public polling in Arizona, but Democratic and Republican strategists said private research shows the presidential race as a toss-up. Asked whether presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has a path to victory here, GOP strategist Charles Coughlin conceded: “I believe it’s there if she wanted to do it. Everybody always says, ‘This is the election when Latinos turn out,’ and it’s never happened. But I can actually see that happening this time.” [Trump’s candidacy sparking ‘a surge’ in citizenship, voter applications] For now, the Clinton campaign is not targeting Arizona as a battleground state; its current advertising blitz includes eight other swing states. Still, Clinton has hired Rodd McLeod, who ran former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords’s campaigns here, as state director for the general election. He is recruiting half a dozen staffers, according to local Democratic officials, while the state party’s coordinated campaign has deployed a field staff of about 70. The Clinton team is assessing trends in Arizona to determine whether to make greater investments here, and officials were cagey when asked to detail their strategy. In a statement, Marlon Marshall, the director of state campaigns and political engagement, stuck to the Clinton campaign’s national talking points: “We’re hearing real doubts from voters in Arizona about Donald Trump’s plans for a deportation force and his dangerous agenda on national security.” Clinton’s footprint appears to be greater than Trump’s. His state director, Charles Munoz, is based in Nevada, and a visit last week to Trump headquarters in Mesa revealed little evidence of an active campaign. There was one worker eating lunch at his desk, a roomful of empty cubicles and, other than a small pile of plastic yard signs, no Trump paraphernalia, brochures or fliers. The GOP’s coordinated campaign has only one staffer, though party officials boast of an active volunteer corps and plans to soon open 14 offices. The Trump campaign and Republican officials argue that carrying Arizona is pure Clinton fantasy. “Arizona will stay red,” Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham declared. “The progressive left should avoid the state of Arizona because it’s a bad investment.” At GOP headquarters here in Phoenix the other day, executive director Avinash Iragavarapu presented a slide show with data to argue his case for why putting Arizona in play is “all big talk and wishful thinking.” He pointed to the GOP’s roughly 200,000-person advantage in voter registration as well as historical patterns: In 2012, for instance, Mitt Romney defeated President Obama, 54 percent to 44 percent. Former Arizona governor Jan Brewer — considered the state’s most popular Republican and a leading Trump surrogate — said Trump resonates here because he is speaking directly to voters’ fury and anxieties. “People in Arizona like straight shooters, no pun intended, and Mr. Trump speaks the simple truth in very straightforward terms,” Brewer said. “I don’t agree with everything that he says and the way that he says it, but in my opinion, he’s a breath of fresh air.” “Everywhere I go, whether it be at malls or at Costco, people come up to me and are very, very excited about Donald Trump,” she added. But Trump is also a one-man motivator for Latinos, who make up about 30 percent of the state’s population but just 18 percent of the electorate in the last presidential election. “The climate is ripe for something to happen here. . . . When we’re out there, the name Donald Trump elicits a response, and most of the time it’s a negative one,” said Francisco Heredia, national field director of Mi Familia Vota, a Phoenix-based organization that tries to increase Latino civic engagement. The group will begin a major voter registration drive later this month. Surveys show that Clinton enjoys a 3-to-1 advantage over Trump among Latino voters. Flake, who is up for reelection in 2018, warned of the long-term consequences of Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric about Hispanic immigrants. “We can’t afford to alienate and demonize the largest-growing demographic out there,” Flake said, drawing a historical parallel. “Back in the ’60s, we Republicans lost the African American vote that we still haven’t gained back.” Asked what Trump could do to ensure a win in Arizona, Flake said: “Come up with a more realistic immigration policy than build a wall and make the Mexican government pay for it, walk back the Muslim ban, stop talking about getting rid of libel laws. Should I go on? I think we’re not in a good position. I think Mr. Trump is not where he needs to be to win a general election.” Arizona is not the only red state where Trump is vulnerable. In Georgia, Democrats dream of capitalizing on the large black and growing Latino populations to put the state in play. And in Utah, one of the nation’s most solidly Republican states, a recent poll had the race tied. Resistance to Trump among Mormons, who make up a majority of Utah’s voters, is intense; Romney is a leader of the “Never Trump” movement. The Mormon resistance may have an effect in Arizona as well. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints counts more than 400,000 members here, which is roughly 6 percent of the state’s population. If enough Mormons vote against Trump or stay home, it would depress his vote total. [The 2016 map of battleground states now includes Utah] The swing vote here traditionally is moderate Republican women — and doubts about Trump’s character have softened his support with this bloc. Arizona has a celebrated history of electing female executives, including Brewer and her predecessor, Democrat Janet Napolitano, which is another reason Clinton’s allies feel bullish. That is why Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D) is encouraged about her underdog race to unseat McCain. Kirkpatrick’s strategy is to saddle McCain with Trump’s baggage and convince Arizonans that their senior senator has lost his independence. “The fact that John McCain supports Trump is just another example that he’s changed, that he’s not the maverick,” Kirkpatrick said. “He wouldn’t even stand up to Donald Trump when Trump insulted him. He’s not going to stand up for us.” McCain declined a request to be interviewed for this article. The last Democrat to win Arizona in a presidential election was Bill Clinton in 1996, and friends here said he sees it as a personal crusade to help his wife carry the state this year. He made several trips to Arizona this spring and is planning to return for a fundraiser in a few weeks, local Democrats said. But even if he and others smell opportunity, party strategists think it is unlikely that Clinton would fully invest here because other battleground states, such as Ohio, will always be higher priorities. “It’s very unlikely that Arizona will be the 270th electoral vote. If it does go blue, it’s more likely to be the 357th electoral vote,” said Mitch Stewart, a senior official on Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. “Even though there is likely an opportunity, Arizona will likely be towards the back of the line as far as battleground states and money that’s being spent.” Still, Arizona Democrats think they can galvanize anti-Trump voters without the resources of a presidential targeting operation. Activists gathered at a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix one night last week for a meeting of the local Democracy for America chapter were almost gleeful about their good fortune. Donna Stebbins, the group’s leader, said she normally has to be prolific on social media for messages about the campaign to break through. But not this time. “People are so animated here,” she said. “With what Donald’s doing, we don’t even have to post much. ‘Donald Trump is having a no good, very bad week’ — that’s all I posted today.” Said state Rep. Jonathan Larkin, a Latino Democrat: “Trump has given us a lot to work with, that’s for sure.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.",

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Jeb Bush will be making a speech on foreign policy today, and if the excerpts that his campaign released to reporters beforehand are any indication, it will embody all the thoughtfulness, nuance and sophistication that have characterized Republican foreign policy thinking in recent years. If you were thinking that Bush might be the grown-up in this field — or offer something much different from the approach that was so disastrous for his brother — well, think again. It’s looking a lot like the return of the Bush Doctrine, just with a different Bush. As Peter Beinart writes in the new issue of the Atlantic, Republicans have embraced “the legend of the surge,” which starts off as a specific belief about what happened in Iraq and why, and then expands outward to justify a return to George W. Bush’s simplistic hawkish approach to any foreign policy challenge. To put it briefly, the change in strategy around the surge, and the “Sunni awakening” that occurred at the same time, were supposed to create the conditions in which a political reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites could take place. But that never happened, and the corruption and sectarianism of Nouri al-Maliki’s government laid the groundwork for the country’s continued civil war and eventually the rise of the Islamic State. But Republicans tell a different story, one that not only wipes away all the calamitous and naive decisions of the Bush administration but also can be used to justify a renewal of the Bush Doctrine anywhere. Here’s how Jeb will put it today: So: Everything was going great in Iraq and victory had been achieved, until Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton threw it all away. Nothing is the fault of Republicans, or of the people who supported and launched the Iraq war, the single worst foreign policy decision in American history. George W. Bush made no mistakes that might have any lessons for us, and the answer to every foreign policy challenge is to be more bellicose and more eager to use military force. [Bad news, Republicans: Donald Trump is practically bulletproof] And what should we do now? If you said that the key is “strength” and “leadership,” then give yourself a gold star: I challenge you to read that passage and tell me a single specific thing Bush plans to do. And then there’s Bush’s embrace of what has to be the single most inane objection Republicans have to Obama’s conduct in foreign affairs: “Despite elaborate efforts by the administration to avoid even calling it by name,” he’ll say, “one of the very gravest threats we face today comes from radical Islamic terrorists.” I’m not sure what “elaborate efforts” Bush is talking about, but it’s true that President Obama prefers not to use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism,” because he thinks that could serve to alienate Muslims around the world by reinforcing the radicals’ argument that Islam itself is at war with the West. Obama might be right or wrong about that, but it’s a relatively minor point. Yet to hear Republicans tell it, it is literally impossible to contain terrorism if the president doesn’t repeat this phrase on a regular basis. They say this so often and with such fervor that one has to assume they actually believe that the words “radical Islamic terrorism” constitute some sort of magical incantation, one that would turn our enemies’ guns to dust and cause the terrorists themselves to disappear in a puff of smoke if only it were spoken by the commander in chief. [What does the American public really think of the Iran deal?] You may remember a few weeks ago when Donald Trump said he had a spectacular, super-classy, guaranteed-to-work plan to destroy the Islamic State, but he wasn’t going to reveal it, lest the terrorists get wind of their impending demise. Then when he finally did, the plan was this: “I would bomb the hell out of those oil fields. I wouldn’t send many troops because you won’t need them by the time I’m finished.” Everyone laughed and shook their heads at the fact that a guy whose policy thinking operates at a fifth-grade level was leading the Republican field. But how much more sophisticated than that is what Bush and the other candidates are offering on foreign policy? For instance, if you read this recent manifesto from Marco Rubio, you’ll learn that he plans to lead with strength, so America can be strong and full of leadership. And also strength, because that’s what America needs to lead. Make no mistake: What Jeb Bush and the other GOP candidates (with the exception of Rand Paul) are offering on foreign policy is nothing more or less than a return to the Bush Doctrine. They won’t call it that, because they know that would be politically foolish; Americans may have short memories, but not that short. Maybe in their next debate, someone can ask them how their foreign policy would differ in any way from George W. Bush’s. I doubt they’d have an answer.

        "articles": "Laurence H. Tribe is Carl M. Loeb University Professor emeritus and a professor of constitutional law emeritus at Harvard Law School. Donald Trump managed to evade legal accountability throughout his presidency. That might be about to change — and the newest sign comes in a brief filed by the Justice Department. It doesn’t directly address the former president, yet has ominous implications for his ability to avoid responsibility for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. The Justice filing came in a lawsuit in which Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) and a number of Capitol Police officers have sued Trump and others for their roles in the insurrection. One of those named in the suit, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), claimed that he is immune from personal liability under a law known as the Westfall Act, which shields federal officials acting within the scope of their employment. U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta asked for the Justice Department’s position, and, in a filing Tuesday, the department resoundingly rejected Brooks’s view. This is a correct — indeed, an unavoidable — interpretation of the law. It is a view that is directly relevant to Trump’s potential liability in the Swalwell lawsuit and other pending litigation, and a welcome departure from the position endorsed by the Justice Department in the defamation lawsuit filed against Trump by writer E. Jean Carroll. In the Carroll case, the department accepted Trump’s argument that his disparaging comments about Carroll while he was president were within the broad scope of his responsibilities. Even recognizing the department’s legal duty to defend federal officials and to consider the implications of its actions for future presidents facing charges of wrongdoing, I strongly disagreed with that decision: Accusing someone of lying about your actions before you became president, as Trump did with Carroll’s rape accusation, cannot automatically fall within the scope of your presidential employment. In the Swalwell suit, the department adopted a narrower and, I believe, more legally defensible, stance about when federal employees are immune from suit. The department first invoked Brooks’s own “defense” that his appearance at Trump’s Jan. 6 rally before the insurrection was “campaign activity,” not part of his official position: He was trying to get Trump declared the winner of the 2020 election and to promote GOP wins in 2022 and 2024. That was, the department properly concluded, political activity, not remotely covered by any immunity. Even if Brooks’s appearance was not deemed campaign-related, the department added, he still is not entitled to immunity because he was accused of violating federal law — by definition, not part of his job. “Instigat[ing] a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol … plainly could not be within the scope of federal employment,” the brief said. Where does that leave Trump, who is also a defendant in the lawsuit and has also asked that it be dismissed? Not in great legal shape, in my view. Granted, the distinction between campaign and official duties could be harder to make in the case of a president, whose role inextricably combines both aspects of the job. Nonetheless, the department’s forceful conclusion was that Brooks’s alleged actions — conspiring to “injure members of Congress and Vice President Pence,” “disrupt the peaceful transfer of power,” or otherwise ensure Trump’s installation as the next president — cannot qualify as part of Brooks’s official job. That irrefutable logic is equally applicable to Trump. Tellingly, the department’s brief said, “Inciting or conspiring to foment a violent attack on the United States Congress is not within the scope of employment of a Representative — or any federal employee,” a category manifestly including the president himself. Trump, in asking the judge to dismiss the case against him, referred to the Westfall Act in a footnote, arguing that “the allegations arose out of his [exercise] of political speech, clearly within the scope of his employment (i.e., ensuring the faithful execution of the laws and carrying out his other Constitutional duties).” Then he made an even more jaw-dropping claim: “The Constitution Forecloses This Court from Exercising Jurisdiction Over President Trump for Actions Taken During His Presidency.” In defense of this audacious assertion, Trump’s lawyers cite the Supreme Court’s 1982 decision in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, which held that presidents are immune from civil suit for most official actions. But the court in that case made clear it wasn’t addressing civil suits based on specific federal statutes, as the Swalwell suit is. It also articulated a vital limiting principle: actions that do not fall “within the outer perimeter of [the president’s] duties of office” can subject the president to liability. “A political speech by the President is not at the ‘outer perimeter’ of his duties — it is at the dead center,” the Trump lawyers claim. “It is well recognized that rousing and controversial speeches are a key function of the presidency.” But, as Swalwell and other plaintiffs argue, Trump went far beyond giving a controversial speech. He insisted that he had won reelection regardless of what anyone said and stirred up a violent, partly armed and visibly angry mob and aimed it at the Capitol to disrupt the official counting of electoral votes. He stood by and even praised the mob as it grew violent, rejecting requests to help those under assault. Inciting an attack on Congress “is not within the scope of employment of … any federal employee,” the department reminded us, and Trump, in its brief. That single word, “any,” marks the difference between a president and a dictator. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "Desktop notifications are on | Turn off Get breaking news alerts from The Washington Post Turn on desktop notifications? Bruce Bartlett takes a look at the Balanced Budget Amendment all 47 Republicans signed their names to and pronounces it “quite possibly the stupidest constitutional amendment I think I have ever seen. It looks like it was drafted by a couple of interns on the back of a napkin.” I think “stupid” is the wrong word. “Dangerous” is more like it. And maybe “radical.” This isn’t just a Balanced Budget Amendment. It also includes a provision saying that tax increases would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress — so, it includes a provision making it harder to balance the budget — and another saying that total spending couldn’t exceed 18 percent of GDP. No allowances are made for recessions, though allowances are made for wars. Not a single year of the Bush administration would qualify as constitutional under this amendment. Nor would a single year of the Reagan administration. The Clinton administration would’ve had exactly two years in which it wasn’t in violation. Read that again: Every single Senate Republican has endorsed a constitutional amendment that would’ve made Ronald Reagan’s fiscal policy unconstitutional. That’s how far to the right the modern GOP has swung. But the problem isn’t simply that the proposed amendment is extreme. It’s also unworkable. The baby boomers are retiring and health costs are rising. Unless you have a way to stop one or the other from happening — and no one does — spending as a percentage of GDP is going to have to rise. This proposal doesn’t interrupt those trends. It simply refuses to acknowledge them — or, to be more generous, it rules them unconstitutional. This is the equivalent of trying to keep your kid cute by passing a law saying he’s not allowed to grow up. Another problem: In a recession, tax revenue plummets and GDP stops growing, but spending has to be sustained, or even increased, to a) give people unemployment insurance and Medicaid and other services they need and b) keep the economy from contracting violently. This amendments includes no provisions for recessions, meaning that when the economy contracted, the government would have to contract as well. That is to say, we’re still not out of one of the deepest recessions in American history, and every Senate Republican has co-sponsored a constitutional amendment to make future recessions worse. It’s just breathtaking. A world in which this amendment is added to the Constitution is a world in which America effectively becomes California. It’s a world where the procedural impediments to passing budgets and raising revenues are so immense that effective fiscal management is essentially impossible; it’s a world where we can’t make public investments or sustain the safety net; it’s a world where recessions are much worse than they currently are and the government has to do more of its work off-budget through regulation and gimmickry. I would like to say something positive about this proposal, say there’s some silver lining here. But there isn’t. This is economic demagoguery, and nothing more. It’s so unrealistic that it would’ve ruled all but two of the last 30 years unconstitutional, which means it’s so unrealistic that there has not yet been a Republican president who has proven it can be done. And that doesn’t just suggest it can’t be done: It suggests that when Republicans are actually in power and have control of the budget, they know perfectly well that it shouldn’t be done. They’re just pretending otherwise for the moment. Please enter a valid email address. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You’re all set!

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old THE MORNING PLUM: President Trump’s choice of John Bolton as his new national security adviser — and his ongoing escalation of trade hostilities and reshuffling of his legal team — have all been widely interpreted as evidence that Trump is finally governing and conducting himself as he wanted to all along. He’s tired of advisers who are steering him away from his true agenda and persona, goes this narrative; instead, he’s finally getting back to the basics that make Trump who he really is. But this framing is built on a distortion that underplays just how dangerous Trump’s evolution really threatens to become. What’s really happening is that Trump is increasingly surrounding himself with advisers who are better than the “adults in the room” at manipulating his erratic and shifting impulses and whims, by giving a shape to them he can accept and act upon. Axios reports this morning that sources close to Trump say he “feels” that Bolton “will finally deliver the foreign policy the president wants” on Iran and North Korea. What makes this account almost certainly dead on is the word “feels.” As Michael Warren of the Weekly Standard points out, Bolton has skillfully used his conservative media perches to send messages to Trump that nudge him toward “more hawkish stances” by “casting them as fulfillments of Trump’s own pledges and true beliefs.” Bolton wants to bomb Iran. There is no particular reason to believe that Trump either favors or opposes that stance. Trump knows that the Iran nuclear deal is bad because Barack Obama negotiated it; Trump knows Trump is strong and Obama is weak; and Trump knows his supporters cheered when he vowed to rip the agreement to shreds. But Trump has not meaningfully articulated why we should pull out of it, because he can’t. And so, when Trump was debating whether to certify the Iran deal last summer and was unhappy with advisers urging him to do so on substantive grounds, then-adviser Stephen K. Bannon handed him a piece by Bolton urging him to decertify. Bolton’s piece cast that as the only course consistent with Trump’s “view that the Iran deal was a diplomatic debacle,” because Obama had given Iran “unimaginably favorable terms.” Trump has no idea whether this is true — it isn’t — but it persuaded Trump to come close to decertifying, though ultimately the adults prevailed that time. The point is that Trump doesn’t grasp the details, but Bolton skillfully gave shape to his impulses. Now Bolton will be in an even better position to persuade Trump to kill the Iran deal, and if and when that happens, to push Trump more in the direction of his own bellicose designs, which Bolton will almost certainly cast as in keeping with Trump’s vow to be tougher than Obama. Or take North Korea. Everyone knows that when Trump agreed to meet with Kim Jong Un, he did so on an impulse, with no thought through rationale or sense of the risks and complexities involved. Bolton wants to go to war with North Korea and has dismissed talks. But he cleverly greeted Trump’s announcement by describing it as “shock and awe” and an opportunity for Trump to give North Korea an ultimatum if it does not immediately begin “total denuclearization.” This, too, gave a shape to Trump’s impulse that he will very probably find flattering, but also one that might move Trump toward Bolton’s position. If Trump now “feels” that Bolton will give him the policies he wants on Iran and North Korea, it’s because Bolton is skilled at making Trump feel that way. That’s ominous, because it means Bolton may be able to push Trump toward believing that Bolton’s goals are a realization of his own foreign policy vision, such as it is. Trump’s vision is formless And that foreign policy vision is formless. During the campaign, Trump opposed the Iraq War, sending the message that he won’t get drawn into the misguidedly idealistic or stupidly conceived military adventurism so typical of our clueless, corrupt elites. But Trump has never been either antiwar or an isolationist. His posture was rather that he will magically smash our enemies and aggressively represent our interests abroad effortlessly, without any serious cost, because he’s tougher, stronger and smarter than those elites. How hard will it be for Bolton to shape those impulses into something more in line with his own vision? On trade, the process leading to Trump’s decision to impose tariffs was a joke with no regard for specifics. But it did showcase the rising star of trade adviser Peter Navarro, who unabashedly stated that he had provided the “analytics” to “confirm his intuition,” which is “always right.” Trump just pushed out lawyer John Dowd, who advised careful cooperation with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and has added Joe diGenova, who has fed Trump’s fantasies of a “deep-state” plot against him, signaling the much more aggressive confrontation with Mueller that Trump clearly craves, without having the foggiest strategic rationale. In both cases, these people are successfully giving shape to Trump’s impulses. As Michelle Goldberg recently observed, one after another, the people who are supposed to be “checking Donald Trump’s worst instincts and most erratic whims” have departed. But this doesn’t mean Trump is getting back to being who he always wanted to be. It means he is increasingly listening to people who are good at exploiting and shaping those instincts and whims. * KELLY WANTED McMASTER OUT, BUT NOT BOLTON IN: The New York Times reports some of the backstory on why Trump is replacing McMaster with Bolton: Also, as the Times notes, McMaster committed the sin of acknowledging that Russia interfered in our election, which drew Trump’s Twitter wrath. * BOLTON FAVORS REGIME CHANGE IN IRAN: The Post’s write-up reminds us that Bolton has gone a lot further than merely calling for withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal: Why, yes, Bolton did indeed call for bombing Iran in 2015. * A FRIGHTENING CHOICE: Vox’s Zack Beauchamp aptly sums up Bolton’s career and the significance of his appointment: As Christopher Preble of the Cato Institute puts it: “Bolton should be kept as far away from the levers of foreign policy as possible.” * BOLTON DEEPLY ALARMS DEMS: This quote from Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut aptly sums up the reaction of many Democrats to the Bolton appointment: McMaster had urged caution against scrapping the Iran deal, though he’d also urged a hard line against North Korea. Now we’ve got someone even more hawkish. * SPENDING BILL PASSES AS REPUBLICANS SCRAP PRINCIPLES: The Post reports that the Senate passed the massive $1.3 trillion omnibus, which jacks up spending on defense and non-defense spending alike: Anyone who is surprised by this hasn’t been paying attention to how Republicans have operated for the last decade or more. * TRUMP THREATENS VETO: Hello, Mr. President: Does Trump understand that he could have lots of wall funding if he agreed to permanent protections for the “dreamers”? * TRADE WAR COULD HURT TRUMP COUNTRY: Bloomberg reports that China has taken retaliatory moves against Trump’s latest round of tariffs that could hit Trump country hard: Anyone in Trump country who is hurt by this should rest assured that Trump has vowed that it will be “easy” to “win” any trade war he causes. * TRUMP BUMBLES INTO TRADE WAR: Paul Krugman notes that China is behaving badly by ripping off intellectual property, but he argues that a trade war is exactly the wrong way to do anything about it: And as Krugman notes, the big picture is that Trump is squandering our global reputation, which will help… China.

        "articles": "Were the lungs the seat of wisdom, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly would be wise, but they are not and he is not. So it is not astonishing that he is doubling down on his wager that the truth cannot catch up with him. It has, however, already done so. The prolific O’Reilly has, with his collaborator Martin Dugard, produced five “history” books in five years: “Killing Lincoln,” “Killing Kennedy, “Killing Jesus,” “Killing Patton” and now the best-selling “Killing Reagan.” Because no one actually killed Reagan, O’Reilly keeps his lucrative series going by postulating that the bullet that struck Reagan in March 1981 kind of, sort of killed him, although he lived 23 more years. O’Reilly “reports” that the trauma of the assassination attempt was somehow causally related to the “fact” that Reagan was frequently so mentally incompetent that senior aides contemplated using the Constitution’s 25th Amendment to remove him from office. But neither O’Reilly nor Dugard spoke with any of those aides — not with Ed Meese, Jim Baker, George Shultz or any of the scores of others who could, and would, have demolished O’Reilly’s theory. O’Reilly now airily dismisses them because they “have skin in the game.” His is an interesting approach to writing history: Never talk to anyone with firsthand knowledge of your subject. [More: Bill O’Reilly slanders Ronald Reagan] Instead, O’Reilly made the book’s “centerpiece” a memo he has never seen and never tried to see until 27 days after the book was published. Then Dugard asked the Reagan Presidential Library to find it. Recently on Fox News, O’Reilly put this on the screen from Sue Janzen of Yorba Linda, Calif.: “We went to the Reagan Library, and were told they do not sell Killing Reagan because it’s not factual.” Then O’Reilly said: “You were deceived, Sue. The Reagan Library is angry at Martin Dugard and me because we’re seeking” the Cannon memo. He added: “The memo’s disappeared. But Dugard and I are on the case and the library is not happy about it.” “Disappeared”? His crude intimation was that the allegedly deceptive library is hiding the memo. The library, however, has never had it because when James Cannon wrote it, he was not a member of the White House staff, hence the memo was not a “presidential record.” O’Reilly recently canceled an interview with Meese, who says O’Reilly told him he was “vetting” the memo. (How does one vet a memo one does not possess?) O’Reilly says he canceled the interview because Meese set “conditions.” Meese, who was eager to be interviewed, waived any conditions. [Erik Wemple: Bill O’Reilly renounces journalism] The “centerpiece” memo was written by Cannon at the request of former senator Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) when Baker was about to replace the fired Don Regan as Reagan’s chief of staff. The memo assessing White House conditions apparently included disparagements of Reagan from some unhappy Regan staffers. The memo was presented to Baker at a meeting at Baker’s home attended by A.B. Culvahouse, who the next day would become counsel to the president. Culvahouse remembers the normally mild-mannered Baker brusquely dismissing the memo: “That’s not the Reagan I met with two days ago.” Neither Baker nor Culvahouse considered the memo important enough to save. Meeting with Reagan the next day, Baker and others found no reason to question his competence. O’Reilly impales himself on a contradiction: He says his book is “laudatory” about Reagan — and that it is being attacked by Reagan “guardians” and “loyalists.” How odd. Liberals, who have long recognized that to discredit conservatism they must devalue Reagan’s presidency, surely are delighted with O’Reilly’s assistance. The diaspora of Reagan administration alumni, and the conservative movement, now recognize O’Reilly as an opportunistic interloper. He began his profitable paltering with America’s past with “Killing Lincoln.” Historians advising the National Park Service, which administers Ford’s Theatre, found a multitude of errors in the first, uncorrected version, in which, for example, O’Reilly repeatedly places Lincoln in the Oval Office, which was built in 1909. The Theatre bookstore still does not sell “Killing Lincoln.” The Theatre gift shop, a commercial rather than educational entity, does. Four “histories” later, O’Reilly remains slipshod. In “The Great Gatsby,” F. Scott Fitzgerald writes of Tom and Daisy Buchanan, who “smashed up things” and then “retreated back into . . . their vast carelessness . . . and let other people clean up the mess they had made.” Tidying up after O’Reilly could be a full-time job but usually is not worth the trouble. When, however, O’Reilly’s vast carelessness pollutes history and debases the historian’s craft, the mess is, unlike O’Reilly, to be taken seriously. Read more from George F.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old “Estimates are that the TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership] could provide $77 billion a year in real income and support 650,000 new jobs in the U.S. alone.” –Secretary of State John F. Kerry, in an opinion article titled “Alliances for Peace,” Jan. 14, 2015 “Completing the Trans-Pacific Partnership provides the opportunity to open up markets, lower tariffs and, according to the Peterson Institute, increase U.S. exports by $123 billion and help support an additional 650,000 jobs.” — Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, in an interview with the Greater Baton Rouge Business Report, Jan. 26, 2015 The Fact Checker frequently warns readers to be wary of claims by politicians that various policy initiatives will yield tens of thousands of jobs. Such claims are often based on studies that rely on a variety of assumptions, any of which can be called into question. So we were interested when we received a call from a reader who wondered how the administration calculated that a proposed international trade agreement, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, would support some 650,000 jobs. The Obama administration is on a full-court press to complete negotiations on the trade pact, involving 12 Pacific Rim nations, and also win from Congress the authority for an up-or-down vote from lawmakers, which officials say is necessary to close the deal. The TPP is one of the few areas in which the White House can expect strong support from Republicans, though many Democrats remain skeptical or hostile. The Fact Checker of course takes no position on whether the proposed trade deal is good or bad. But we were curious about how this number was calculated. Notice that Vilsack referred to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which is a well-regarded centrist think tank that focuses on international economic policy. The Peterson Institute advocates for free-trade agreements but also for programs that aid people who may be hurt by globalization. The Peterson Institute in 2012 published a book titled “The Trans-Pacific Partnership and Asia-Pacific Integration: A Quantitative Assessment,” by Peter A. Petri, Michael G. Plummer and Fan Zhai. The book does include an estimate that, by 2025, the United States would experience a gain of $77.5 billion in income from TPP, as well as a $124 billion increase in exports. (More on those numbers, which are expressed in 2007 dollars, below.) But nowhere in the book does it says 650,000 jobs would be created. Asked about the statistic on 650,000 jobs, the White House referred us to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. USTR spokesman Matthew McAlvanah directed us to page 58 of the book. “They do not provide an estimate on jobs,” he acknowledged. “However they do provide a methodology that one could use.” Essentially, the book suggests that an income gain of $121,000 would be “roughly equivalent to creating an extra job.” So the Obama administration took the figure of $77.5 billion and divided it by $121,000, which yields 640,000. Rounded up, that becomes 650,000. There’s just one problem: This is the incorrect way to use Petri’s research, especially when officials such as Kerry combine the jobs figure in the same sentence as the income prediction: “The TPP could provide $77 billion a year in real income and support 650,000 new jobs in the US alone.” That’s because the calculation on jobs can only be done if one assumes that wages have been frozen and there is no income gain. So it’s completely misleading to suggest there would be both a gain in income and a gain in jobs. Petri said that his book did not discuss job gains because mainstream economists do not believe that the number of jobs is significantly affected by trade policy. “The reason we don’t project employment is that, like most trade economists, we don’t believe that trade agreements change the labor force in the long run. The consequential factors are demography, immigration, retirement benefits, etc.,” he said. “Rather, trade agreements affect how people are employed, and ideally substitute more productive jobs for less productive ones and thus raise real incomes.” The same dynamic exists with the claim that the trade bill would increase exports by $124 billion by 2025. The Commerce Department estimates that about 5,500 jobs are supported by every $1 billion in exports, so in theory that also would yield about 650,000 jobs. But that calculation would ignore the fact that the Petri book found that imports would increase by virtually the same amount as exports, meaning the net number of new jobs is zero. The mix of jobs would change, however. “Employment could be negatively affected by the adjustment implications of a trade agreement,” Petri said. “We estimate ‘job shifts’—employment moving from one sector to another—and in difficult labor markets such shifts can lead to transitional unemployment, retirement or wage cuts.” But, he added, “in the case of the TPP such shifts will be small and slow, dwarfed by routine job separations and new hires in the economy. So adjustments and costs should be covered many times by gains. This makes possible strong transitional assistance for workers and communities that are adversely affected.” Finally, let’s put these numbers in context. Petri’s book says that a gain of $77.5 billion in income amounts to just a 0.4 percent increase in the pre-trade-deal baseline for the United States’ $20-trillion gross domestic product. You read that right—0.4 percent. Indeed, a gain of 650,000 jobs would also be just 0.4 percent of projected employment of 168 million people, Petri said. “The percentage change is small,” Petri acknowledged, which he said is what one would expect from a large and efficient economy such as the United States. (Vietnam, by contrast, would see a gain of nearly 14 percent in income according to Petri’s model.) There is, of course, a long history of presidential administrations touting imaginary job gains from trade deals. “I believe that NAFTA will create 200,000 American jobs in the first two years of its effect,” then-President Bill Clinton said in 1993, when he signed supplemental agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement. “I believe that NAFTA will create a million jobs in the first 5 years of its impact.” Clinton was relying in part on analyses generated by the Peterson Institute. Two years later, after a financial meltdown in Mexico and collapse of the peso evaporated any job gains from NAFTA, the economist who generated the forecasts famously said he would stay away from job forecasting in the future. In 2012, C. Fred Bergsten, the founder of the Peterson Institute, conceded the Institute had “big internal debates” over whether to calculate job numbers. “Congress always wants to know how many jobs they’re going to create,” Bergsten said. “As good economists, we all take the view I think that trade agreement does not unbalance, create, or destroy jobs, it alters the composition of the workforce.” McAlvanah provided the following response: We note his statement did not address the fact that the study itself did not offer these calculations — or that effects of one action, such as more exports, are canceled out by another action, such as imports. Clearly, with the Peterson Institute refusing to play the game this time and cough up a jobs number, the administration decided to concoct its own. But, as we have shown, one cannot at the same time claim both a gain of $77 billion in income and a gain of 650,000 jobs; the same effects simply cannot happen at once. Moreover, these are big numbers with virtually no context. It is pretty lame to use such huge numbers to tout what, in the context of the U.S. economy, amounts to minuscule changes in income —10 years from now. Our advice remains: be wary whenever a politician claims a policy will yield bountiful jobs. In this case, the correct number is zero (in the long run), not 650,000, according to the very study used to calculate this number. Administration officials earn Four Pinocchios for their fishy math.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have confirmed they are force-feeding nine detainees who initiated a hunger strike at an El Paso detention center. Ten detainees at the facility are under a self-imposed hunger strike, ICE spokeswoman Danielle Bennett said in an email Saturday. Of the 10, nine are from India, and one is from Nicaragua, Bennett said. Nine of them missed nine consecutive meals, triggering ICE’s hunger strike protocols — medical evaluations and health monitoring. At various points in mid-January, a federal judge ordered the nine to be fed and hydrated without consent, according to ICE. ICE’s update comes on the heels of a report by the Associated Press, which revealed on Wednesday that six detainees were being force-fed at the El Paso facility. They are on a hunger strike to protest “rampant verbal abuse and threats of deportation from guards.” The AP report triggered outrage from lawmakers and human rights groups who decried the practice as “cruel, inhuman and degrading.” She won a lawsuit over her immigration arrest. But ICE detained her again before she could seek any money. One detainee on a hunger strike detailed to the wire service the excruciating experience of guards dragging him from his cell and constraining him to force-feed him through a nasal tube. “They tie us on the force-feeding bed, and then they put a lot of liquid into the tubes, and the pressure is immense so we end up vomiting it out,” the detainee, identified only by his surname, Singh, told the AP. “We can’t talk properly, and we can’t breathe properly. The pipe is not an easy process, but they try to push it down our noses and throats.” Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Tex.), whose district includes the El Paso Processing Center, said she was “deeply alarmed” by reports that detainees were being force-fed and immediately requested a visit. On Thursday, she said she was able to meet the six detainees being force-fed — at the time, the only ones — before that number increased to nine a day later. ICE has not identified the detainees being force-fed, beyond their countries of origin. Escobar said most of the detainees she met had been in custody for 15 to 18 months. ICE has said it “fully respects the rights of all people to voice their opinion without interference” and that agency health officials have explained to the detainees the negative health effects of going on a hunger strike. “ICE does not retaliate in any way against hunger strikers,” the agency said in a statement. “For their health and safety, ICE closely monitors the food and water intake of those detainees identified as being on a hunger strike.” Besides the El Paso detention center, there are four other detainees on a hunger strike nationwide, ICE said Saturday: one each in ICE custody at facilities in Miami, Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco. Homeland Security IG questions ICE’s oversight of detention facilities Human Rights Watch has called on ICE to stop the “inherently cruel, inhuman and degrading” practice of force-feeding. “Medical ethics and human rights norms generally prohibit the force feeding of detainees who are competent and capable of rational judgment as to the consequences of refusing food,” the group said in a statement. “Hunger striking is a desperate expressive act. In immigration detention, it can be a response to the irrationality of prolonged and needless detention.\" In August, Mergensana Amar, a Russian citizen who had been in U.S. immigration custody for more than a year, launched a hunger strike that nearly killed him at a detention center in Tacoma, Wash., The Post reported. He survived — then died in November after he tried to hang himself. “Amar’s death is an example of the lengths that ICE will go to keep people in detention,” Maru Mora Villalpando, a community organizer with NWDC Resistance, an organization that tried to help Amar, said at the time. “They could have released him, and they decided not to. He kept telling us, ‘I’d rather die here than be deported.’ ” Read more: ICE detainee hanged himself after being taken off suicide watch Two Americans were detained by a Border Patrol agent after he heard them speaking Spanish ICE set up a fake university.

        "articles": "I am not a Christian. But growing up in India, I was immersed in Christianity. I attended Catholic and Anglican schools from ages 5 to 18, where we would sing hymns, recite prayers and study the Scriptures. The words and actions of Pope Francis have reminded me what I, as an outsider, have always admired deeply about Christianity, that its central message is simple and powerful: Be nice to the poor. When I came to the United States in the 1980s, I remember being surprised to see what “Christian values” had come to mean in American culture and politics — heated debates over abortion, abstinence, contraception and gays. In 13 years of reading, reciting and studying the Bible, I didn’t recall seeing much about these topics. That’s because there is very little in there about them. As Garry Wills points out in his perceptive new book, “The Future of the Catholic Church with Pope Francis,” “Many of the most prominent and contested stands taken by Catholic authorities (most of them dealing with sex) have nothing to do with the Gospel.” The church’s positions on these matters were arrived at through interpretations of “natural law,” which is not based on anything in the Bible. But because those grounds looked weak, conservative clergy sought to bolster their views with biblical sanction. So contraception was condemned by Pope Pius XI, Wills notes, through a pretty tortuous interpretation of a couple of lines in Genesis that say Onan “spilled his seed on the ground” — since it involves ejaculation without the intent of conception. The ban of women in the Catholic clergy is a similar stretch. When the Anglicans decided to ordain female priests in 1976, Pope Paul VI presented a theological reason not to follow that path. Women could not be priests, he decreed, because Jesus never ordained a female priest. “True enough,” Wills writes. “But neither did he ordain any men. There are no priests (other than the Jewish ones) in the four Gospels. Peter and Paul and their fellows neither call themselves priests nor are called priests by others.” Wills even takes on abortion, opposition to which some Catholics have taken as fundamental to their faith. “This is odd,” Wills writes, “since the matter is nowhere mentioned in the Old Testament or New Testament, or in the early creeds. But some people are convinced that God must hate such an immense evil and must have expressed that hatred somewhere in his Bible.” In fact, Wills points out, the ban is based on a complex extrapolation from vague language in one verse, Psalm 139:13. If you want to understand the main message of Jesus Christ, you don’t have to search the Scriptures. He says it again and again. “Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.” Jesus has specific advice on how to handle the poor. Treat them as you would Christ himself, sell your possessions and give to the poor. When you hold a banquet, Jesus says, do not invite the wealthy and powerful, because you do so in the hope that they will return the favor and reward you. Instead, invite the dispossessed — and you will be rewarded by God. It is because he expects so much from the rich that he said that it was easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get to heaven. We live in a meritocratic age and believe that people who are successful are more admirable in some way than the rest of us. But the Bible notes that “the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise . . . but time and chance happeneth to them all.” In the Kingdom of Heaven, it warns, “the last shall be first, and the first last.” In other words, be thankful for your success, but don’t think it makes you superior in any deep sense. Commentators have taken Francis’s speeches and sayings and attacked him or claimed him as a Marxist, a unionist and a radical environmentalist. I don’t think the pope is proposing an alternative system of politics or economics. He is simply reminding each of us that we have a moral obligation to be kind and generous to the poor and disadvantaged — especially if we have been fortunate. If you have a problem with this message, you have a problem not with Pope Francis, but with Jesus Christ.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old President Trump on Monday will offer a budget plan that falls far short of eliminating the government’s deficit over 10 years, conceding that huge tax cuts and new spending increases make this goal unattainable, three people familiar with the proposal said. Eliminating the budget deficit over 10 years has been a North Star for the Republican Party for several decades, and GOP lawmakers took the government to the brink of default in 2011 when they demanded a vote on a amendment to the Constitution that would prohibit the federal government from spending more than it takes in. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), when he used to chair the House Budget Committee, routinely proposed tax and spending outlines that would eliminate the deficit over 10 years, even though critics said his changes would lead to a severe curtailment in government programs. In 2013, Ryan proposed $4.6 trillion in cuts over 10 years, an amount he said was sufficient to eliminate the deficit. Those changes were not adopted by Congress or supported by the Obama administration. The White House and GOP leaders have largely jettisoned goals like this since Trump took office last year. Trump’s budget plan will call for a range of spending cuts that reduces the growth of the deficit by $3 trillion over 10 years, but it would not eliminate the deficit entirely, said the people familiar with the proposal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans before they’re publicly unveiled. GOP leaders have prioritized the tax-cut plan and a major increase to military spending over their past calls for eliminating the deficit. A vocal minority of GOP lawmakers have complained about this shift, but they proved no match for the bulk of the party last week when spending levels for the next two years were expanded. Still, when Trump proposes a budget that falls far short of eliminating the deficit, it could heighten complaints from conservatives who have said the Republican party has strayed too far. In 2017, Trump’s budget proposal sought to eliminate the deficit over 10 years, though his budget writers were ridiculed for what some alleged was a $2 trillion math error. The U.S. government spends more money than it brings in through revenue, a gap known as the budget deficit. The government ran a deficit of $666 billion in 2017. The deficit in 2019 is expected to eclipse $1.1 trillion, in part because of measures put in place since Trump took office. In June, the Congressional Budget Office projected the U.S. government would run deficits of roughly $10 trillion over the next decade. Since that report, Congress passed a tax-cut law that is projected to add at least $1 trillion to the debt over 10 years, and last week, Congress agreed on roughly $500 billion in new spending measures over the next two years. It could not be learned how large the White House projects the deficit will be after 10 years. Even after accounting for the $3 trillion in cuts they will offer, the White House is expected to project the economy will grow at a much stronger clip than many economists believe will occur. The faster the economy grows, the more tax revenue will increase, helping offset spending. Policymakers typically try to contract the deficit when the economy is strong and let it expand when the economy is weak. But the White House and Congress have in recent months sought to take a different approach, expanding the deficit when the unemployment rate is very low and the economy is growing at a stronger rate. The U.S. government already has roughly $20 trillion in debt, according to some measures. Rising interest rates will make this debt more expensive for taxpayers, a phenomenon budget watchers believe could make it harder for the U.S. government to respond to an economic crisis. In a brief synopsis of the budget released by the White House Sunday evening, it said it “imposes a fiscal discipline on Washington spending that many in today’s political climate reject, yet which remains more important than ever.” The budget is expected to target spending cuts at social welfare programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, large segments of government spending that have long been eyed by Republicans for cuts. The White House is looking at ways to curb these programs by expanding work requirements for beneficiaries, but it is unclear how much money changes like this would save or whether it would find enough political support. The White House on Sunday evening revealed several parts of the budget that called for spending increases but didn’t detail a single area it planned to propose cutting. For example, it called for $200 billion in federal funds for Trump’s infrastructure plan, $23 billion for border security and immigration enforcement, $85.5 billion for veterans programs and $13 billion over the next two years to combat the opioid epidemic.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old The super-sized Pew Research Center poll out today has a lot of fascinating things to say about our polarized politics. But it's also chock-full of goodies on a related but less-talked about driver of our political troubles: partisan animosity. Writing over at Monkeycage earlier this year, Sean Theriault called the phenomenon \"partisan warfare\" and defined it as such: When Democrats and Republicans can't reach consensus on the proper role of government in healthcare, that's partisan polarization. But when Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA) says that \"Obamacare is going to destroy everything we know as a nation,\" that's partisan warfare. As it turns out, partisan warfare, like polarization, is highly asymmetric. Animosity and ill will are significantly more concentrated at the conservative end of the ideological spectrum. Here are some charts from Pew breaking that down. \"Today, the majority of ideologically-oriented Americans hold deeply negative views of the other side,\" the Pew authors write. \"This is particularly true on the right, as 72% of consistent conservatives have a very unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party. Consistent liberals do not feel as negatively toward the GOP.\" Liberal animosity toward Republicans has actually ticked down slightly between 2011 and 2014, while conservative antipathy toward Democrats shot up sharply over the same period. Conservatives are even angrier at their own party - 6 percent of consistent conservatives have deeply unfavorable opinions about the Republican party, while 3 percent of consistent liberals feel the same about Democrats. It what may be the most unsettling of the Pew survey's findings, large numbers of Americans say that people who don't share their political views are a threat to America. But as expected, the rate of distrust is higher among Republicans -- 36 percent of Republicans say the Democratic party is a threat to the nation's well-being. Only 27 percent of Democrats say the same. Among the most partisan Republicans and Democrats, the gap is even larger: fully two-thirds of consistently conservative Republicans say that Democratic policies will harm the U.S. Only - \"only\" - half of consistently liberal Democrats say the same about Republican policies. The Pew authors note that Obama Derangement Syndrome is one of the factors driving Republicans' intense distrust of Democratic policies. \"At least in part, the strongly negative views Republicans have of the Democratic Party reflect their deep-seated dislike of Barack Obama,\" they write. Two-thirds of consistently conservative Americans say that most of their friends share their political views. Less than a third say many of their friends do not share their views. Even among mostly conservative Americans, there's a strong preference for politically like-minded friends. Conversely, only a quarter of mostly liberal Americans say their friends share their political views, and more than 40 percent say that many of their friends do not have the same views. The most liberal Americans do show a preference for like-minded friends, but at a much lower rate (49 percent) than their conservative counterparts (63 percent). Simply put, conservatives are much more likely to interact only with people who share their views, which reinforces those views even further. It's no surprise that conservatives watch Fox News while liberals tune into MSNBC. But the Pew study shows that conservatives are much more unified in their preference for Fox - 74 percent of consistent conservatives have a favorable opinion of Fox, compared to only 45 percent of consistent liberals with a favorable view of MSNBC. This is consistent with a recent study from the Public Religion Research Institute showing that Republicans' devotion to Fox is nearly absolute, while there is no similarly dominant news source among Democrats. This may be the most telling chart in the Pew report. You'd expect partisans on either end of the ideological spectrum to be less fond of compromise than those in the middle. But as it turns out, compromise is basically a liberal value - 82 percent of consistent liberals prefer politicians who make compromises. Less than a third of consistent conservatives say the same. It's important to note that when it comes to the actual practice of compromise, both liberals and conservatives have a hard time grasping what the word actually means. But liberals are much more into the notion of compromise as a political ideal. Conservatives, on the other hands, have a stated preference for candidates who \"stick to their positions.\" A party that is ideologically predisposed against compromise is going to have a very hard time governing, particularly within a divided government. You can see this reflected in the Tea Party's repeated enthusiasm for shutting the entire government down instead of passing pieces of legislation they disagree with.

        "articles": "The Justice Department on Monday charged a former CIA officer with repeatedly leaking classified information, including the identities of agency operatives involved in the capture and interrogation of alleged terrorists. The case against John Kiriakou, who also served as a senior Senate aide, extends the Obama administration’s crackdown on disclosures of national security secrets. Kiriakou, 47, is the sixth target of a leaks-related prosecution since President Obama took office, exceeding the total number of comparable prosecutions under all previous administrations combined, legal experts said. Kiriakou, who was among the first to go public with details about the CIA’s use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation measures, was charged with disclosing classified information to reporters and lying to the agency about the origin of other sensitive material he published in a book. He faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted. In its criminal filing, the Justice Department obscured many of the details of Kiriakou’s alleged disclosures. But the document suggests that Kiriakou was a source for stories by the New York Times and other news organizations in 2008 and 2009 about some of the agency’s most sensitive operations after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. These include the capture of alleged al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaida and the interrogation of the self-proclaimed mastermind of the attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed. The Justice Department said that the information Kiriakou supplied to journalists also contributed to a subsequent security breach at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, enabling defense attorneys there to obtain photographs of CIA operatives suspected of being involved in harsh interrogations. Some of the pictures were subsequently discovered in the cells of high-value detainees. Kiriakou, who worked for the CIA from 1990 to 2004, was charged with four counts, including disclosing the identity of an undercover officer and providing classified information to individuals not authorized to receive it. In an appearance in U.S. District Court in Alexandria on Monday afternoon, Magistrate Judge John F. Anderson set bond at $250,000 for Kiriakou, who was also forced to surrender his passport and restrict his travel to the Washington area. Kiriakou did not comment on the charges in court. He wore a blue dress shirt and black dress slacks but no tie. Plato Cacheris, Kiriakou’s attorney, said his client would plead not guilty and expected to be released on bond. The surge in such prosecutions is seen as a measure of the Obama administration’s determination to root out leaks, but it may also reflect the government’s expanded ability to mine suspects’ e-mail accounts and other digital devices for incriminating evidence. The complaint filed Monday includes numerous passages apparently taken from Kiriakou’s e-mail exchanges with reporters as well as former CIA colleagues. Critics warn that the crackdown will erode the ability of news organizations to expose government abuses. Steven Aftergood, an expert on government secrecy issues at the Federation of American Scientists, noted that Kiriakou is accused of being a source on stories about CIA interrogation measures that Obama described as torture. “The Justice Department has initiated no prosecutions concerning extreme interrogation methods,” Aftergood said. “But it is now prosecuting an individual who helped bring such events to public light. Is that what we want?” Senior officials inside the U.S. intelligence community, however, have applauded the administration’s aggressive approach. CIA Director David H. Petraeus issued a statement to the agency’s workforce on Monday in which he said that he could not comment on the details of the case against Kiriakou but warned that “the illegal passage of secrets is an abuse of trust that may put lives in jeopardy.” Others targeted in leaks-related cases include Bradley Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst accused of providing thousands of classified files to the WikiLeaks Web site, and Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA analyst suspected of disclosing secrets about CIA operations against Iran. Another case unraveled last year when the government’s most serious charges were dropped in favor of a plea agreement with Thomas Drake, a former executive at the National Security Agency accused of leaking information about failed computer systems and government waste. Kiriakou made a media splash in 2007 when he appeared on ABC News describing the use of waterboarding against al-Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaida, also known as Zayn al-Abidin Muhammed Hussein. After just one session of simulated drowning, Abu Zubaida cracked, Kiriakou claimed, saying “the threat information he provided disrupted . . . maybe dozens of attacks.” But Kiriakou’s credibility was damaged when it emerged that Abu Zubaida had actually been waterboarded at least 83 times. Kiriakou subsequently acknowledged that he had no firsthand knowledge and that he had “relied on what I’d heard and read inside the agency at the time.” The Justice Department alleges that after the ABC News interview Kiriakou continued to serve as a source for other stories, including a lengthy 2008 piece in the New York Times that revealed the name of the CIA’s interrogator of Mohammed. Kiriakou “disclosed or confirmed” the identity of the interrogator to New York Times reporter Scott Shane as well as other journalists, according to the Justice Department filing. Shane declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the New York Times. The Washington Post quoted Kiriaku several times between 2007 and 2009 but Monday’s charges make no reference to Post articles. The Kiriakou investigation appears to have been triggered by a CIA referral to the Justice Department as well as a separate probe into how photographs of CIA operatives ended up in the possession of high-value detainees at Guantanamo Bay in 2009. Investigators believe that defense attorneys obtained the photos after learning the identities of CIA operatives from a journalist who had been in contact with Kiriakou. The photographs, which included shots taken surreptitiously outside CIA employees’ homes, were shown to the detainees as part of an effort by defense attorneys to identify participants in CIA interrogations and potentially call them as witnesses in terrorism trials. In an interview with FBI officials last week, Kiriakou denied disclosing the names of covert officers and expressed dismay that defense attorneys, let alone detainees, had learned CIA officers’ names, according to the Justice Department complaint. The document also cites an e-mail that Kiriakou allegedly sent to the CIA interrogator after the New York Times story was published, denying that he had talked except to warn the reporter that naming the interrogator “might not be illegal” but “would certainly be immoral.” Despite the denials, the Justice Department said, Kiriakou had talked to the reporter extensively and even provided the CIA interrogator’s phone number and personal e-mail address. The Guantanamo defense teams, which included attorneys from the ACLU, have been cleared of any wrongdoing in obtaining or sharing the photos, according to the Justice Department complaint. After leaving the CIA, Kiriakou worked as an investigator on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a year before leaving in 2010.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Last week's horrific massacre of 14 students and three staff members in Parkland, Fla., has reinvigorated the national debate over assault weapons. A Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday, for instance, found that 67 percent of Americans, including 53 percent of gun owners, say they favor such a ban — the highest level of support seen on this question since 20 children and six educators were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Critics of bans on assault weapons, however, say they do little to save lives. The NRA correctly points out that assault weapons are used only in a tiny fraction of gun crimes. The gun rights group also notes that a federally funded study of the previous assault weapons ban, which was in place from 1994 to 2004, concluded that “the ban’s impact on gun violence is likely to be small at best, and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.” Similar points have been made in arguments against a new ban in publications running the ideological gamut from Breitbart to the New York Times to HuffPost. But the 1994 assault weapons ban was never intended to be a comprehensive fix for “gun violence” writ large. Its purpose, according to gun violence experts and the lawmakers who wrote the bill, was to reduce the frequency and lethality of mass shootings like the ones in Parkland, Sandy Hook and elsewhere. And on that front, the data shows it had a significant impact. Louis Klarevas, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts at Boston who wrote a book on mass shooting violence published in 2016, says that the impetus for a federal assault weapons ban came in 1989. That year Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, introduced the original assault weapons ban bill after a gunman armed with an assault rifle killed five children and injured 29 more in a schoolyard in Stockton, Calif. “The guy used an AK-47 variant, with large capacity magazines” capable of holding 10 or more rounds, Klarevas said. The shooting “got a lot of attention” and galvanized public opinion. National polls conducted in the months following, for instance, showed that over 70 percent of Americans supported bans on assault weapons like the one used in Stockton. But Metzenbaum's bill didn't pass, and Congress spent several years debating other assault weapons measures that were less stringent in nature. None of those were ever signed into law. Momentum returned with two back-to-back mass shootings in 1993: one at a San Francisco law firm that killed eight people and injured six more, and another on a Long Island Railroad train that left five dead and 19 wounded. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, architect of the 1994 assault weapons ban, said that “it was the 1993 mass shooting at 101 California Street in San Francisco that was the tipping point for me. That’s what really motivated me to push for a ban on assault weapons.” The San Francisco shooting “made clear that the increasing sophistication of weapons had made it possible for a mass shooter to murder large numbers of people in a matter of minutes,” Feinstein said. “The goal of the ban was to reduce the frequency and deadliness of mass shootings.” The final piece of legislation that we now know as the federal assault weapons ban was signed into law a little over one year after the San Francisco shooting. The 1994 law included a ban on 18 specific models of assault weapons, as well as a ban on any firearms containing certain military-style features, like a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor or a folding stock. It also banned high-capacity magazines capable of holding more than 10 bullets. The bill allowed individuals already in possession of such weapons to keep them. It was also set to expire after 10 years' time. “The original intent of the assault weapons ban was to reduce the carnage of mass shootings,” Klarevas said. “And on that front the data indicate that it worked.” Klarevas has compiled data on gun massacres involving six or more fatalities for the 50 years before 2016. His numbers show that gun massacres fell significantly during the time the assault weapons ban was in place, and skyrocketed after the ban lapsed in 2004. A separate mass shooting database compiled by Mother Jones magazine shows a similar trend. Klarevas wasn't surprised by the 2004 report showing the ban had little effect on overall rates of gun crime. “If there was going to be any benefit on [overall] violent crime, that would have been a pleasant surprise,” he said. But, “the real objective of the assault weapons ban was always to reduce both the frequency and lethality of mass shootings.” Klarevas is particularly concerned about what the numbers show for the years after Congress allowed the assault weapons ban to lapse. Guns like the ones used in Parkland and in other mass shootings are now among the most popular firearms currently on the market. The proliferation of these guns means that would-be mass shooters have little trouble obtaining them. “In the last three years we have had as many gun massacres with assault weapons as in the decade prior,” Klarevas said. “The trend is continuing to escalate.” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old THE MORNING PLUM: Donald Trump is deeply, unshakably convinced that talking about terrorism plays to what he chooses to see as his strengths. Back in March, he explicitly said that his focus on the topic “is probably why I’m number one in the polls.” And his response to the Orlando shooting that claimed 50 lives — the deadliest mass shooting in American history, simultaneously an act of terror and a hate crime — was to unleash a blizzard of public statements congratulating himself for his own perspicacity in gauging the true nature of the terror threat. “Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism,” Trump tweeted, though he modestly added that “I don’t want congrats.” Trump also tweeted, “I called it,” and reiterated his support for a ban on Muslims. And Trump called on Obama to “resign in disgrace” because he won’t use the words “radical Islamic terrorism.” This morning on Fox News, Trump went even further, seeming to insinuate that President Obama is somehow tacitly rooting for terrorist attacks on Americans. He also seemed to try to incite hatred towards Muslims in America. It’s true that talking about terrorism helped Trump among GOP primary voters. But he appears to be incapable of even contemplating the possibility that a general election audience might take a dimmer view of this sort of response. Here’s what Trump said on Fox: For good measure, Trump also said the following this morning: How Ken Burns built his blistering attack on Donald Trump As it was, Trump’s self-congratulatory tweets yesterday had already attracted scalding criticism, even from Republicans. As NBC News reports, “party operatives had hoped Trump would remain silent on the attacks so as not to politicize the tragedy,” but they were “likely disappointed.” Meanwhile, some news reports were already taking note of the vast differences in the ways that Trump and Clinton responded to the event. As the Post overview reports, Trump responded with “bombast,” while Clinton expressed sympathy with the victims, directly addressed the issues raised by the event, and called for a redoubled focus on defeating terror threats. Today this contrast only deepened. As Steve Benen notes, Trump’s latest insinuations about Obama’s intentions towards America may well put pressure on other Republicans to clarify whether they agree with their party’s standard bearer on this matter. Meanwhile, Clinton went on NBC’s Today Show and rejected Trump’s semantic games over whether we should use the phrase “radical Islam.” Instead, she blasted Trump’s “demagoguery,” reiterated that she will not “declare war on an entire religion,” and said Trump’s rhetoric “plays into ISIS’s hands.” It is routinely suggested that the specter of terrorism helps Trump politically. But if anything, Trump’s response to this horrific event could end up raising further doubts about his temperamental fitness for the presidency. As it is, the polling is mixed on whether Trump holds the advantage on these issues: while some surveys show Trump favored on the narrow question of terrorism, others show Clinton favored on foreign policy and on who would be a better commander in chief. Meanwhile, a Pew poll in February found that by 50-40, Americans say the next president should take care not to implicate all of Islam when talking about terrorism. So there is no particular reason to assume at the outset that the general electorate will respond well to Trump’s efforts to whip up xenophobia about American Muslims. Indeed, if anything, Trump’s response calls to mind Mitt Romney’s handling of the Benghazi attacks in 2012. As you may recall, barely hours after the attacks, Romney rushed to blame Obama for allegedly making an “apology for American values,” insinuating vaguely that the president sympathized with anti-American interests throughout the Muslim world. That unleashed a torrent of criticism of Romney’s temperament and leadership abilities amid a crisis. General presidential elections are brutally difficult: Without warning, they serve up moments that pose severe tests to the character and temperament of those vying for the Oval Office, and split-second decisions about how to respond to them end up creating lasting impressions that can prove unshakable. In retrospect, we may look back at Trump’s response to the Orlando shooting as his very own Romney/Benghazi moment — only far worse. Trump just said policy won’t matter in this election. He’s wrong. ********************************************************************************** UPDATE: I’ve edited the above to reflect a fuller quote from one of Trump’s self-congratulatory tweets. ********************************************************************************** * TRUMP PUTS ATTACK ON CLINTONS ON HOLD: Trump had previously said that he would be delivering a speech today attacking both of “the Clintons,” but the Associated Press reports that the Orlando attack has changed his plans: He will instead shift his focus to “further address this terrorist attack, immigration and national security,” according to his campaign. So if you were trembling with excitement at the prospect of hearing Trump’s devastating rehash of dredged up charges about Bill’s womanizing and crazy 1990s conspiracy theories, you’re just going to have to wait. * SANDERS SIGNALS IT’S (PROBABLY) OVER: Bernie Sanders was asked on Meet the Press whether he’s “still an active candidate for president.” His answer: In other words, it’s likely that, once Clinton has given him the assurances he’s looking for, he’ll concede after the D.C. primary. * SANDERS STILL HOPES TO CHANGE THE PARTY: Yesterday Sanders met with his top advisers, and emerged saying this: That means he hopes to channel his movement’s energy into prodding the party to embrace a robust progressive agenda. Also look for some kind of push to reform the nominating process and make it more inclusive. * HILLARY LAUNCHES NEW AD BLASTING TRUMP’S TEMPERAMENT: The Clinton campaign has launched a new minute-long ad that features footage of Trump airing his desire to “knock the crap” out of someone and mocking a disabled reporter, which is contrasted with Clinton’s message that we are “stronger together.” The ad is the latest sign that Democrats are going to spend the next five months portraying Trump as a dangerous sociopath — and that the campaign is going to be a battle over “what kind of America do we want to be,” as the ad puts it. * OMAR MATEEN BOUGHT GUN LEGALLY: NBC News reports that the Orlando shooter was twice investigated by the FBI for possible ties to terrorism but still bought the AR-15-style weapon he used legally: It’s not clear yet, however, whether Mateen was on a terror watch list whose members would be prohibited from getting guns if that bill had become law. Meanwhile, in both cases, the FBI determined he was not a threat. * AND OBAMA GIVES NO GROUND TO CRITICS: Some good points from E.J. Dionne about Obama’s reaction to the Orlando shooting: Yes, it can be both of those things. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "Concepcion Picciotto, the protester who maintained a peace vigil outside the White House for more than three decades, a demonstration widely considered to be the longest-running act of political protest in U.S. history, died Jan. 25 at a housing facility operated by N Street Village, a nonprofit that supports homeless women in Washington. She was believed to be 80. She had recently suffered a fall, but the immediate cause of death was not known, said Schroeder Stribling, the shelter’s executive director. Ms. Picciotto — a Spanish immigrant known to many as “Connie” or “Conchita” — was the primary guardian of the anti-nuclear-proliferation vigil stationed along Pennsylvania Avenue. [Connie Picciotto has kept vigil near the White House for decades. Why, and at what cost?] In a 2013 profile in The Washington Post, Ms. Picciotto said she spent more than 30 years of her life outside the White House “to stop the world from being destroyed.” Through her presence, she said she hoped to remind others to take whatever action they could, however small, to help end wars and stop violence, particularly against children. Ms. Picciotto, a diminutive woman perpetually clad in a helmet and headscarf, was a curious and at times controversial figure in Washington. Fellow activists lauded her as a heroine. Critics and even casual passersby, reading her hand-lettered signs, dismissed her as foolish, perhaps unwell. Ms. Picciotto was quick to share elaborate accounts of persecution by the government, which she considered responsible for many of her physical ailments. Ellen Thomas, a demonstrator who protested alongside Ms. Picciotto for decades, told The Post in 2013 that the truth was somewhere in between. She acknowledged that there were “issues that haven’t been addressed” where Ms. Picciotto’s mental health was concerned but lauded her dedication and stamina. Ms. Picciotto spoke little of her life before 1960, when she emigrated to New York City and worked as a receptionist for the economic and commercial office of the Spanish Embassy. She met an Italian man who became her husband in 1969, with whom she adopted an infant daughter, she said. Ms. Picciotto first came to the White House in 1979, she said, after she came to believe that her husband had orchestrated an illegal adoption and arranged to have Ms. Picciotto separated from their child and committed. She believed she was the target of a web of conspiracies — involving doctors, lawyers and the government — and hoped that elected officials could help get her daughter back. But that never happened. Ms. Picciotto said she last saw the child when the girl was a toddler. She had just given up on reconnecting with her daughter when she met William Thomas, a self-described wanderer, philosopher and peace activist who founded the peace vigil along Pennsylvania Avenue. Ms. Picciotto joined Thomas there in 1981 — since she could not help her own child, she said, she wanted to do what she could to help other children — and the two became a fixture in the park. They were joined in 1984 by Ellen Benjamin, who soon married Thomas. The budding romance sparked hostility from Ms. Picciotto, who questioned Ellen Thomas’s motives for joining the protest and believed the new woman was after William Thomas’s money. But despite that perpetual tension, Ellen Thomas told The Post, the trio protested together in the park for 25 years. The group’s grass-roots nuclear disarmament campaign was known as Proposition One, and its crowning achievement came in 1993, when a nuclear disarmament petition circulated by the activists resulted in a ballot initiative passed by District voters. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District’s congressional delegate, helped the activists prepare a nuclear disarmament and conversion act, which she has since introduced in nearly a dozen sessions of Congress. The legislation has never reached the floor for a vote. Norton told The Post in 2013 that although the value of the vigil’s presence could not be readily quantified, it has served as an important and ongoing reminder to all who passed by. “They want to keep the issue of nuclear proliferation and its potential terrible consequences before the public,” Norton said of the protesters. “And they have chosen a prime spot to do it. . . . We won’t ever know what the success is, because it doesn’t have a specific end of the kind we are used to.” From their rudimentary encampment on the red-brick walkway in Lafayette Square, the protesters demonstrated against wars and military conflicts, survived historic blizzards and scorching heat waves, and endured tense confrontations with passersby and police. The vigil evolved into a well-recognized feature of the city’s landscape. The makeshift shelter became a regular stop for D.C. tour guides and a topic of discussion in local college classrooms. The vigil and its keepers made a cameo appearance in Michael Moore’s 2004 political documentary film “Fahrenheit 9/11” and starred in another feature-length documentary, “The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue” (2011). When Thomas died in 2009, Ms. Picciotto vowed to continue her protest in his honor. But the vigil’s future was called into question in recent years, as its aging caretaker faced health problems and the possibility of eviction from the home she shared with other activists in Northwest Washington. After Ms. Picciotto was hit by a cab in 2012 while riding her bicycle, she came to rely heavily on the help of younger activists to maintain the vigil, which could not be left unattended, according to National Park Service rules. For months, the activists — many of whom lived with Ms. Picciotto at Peace House, a rowhouse owned by Ellen Thomas — took turns guarding the vigil, allowing Ms. Picciotto to scale back her watch to just a few hours each day. But on two occasions in recent years, activists abandoned their station during overnight shifts, and the shelter and its signs were quickly removed by police. In both instances, the station and its signs were later returned by authorities. Peace House was sold last year,, and Ms. Picciotto eventually found shelter at N Street Village, within walking distance of her vigil. “I have to be here,” she said of her work. “This is my life.” Read more Washington Post obituaries : From Lafayette Square Lookout, He Made His War Protest Permanent Stephanie Rader, American spy in postwar Europe, dies at 100 Henry Worsley, British explorer attempting solo crossing of Antarctica, dies 30 miles from goal We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.",

        "articles": "“You know, Nazis were the National Socialist Party. Just like the Democrats are now a national socialist party.” — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), speaking at an “America First” rally, May 27 Those who apparently do not know history are doomed to make basic mistakes. It seems so simple. The official name of the Adolf Hitler’s political party — the Nazis — had the word “socialist” in it. Ergo, it must have been a socialist party. And that means that Democrats, some of whom call themselves socialists, must be Nazis. Or something like that. Greene is not the first Republican lawmaker to make this facile observation. So here’s a quick history lesson. (The video above also provides a useful primer on socialism.) The full name of Hitler’s party was Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei. In English, that translates to National Socialist German Workers’ Party. But it was not a socialist party; it was a right-wing, ultranationalist party dedicated to racial purity, territorial expansion and anti-Semitism — and total political control. Let’s take a look at the first eight of the “25 points” in the 1920 Nazi party platform. As Ronald Granieri of the Foreign Policy Research Institute has noted, in that platform there are also passages denouncing banks, department stores and “interest slavery.” That could be seen as “a quasi-Marxist rejection of free markets. But these were also typical criticisms in the anti-Semitic playbook, which provided a clue that the party’s overriding ideological goal wasn’t a fundamental challenge to private property.” The Nazi party was largely supported by small-business men and conservative industrialists, not the proletariat. Still, left-wing parties such as the Communists and Social Democrats were major parties in 1920s Germany so the inclusion of “socialist” in the party’s name was attractive to working-class voters who might also be anti-Semitic. Hitler adamantly rejected socialist ideas, dismantled or banned left-leaning parties and disapproved of trade unions. In many countries, trade unions played important roles in socialist movements or helped launch political movements that eventually adopted socialist platforms. In fact, one of the most famous quotes of that era, enshrined on a wall at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, is by Martin Niemöller, a prominent Lutheran pastor who spent seven years in Nazi concentration camps. His words provide a flavor of what the Nazis thought about socialists. [Update: Some readers pointed out there are different versions of Niemöller’s quote, as he said it at various times after the war. The New England Holocaust Memorial, for instance, substitutes communists for socialists and adds Catholics. This history — critical of the version on the wall in Washington — says that Niemöller generally mentioned communists and Jews and then in the middle rotated socialists, Social Democrats or trade unionists.] We sought comment from a Taylor spokesman but did not get a response. We suggest Greene brush up on her history of the Nazi party. It was not a “socialist” party and cannot be compared, either in the United States or in Europe, to today’s socialists.

        "articles": "Some good news for President Biden from an unexpected source this week: Polling from Fox News put his approval rating at 56 percent. That’s above the president’s current average, as calculated by FiveThirtyEight, and, while not historically jaw-dropping, it is noteworthy in a deeply polarized political moment. It’s largely a function of three things. The first is overwhelming support from Democrats, 60 percent of whom approve of him strongly and more than 9-in-10 who approve at least somewhat. The second is that a majority of independents at least somewhat approve of his performance. The third, and perhaps most unexpected, is that a fifth of Republicans say they at least somewhat approve — including 13 percent of those who also say they voted for former president Donald Trump last year. Those are striking results in the details. But if you are an avid consumer of Fox News’s programming and online content, you’d be forgiven for not having heard about them. On Thursday morning, I noticed that the results, released Wednesday evening, didn’t appear on the Fox News homepage. Instead, there was a text link to a story about the poll generally, focused on a different question that dealt with the coronavirus pandemic. That story by Fox News’ Dana Blanton does include the Biden approval number — literally the last line in the story. Blanton, whose title is senior vice president of public opinion research, is often the byline on Fox polling stories. She has another one from this same poll, focused on the public’s concerns about inflation and the economy. In the middle of that story was a more detailed breakdown of Biden’s approval numbers, as well as a quote from one of the pollsters who conducted the research. “In looking at public opinion data on recent presidents, Biden’s approval numbers are fairly average for someone at this stage of the first term,” said Daron Shaw, the Republican pollster from Fox’s bipartisan polling team. Shaw added that Biden “scores slightly better than George W. Bush and Donald Trump,” which somewhat downplays that Trump was polling at 45 percent in Fox’s June 2017 poll. The headline on Blanton’s article then? “Fox News Poll: Record approval of Trump on economy, optimism on North Korea.” Again, though, to learn about this number you’d have to dive deep into one of the site’s articles about its poll. In its last approval poll conducted during Trump’s presidency, it was easier to figure out what the poll said. Blanton wrote an article predicated on public opinion about Trump’s time in office. There’s certainly a difference in the newsworthiness of an assessment of a lame-duck president’s administration and a new president’s first few months, but the difference is still worth noting. Of course, most Fox News fans get their information from the outlet’s television coverage more than its web content. And on that front, the odds that they heard about the Biden number at all are low. Fox polling is often released in concert with Bret Baier’s evening news show, as was this week’s poll. Guest host Bill Hemmer walked through the numbers at the top of the show and then quickly transitioned to an interview with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) that centered on criticism of Biden’s approach to crime. On Thursday afternoon, the approval number came up again — to point out that Biden’s approval on immigration was underwater (meaning that more disapprove than approve) by 13 points. This was centered on Vice President Harris’s visit to the border on Friday. There was another pointed mention of the approval polling. On the popular morning program “Fox & Friends,” the hosts asked one of the network’s contributors about Biden’s apparent popularity. “How do you explain his approval rating, according to Fox’s poll, is 54 percent?” co-host Brian Kilmeade asked, getting the number wrong. “I mean, I truly don’t believe that,” she responded — referring, just to put a fine point on it, to Fox’s own poll. “I don’t think that is a legitimate number.” (Co-host Steve Doocy later added that “Fox News stands by the poll.”) The contributor went on to argue that Biden is getting “coddled” by the media, arguing that “people who tune into those outlets are not getting the full picture on Joe Biden.” That was the assessment of Lara Trump, the former president’s daughter-in-law.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Ja’Mecca Smith was the youngest of seven children, the baby of the family. She loved tic-tac-toe and the Disney movie “Frozen” and the color red. She was a member of the first grade honor roll, a cheerful little girl with a sense of humor and a gap-toothed smile. But police say a combination of negligence, a child’s curiosity and cruel circumstance ended her life Saturday, when Ja’Mecca accidentally shot herself in the head with a loaded gun she found tucked between the cushions of a sofa in her father’s home. According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, police arrived at Ja’Mecca’s father’s Atlanta apartment Saturday morning to find the 6-year-old dead and her father gone. Authorities said the father, 25-year-old Demarqo Smith, briefly fled the apartment before returning to speak with police. Smith was arrested Sunday and charged with involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct, according to Fulton County Jail records. [People are getting shot by toddlers on a weekly basis this year] “Right now my life is in shambles,” Kate Milling, Ja’Mecca’s mother, told WALB at a vigil Sunday night. “It’s hard and it hurts. I lost my baby girl and I’m upset.” Miller was not at the apartment when her daughter died. The Journal Constitution reported that Smith, another adult and at least four other children were present at the time of the shooting. “He really loved his child and he’s really hurting, too. A piece of him is gone, too,” Yakita Daniels, a friend of Smith’s, told WALB. “It was a harsh accident but it was an honest accident.” Ja’Mecca is the third Georgia child to be killed in an accidental shooting in the past month. In mid-November, Jackson 2-year-old Jayden Jamar Clay accidentally shot and killed himself with a gun that belonged to his mother’s boyfriend. Less than three weeks before that, another 2-year-old in Acworth, Ga., died after accidentally shooting himself with a semi-automatic handgun that had been left on a bed, police said. “The fact that a child got a gun isn’t an accident, that’s negligence,” Viviana Goldenberg, a member of the Georgia chapter of Moms Demand Action, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution after Clay’s death. “It’s literally terrifying, and this is happening all over the country,” she continued. “There is no gun owner responsibility. They’re not thinking of what measures to do to prevent access of the children to the gun.” According to the Centers For Disease Control’s WONDER database, 69 children under the age of 15 died from accidental gunshots in 2013, the last year for which data is available. But the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety says that its own review of accidental gun deaths revealed a number that was almost twice as high: It found 100 children had been killed in unintentional shootings between December 2012 and December 2013. Most of the deaths took place in a home or vehicle belonging to the victim’s family and involved guns that were legally owned but not secured. The group said that roughly 70 percent of cases might have been avoided if the gun had been stored locked and unloaded. About 2 million American children live in homes with unsecured guns. A Washington Post investigation this year found 43 instances where people were shot by 1, 2 and 3-year-olds (not all of them deadly) from January though mid October. The National Rifle Association, which opposes mandatory storage and trigger lock legislation, argues that education and training has brought down the number of fatal accidents. “So-called safe storage laws have nothing to do with safety, they merely serve as a tool for gun control politicians to disarm law-abiding gun owners,” NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told the L.A. Times this August, after the Los Angeles City Council passed legislation mandating that handguns be locked up or disabled inside homes. The details about the gun involved in Ja’Mecca Smith’s death are still unclear. Family members have set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for the 6-year-old’s funeral expenses. “She was the star that [shined] the brightest,” it said.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old The Post delivered another bombshell report just as Democratic and Republican senators departed for the holidays, still at loggerheads about whether a rule would guarantee the ability to introduce documents and witnesses at the Senate’s impeachment trial: The report continues: “One former senior White House official said Trump even stated so explicitly at one point, saying he knew Ukraine was the real culprit because ‘Putin told me.’ Two other former officials said the senior White House official described Trump’s comment to them.” In short, “The concern among senior White House officials that Putin helped fuel Trump’s theories about Ukraine underscores long-standing fears inside the administration about the Russian president’s ability to influence Trump’s views.” Finally, \"Three former senior administration officials said Trump repeatedly insisted after the G-20 summit that he believed Putin’s assurances that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 campaign. The officials said [chief of staff John] Kelly, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson all tried to caution Trump not to rely on Putin’s word, and to focus on evidence to the contrary that U.S. intelligence agencies had collected.” The latest Trump impeachment updates So where are these former officials? As a preliminary matter, the thought processes of those former senior officials — who would anonymously say that Trump was a Putin puppet but refuse to come forward to provide testimony well before we even got to an impeachment proceeding, in part about Trump’s alleged betrayal of national security — boggles the mind. They have either given cover to a president who is practically a foreign asset, or they are creating unwarranted fear that he is. There could be no better example as to why the Senate must be able to subpoena former officials for the impeachment trial and obtain documents Trump has concealed under a spurious absolute immunity defense. If a former secretary of state or a defense, homeland security or senior intelligence official (e.g., director of national intelligence, head of the National Security Agency) cannot do the patriotic thing when the security of the country is at stake, then it is essential to end the Trump coverup and figure out how to force their appearance in the Senate trial. “If it is true that Trump was literally repeating talking points given to him by Putin, then it raises even more questions about his behavior and we need all of the White House records the House has asked for in order to have a fair trial,\" former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller told me. Former prosecutor Joyce White Vance explained: “Russia’s goal has always been to disrupt our country and our way of life. Now, we’ve had more confirmation they seem to be succeeding, with confirmation of what’s been long suspected, that our president’s national security briefings come from Putin, not our own intelligence community.” She cautioned: “This could form the basis for another article of impeachment — a president who doesn’t put our national security ahead of all other concerns.” At the very least, it would shed additional light on the existing Article I that concerns Trump’s otherwise inexplicable obsession with debunked conspiracy theories that brought him to extort an ally at war with Russia. As noted, on Thursday the Senate recessed, with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) insisting that there be no agreement on the admission of witnesses and documents in advance, but rather that these would be handled as they come up. McConnell said that is how it has always worked. However, it has never been the case that the majority leader conspired with the president or that senators declared they had no intention to be fair. Under these circumstances, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) seems entirely justified in holding back the articles of impeachment until this can be resolved. McConnell talks tough by insisting that he does not want the trial anyway. However, Trump (to whom McConnell evidently thinks he reports) seems frantic to get the clean bill of health from a sham trial. Pelosi and other Democrats would do well to turn up the heat on Senate Republicans who present themselves as beacons of moderation and fairness. It is time for Democrats to point the finger directly at Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and others. Do they want to be part of a sham that risks leaving in place Putin’s pawn? The holidays are a good time to reflect on things that matter — family, friends and country. Maybe these Republicans will find it within their own consciences and heed the words of House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). “All of us feel a sense of loyalty to party. It’s what makes our two-party system function. . . . But party loyalty must have its limits,” he said. “And as evidence of the President’s impeachable offenses has mounted, it has become increasingly clear that the limits of partisanship have been reached and passed. . . . Democrats and Republicans together face a test before our constituents, our countrymen, and our Creator.” Hoyer ended: The key Republican senators can do this by ending the logjam, vowing to vote for key witnesses, including current and past national security advisers, and demanding relevant documents. If they cannot do this bare minimum, you really have to question why they bother running and serving in the Senate.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Hillary Clinton spent an hour talking to CNN's Anderson Cooper and a handful of New Hampshire voters in a town hall on Wednesday night. For 59 minutes of it, she was excellent — empathetic, engaged and decidedly human. But, then there was that other minute — really just four words — that Clinton is likely to be haunted by for some time to come. \"That’s what they offered,\" Clinton said in response to Cooper's question about her decision to accept $675,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in the period between serving as secretary of state and her decision to formally enter the 2016 presidential race. The line is, well, bad. More on that soon. But, the line when combined with her body language when she said it makes it politically awful for her. Here's the full video. Clinton is both seemingly caught by surprise and annoyed by the question all at once. Neither of those is a good reaction to what Cooper is asking. Both together make for a uniquely bad response. Here's the thing: I'm not sure there is a great answer, politically speaking, for Clinton on the question of her acceptance of huge speaking fees from all sorts of groups — from colleges and universities to investment banks. She took the money because these groups were willing to pay it. And who wouldn't do the same thing in her shoes? Clinton, Sanders talk meaning of 'progressive' in first one-on-one debate The problem is that you can't say that if you are the front-running candidate for the Democratic nomination, a front-runner facing a more-serious-than-expected challenge from a populist liberal who has made your ties to Wall Street a centerpiece of his campaign. So, yes, Clinton was in something of a box when Cooper put the Goldman question to her. But, let's not let her off so easily. Are you telling me that Clinton and her team had no idea that the speaking fees, which Bernie Sanders put into an ad in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, might come up in the course of an hour-long conversation in New Hampshire? If so (and I don't believe this to be the case), that's total political malpractice. Rather, I think what happened is something similar to Clinton's reaction during a testy exchange a few months ago with reporters over her email server: She got annoyed and freelanced. The server and the speaking fees are two story lines that Clinton clearly believes are ridiculous. Sure, she shouldn't have used only a private email address and server while serving as secretary of state. But that error was a small one, not the sort of huge deal that Republicans and the media are trying to turn it into. And, sure, $675,000 is a lot of money to take for speeches but she is a former first lady, senator and secretary of state. It's not out of the ballpark that someone with that résumé would be compensated at such high levels. That's what Clinton truly believes. And she's not good — as she made plain with her answer last night — at hiding her disdain/skepticism when questioned about it. But, politics is all about playing up your strengths and taking attention away from your weaknesses. The amount of money Hillary and Bill Clinton made from speech-giving — more than $25 million in 16 months — is a weakness. Period. It undercuts the idea that she is a committed fighter for wage equality or a voice of the 99 percent trying to level the playing field with the one percent. In short: Clinton needs to find a WAY better answer to questions about her speaking fees than \"that's what they offered.\" And soon.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Just a few months ago, President Trump grew frustrated during a meeting in the Oval Office about protections for immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and African countries and asked, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” The African Union condemned the remark at the time. On Monday, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari became the first of its members to visit the Trump White House. “Did you address his reported comments from earlier this year, when he reportedly used vulgar language to describe African nations?” Jordan Fabian of the Hill asked Buhari during a joint news conference. Buhari's response showcased one possible effect of Trump's “fake news” refrain. “Well,” Buhari began, “I’m very careful with what the press says about others than myself. I’m not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation against the president was true or not. So the best thing for me is to keep quiet.” Trump’s ‘fake news’ mantra becomes an effective weapon — against America If he truly doubts that Trump made the statement, partly in reference to African countries, then Buhari may be one of the few. Even the White House initially did not dispute The Washington Post’s report on the comment in January. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), who attended the meeting, told reporters, “I cannot believe that in the history of the White House, in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday.” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), another attendee, also seemed to confirm Trump's remark when he said in a statement that “following comments by the president, I said my piece directly to him.” Trump’s media boosters generally accepted The Post’s report but defended the president’s remark as the kind of unvarnished rhetoric that got him elected. Later, however, Trump denied saying the word. The Post’s Josh Dawsey subsequently reported that there is disagreement within the White House about whether Trump said “shithole” or “shithouse.” The latter might not be any less offensive but would make Trump’s denial technically accurate. Perhaps Buhari believes Trump’s denial. In that case, it is possible that Trump is successfully convincing world leaders that U.S. media accounts are often fake. More likely, Buhari decided that a confrontation was not worthwhile. “Security is the main issue,” he said during a photo op before a private meeting with Trump. “We are very grateful to the United States for agreeing to give us the aircraft we asked for — the spare parts. We are even more grateful for the physical presence of the United States military.” Between the photo op and the news conference, Buhari had precisely 84 minutes with Trump. Why spend any of them on a subject that could send a meeting off the rails? Trump’s propensity for denials is so strong that he could not help but chime in during the news conference, even though he was not asked about the comment. “We didn’t discuss it,” Trump said. “And you do have some countries that are in very bad shape and very tough places to live in. But we didn’t discuss it because the president knows me, and he knows where I’m coming from, and I appreciate that. We did not discuss it.” Had Buhari gone there, Trump might have eaten up precious meeting time. Instead, Buhari put a smile on Trump's face by questioning the “validity” of the reporting. Trump has attempted to bond with other world leaders over “fake news.” Just last week, French President Emmanuel Macron addressed Congress and included a denunciation of “fake news” that could have been interpreted as an overture to Trump, who Macron said deserves “the fair copyright for this expression.” Buhari may be the latest head of state to recognize that throwing a shot at the media is one way to get on Trump’s good side.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Stephen K. Bannon, who was ousted as White House chief strategist last summer but has remained in touch with some members of President Trump’s circle, is pitching a plan to West Wing aides and congressional allies to cripple the federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to four people familiar with the discussions. The first step, these people say, would be for Trump to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who oversees the work of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and in recent days signed off on a search warrant of Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. Bannon is also recommending the White House cease its cooperation with Mueller, reversing the policy of Trump’s legal team to provide information to the special counsel’s team and to allow staff members to sit for interviews. And he is telling associates inside and outside the administration that the president should create a new legal battleground to protect himself from the investigation by asserting executive privilege — and arguing that Mueller’s interviews with White House officials over the past year should now be null and void. “The president wasn’t fully briefed by his lawyers on the implications” of not invoking executive privilege, Bannon told The Washington Post in an interview Wednesday. “It was a strategic mistake to turn over everything without due process, and executive privilege should be exerted immediately and retroactively.” There is no indication that Trump, who forced out Bannon and later said his former adviser had “lost his mind” after leaving the West Wing, would be willing to take Bannon’s advice or is aware of the plan. Several Trump aides also remain skeptical of the former strategist’s attempt to insert himself into the president’s decision-making process. “If you say his name in front of the president, it’s not a pretty sight,” said a senior administration official. “The president really goes off about him.” Nonetheless, Bannon’s efforts signify the growing pressure from an influential wing of Trump’s political base to thwart Mueller, who, many Trump allies believe, presents an existential legal and political threat to his presidency. Trump boosters in Congress are preparing to take legislative action against Rosenstein and other Justice officials over the disclosure of documents related to the Russia investigation. That push is seen by Bannon and others in the White House as a cause that could prompt Trump to act and shift much of the Russia investigation to Capitol Hill, where Republicans control both chambers. Trump remains furious with the Mueller probe, which on Wednesday he blasted on Twitter as “never ending and corrupt.” He has also considered firing Rosenstein, whom he has criticized for approving surveillance applications of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, which extended a warrant that partly relied on information that was funded in a roundabout way by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Bannon and his allies sense that Trump simply needs a nudge to fire Rosenstein, according to the people familiar with Bannon’s discussions. They said Trump has recently told friends and aides that he is willing to engage in political warfare in the coming months to stop his presidency from being consumed by the investigation. Bannon’s conversations, including a meeting Tuesday night between the former strategist and Trump confidants, have so far remained through back channels. The 64-year-old strategist has huddled in recent days — at his Capitol Hill townhouse, a Washington hotel and over the phone — with a handful of White House aides, GOP lawmakers and conservative media figures who speak frequently with Trump, according to people involved, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Bannon’s standing within Trump’s orbit is tenuous. In January, lawyers for Trump accused Bannon of breaking a confidentiality agreement by making critical comments about Trump and his family in “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” by Michael Wolff. Ever since, Bannon has seen his domestic political operation — which was focused on the 2018 midterm elections — fizzle, and his attention has turned abroad to boosting far-right nationalist candidates in Europe, giving speeches and promoting his hard-line views on global affairs. Amid all of that activity, he has regularly spoken with White House officials and lawmakers about Trump and offered informal guidance on issues such as trade and the Russia investigation. Bannon, who has been interviewed extensively by Mueller’s team, remains sensitive about directly approaching Trump with his call to fire Rosenstein and curb Justice’s grip over the Russia probe, the people added, noting that federal investigators could raise questions about such exchanges. Some top Trump advisers, such as White House counsel Donald McGahn, are said to be alarmed by the suggestions to fire Rosenstein or Mueller, worrying that such moves could prompt mass resignations at Justice and a constitutional crisis, the people said. ­McGahn, who in the past has threatened to step down if the president fired Mueller, is widely seen within the West Wing as liable to resign if Rosenstein is fired. “A guy leaning on a mop over at the Justice Department may be the guy who ends up firing Mueller,” one person said. Asked Wednesday afternoon whether Trump would be pushing out Rosenstein, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “I don’t have any personnel announcements.” But she offered no words of support for Rosenstein, signaling that the deputy attorney general’s job may be in jeopardy. Later Wednesday, a White House spokesman pointed to Huckabee Sanders’s news conference when asked for comment about Bannon. Legal experts are dubious about Bannon’s idea that the White House could suddenly claim executive privilege on interviews that were given voluntarily by officials and be able to exclude them from an investigation that is partly reliant on those interviews. They also wonder if this action would even be allowed under the law and are certain it would be challenged in court. But Bannon believes Trump can argue he was given poor counsel by his lawyers on Russia, including Ty Cobb, who has encouraged a cooperative approach to Mueller’s team. “Ty Cobb should be fired immediately,” Bannon said. Cobb declined to comment. The case against Rosenstein has featured prominently in the closed-door discussions among Bannon and other figures on the right, with Bannon arguing that voters in the GOP base will stick by the president if he removes Rosenstein despite protests from Republican leaders and many others. Rosenstein’s approval of the Cohen warrant, which led to raids Monday on Cohen’s home and office, has angered Trump and prompted him to vent over the past day about Rosenstein being “out of control,” one Republican lawmaker said. If Rosenstein were fired, his replacement could reel in the authority that Mueller was granted last year and set new parameters for the scope of the Russia investigation, according to Louis Seidman, a constitutional-law professor at Georgetown University. “Depending on how aggressive this person wanted to be, they could dismiss the criminal cases, they could get rid of the grand jury,” Seidman said. “In the end, if Trump is determined, the people he appoints could shut it down.” For Bannon, this hostility to Mueller represents an evolution. A year ago, he opposed the firing of then-FBI Director James B. Comey and recommended a hands-off approach to the Russia investigation and Justice. “I have the utmost respect for Bob Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but the developments over the past two weeks make it the right time to shift the center of gravity of this back to Capitol Hill,” Bannon said. “Make the Republican Party own this, force them to have his back.” Philip Rucker, Ashley Parker, Karoun Demirjian, Carol D. Leonnig, Matt Zapotosky and Philip Bump contributed to this report. The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old For the first time on record, Americans are as likely to die by a gunshot as in a traffic accident, according to new federal data. Gun deaths now outnumber vehicle deaths in 21 states and the District of Columbia. That was true in just two states a decade ago, Alaska and Maryland. The trend was driven largely by the sharp drop in the rate of traffic fatalities, a result of a series of laws and safety measures aimed at making driving safer. Gun homicide rates also have fallen in recent years, but have been offset by the rising prevalence of suicides. Today, suicides account for roughly two out of every three gun deaths. Frank McGeorge, an emergency medicine physician who works midnight shifts at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, said he has seen a big change in the types of cases he gets over his 25 years in medicine. “Cars are safer. Diagnoses and treatments have improved, with regard to accidents,” McGeorge said. “At the same time, guns are not any safer. There has been no change in the speed at which a 9 mm bullet travels; no change in the size of a 9 mm bullet.” Based on steady trends in recent years, public health experts have for some time expected gun deaths to catch up with traffic deaths. The 2014 rates were reported this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Medical ailments, like cancer and heart attacks, kill considerably more people each year than either guns or automobiles, according to the CDC. But firearms and motor vehicles are among the leading non-medical causes of mortality in the U.S., killing more people than falls and considerably more people than alcohol. Guns and traffic accidents each killed about 34,000 people in the U.S. last year, or about 93 people per day. The rate at which Americans are killed in traffic accidents has dropped by more than half since the late 1960s. That decline can be attributed to a combination of improved technology, smarter regulation, and improved care in the hospital. The federal government mandated the presence of seat belts in the 1960s. The ‘70s brought anti-lock brakes. The ‘80s saw a rise in anti-drunk driving advocacy and mandatory seat belt use. Then airbags came along in the '90s. More recent years have seen mandates on electronic stability systems that help prevent vehicles from spinning out and increased penalties for distracted driving. Brian Schaeffer, assistant chief of fire department in Spokane, Wash., said simple changes to highway engineering, such as erecting a physical divider between two lanes of traffic on a highway, also have dramatically improved chances of survival. In the 1990s, Schaeffer said he regularly saw penetrating traumas or amputations in car collisions and routinely needed the Jaws of Life to extricate people from deadly accident scenes. “We’d just have horrible trauma, something you’d probably would only see in a battlefield,” Schaeffer said. Now, when responding to a high-speed crash, first responders often find the passengers and drivers walking around, he said. On gun deaths, the story has been more complicated. Fatalities declined precipitously during the 1990s, but have plateaued since then. While gun homicides have continued to decline, suicides have risen. Those divergent trends reflect two different pictures of gun violence in the U.S. Black Americans are significantly more likely to be victims of homicide, but just one in five black households have guns. White Americans are more than twice as likely to have guns in their homes and they experience gun violence largely through suicides. Richard Reeves, a Brookings researcher who studies inequality, said the differences in how guns affect black and white Americans speak to the need to “think multidimensionally” about the problem. “The nature of those deaths are hugely different,” he said. Opponents and supporters of gun rights often “need to be honest that one blanket solution will not solve the problem.” The history of regulations on guns has been erratic. Restrictions passed in earlier eras, like the assault weapons ban, have been undone recently in the face of strong political opposition. During the Bush administration, Congress passed laws that prohibited law enforcement from releasing data that shows where criminals obtained their guns and granted gunmakers immunity from some civil lawsuits. Technological advances, like smart-gun technology that prevents people other than the owner from firing a gun, have been stymied by opposition from the National Rifle Association and from many gun owners. Even regulatory changes that enjoy overwhelming support from the American public, like universal background checks, have been thwarted. Congress has a longstanding ban on many types of federal gun research, which has affected not only federal agencies like the CDC, but also academic researchers. Garen Wintemute of University of California-Davis had to donate $1 million of his own money to keep his research going. He estimates that there are only a dozen full-time gun violence researchers in the U.S. On the other hand, government and the auto industry have all invested in research, generating a lot of information on how cars crash and improvements in highway safety. “Tell me a scenario on how you crashed your car and I can almost always tell you what your injuries are without even looking at you,” said Babak Sarani, director of trauma and acute care surgery at the George Washington University Hospital. But limited research funding has restricted innovations in gun safety and the development of policies that can improve gun safety and reduce firearm deaths. “We made an important difference with motor vehicle-related violence, and we chose not to do that with firearms,” Wintemute said. “This is the result.” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old A decision Monday by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan to not campaign with or defend Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump through the November election sparked a public feud with his party’s standard-bearer within a matter of hours, suggesting that a widening split within the GOP could reverberate long after the presidential race is decided. Ryan’s move — and a blunt assessment of the race that he and other congressional leaders delivered during a conference call with House GOP lawmakers Monday morning — underscored the perilous choice Republican officials now face in the wake of Friday’s release of a 2005 videotape in which Trump made lewd comments about women: They can remain in line with their nominee, which would please their base but could alienate swing voters critical to maintaining their hold on Congress. Or they could renounce Trump and offend Republicans eager for a direct confrontation with Hillary Clinton and her husband. For his part, the speaker — who canceled an appearance with Trump after the videotape surfaced Friday — did neither. He won’t publicly campaign with Trump, but he also did not rescind his endorsement of his party’s controversial nominee or back away from his pledge to vote for him. One GOP lawmaker said Ryan (R-Wis.) was confronted on the call by at least a half-dozen members from districts ranging from California to Ohio who bristled at any attempt to distance the party from Trump. “He got huge pushback like I’ve never seen before from members from across the country just saying that was the wrong move — and even if it cost them the House,” said one lawmaker on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the private discussion. Late in the call, after several members had criticized GOP leaders, Ryan got back on the line to assure them that he was not planning to rescind his endorsement. But that appeared to do little to assure the pro-Trump contingent. “A number of people said: You can’t have it both ways. You’ve either got to get out and be wholly supportive . . . or it really doesn’t matter,” the GOP lawmaker said. The lawmaker, who represents a safe Republican district where Trump is popular, told The Washington Post that he had heard much the same from his own constituents: “They’re just so fed up with Washington, D.C., that all the rest of this stuff is a side point. . . . They’re willing to overlook a whole lot to try to take back the country.” But Rep. Charlie Dent — a moderate who does not support Trump — also spoke up on the call, saying, “Our nominee should step aside, though I realize it is probably logistically impractical at this moment.” Dent said he warned his fellow Republicans: “Does anyone on the call not think there are worse revelations to come? I would be shocked if there were not more revelations, and what’s our plan when the next one hits?” Trump lashed out at Ryan on Monday, tweeting that the speaker “should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee.” Within a matter of minutes, more than 6,300 people had favorited the tweet. The widening chasm between GOP establishment leaders and Trump, who is now emboldened given his assertive debate performance Sunday night, has moved the party into uncharted territory in the final weeks of an already volatile and unpredictable presidential contest. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, and his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, took to the airwaves Monday to make it clear that Trump intends to remain on the offensive for the duration of the campaign. And Trump’s senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, tweeted that “nothing’s changed” after the congressional call, because his candidate has always been a Washington outsider. And in an interview Monday, former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a close ally of Trump’s, said his performance would make it more difficult for Republicans to abandon him. “They’ve really raised the ante on Republicans who want to cut and run,” he said. “How can you have watched that debate without knowing he won?” After distancing himself from Trump, Pence returns to defending him Some Republican lawmakers, such as Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (Calif.), questioned during the conference call Monday why GOP leaders hesitate to back Trump, citing Clinton’s weakness as a candidate. In an email Monday, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said that “there is no update on [the speaker’s] position at this time” in regards to endorsing Trump. But she added, “The speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities.” In withdrawing his public support from Trump, Ryan is essentially giving other Republican lawmakers license to do the same if they oppose Trump’s statements and are concerned about their reelection chances. After the 2005 video emerged, Ryan said he was “disgusted” by Trump’s comments but did not withdraw his support. “You all need to do what’s best for you and your district,” Ryan said on the conference call, according to two participants who spoke anonymously because of the private nature of the call. With this move, Ryan at least partially joined a growing group of high-profile Republican lawmakers who have renounced their support of Trump following the disclosure Friday by The Post of an 11-year-old videotape of the businessman talking casually about kissing and groping women. That group includes Sens. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and John McCain (Ariz.), both in tough reelection races, and Rep. Jason Chaffetz (Utah). Republicans who participated in the post-debate conference call Monday morning are becoming increasingly worried about their chances of holding on to their 30-seat House majority as Trump lags dangerously behind Clinton in the polls. One described the tone of the call as “nervous.” An NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey released Monday showed Trump taking a big dip after the release of the videotape, with Clinton leading Trump by double digits among likely voters, 46 percent to 35 percent, in a four-way contest. Democrats had a seven-point lead on the question of which party voters would like to see control Congress. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the House GOP campaign arm, briefed lawmakers on the House battlegrounds, warning that the “ground is shifting,” according to a lawmaker on the call. Walden said that Republicans should continue to poll their races and that winning would be equivalent to “landing an airplane in a hurricane: You have to trust the instruments.” The speaker plans to spend the next month, he told lawmakers on the conference call, “only campaigning for House seats and not . . . to promote or defend Trump,” according to a GOP lawmaker. Ryan plans to campaign in 17 states and 42 cities in October to help preserve his majority. One member who spoke out during the call — Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio), a low-key lawmaker who represents struggling industrial areas along the eastern Ohio River — issued a statement late Monday saying he would “continue to support the top of our Republican ticket” while also saying he would “continue to admire and support Speaker Ryan’s leadership in a very challenging time.” “I am a husband, father of two daughters, and I have four granddaughters,” he said. “And, while I find Donald Trump’s locker room comments from ten years ago offensive, indefensible and regrettable, they don’t change the fact that Hillary Clinton has proven she’ll put personal politics over our national security. Ryan embarks on whirlwind tour to help save his majority The House GOP call was an opportunity for members to check in after a chaotic weekend in which dozens of GOP lawmakers revoked their support for Trump after the release of the video. Lawmakers spent the weekend fielding a barrage of questions about their support for Trump, without any formal guidance from party leaders. Ryan typically holds weekly sessions for his members, referring to the confabs as “family meetings” where members are invited to speak their minds. The meetings have become a mainstay for a House GOP that has been plagued by infighting and crises for more than a year. Pence made his first campaign appearance since news of the videotape had broken, telling a group in Charlotte on Monday that it had been “an interesting few days.” He lauded Trump for apologizing during the debate for his vulgar remarks about forcing himself on women in 2005. “It takes a big man to know when he’s wrong and admit it,” said Pence, adding, “Donald Trump last night showed that he’s a big man.” The governor also brought up his Christian faith in his explanation of why he continues to stand by Trump, saying he believes in “grace” and “forgiveness.” Pence made a similar pitch Monday while speaking on Fox News Channel’s “Fox and Friends,” even as he made clear that his former colleagues in Congress should remember that voters, rather than elected officials, will determine who succeeds President Obama. “My hope is that people across the country, including elected officials, believe in redemption as much as I do,” he said. “I’m happy to talk to any of my friends in leadership. But really, this election is really in the hands of the American people.” Democrats suggested that any effort by Republicans to distance themselves from their nominee at this point in the race would not shield them from the repercussions of his candidacy this fall. “I understand why they’re doing that, but Paul Ryan and other leaders in the Republican Party — there was a time where they could have spoken out. That time was this summer. And obviously it’s too late now,” Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters aboard the campaign’s plane Monday while en route to Detroit. “Somewhat of a civil war is breaking out in the Republican Party, but I think that Donald Trump didn’t become the nominee of his party on his own. These leaders help legitimize him and I think they have a lot to answer for, and the voters, I imagine, will hold them accountable.” And even as the actions Trump described in the 2005 videotape continued to spark renewed controversy this week, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) told a reporter from the Weekly Standard that when it came to Trump’s allusions to forcibly kissing women and grabbing them by their genitals, ” I don’t characterize that as sexual assault.” After someone tweeted in response that Sessions’s comments were akin to when then-Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) torpedoed his 2012 Senate bid to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) by referring to “legitimate rape,” McCaskill said that was “not fair to Todd Akin.” Paul Kane in Washington, Philip Rucker in St. Louis, Sean Sullivan in Charlotte and John Wagner in Detroit contributed to this report.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old By upholding a key provision of the Affordable Care Act in King v. Burwell, a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court demonstrated that while the conservative revolution led by Justice Antonin Scalia may have had a strong impact on the court (and on the nation), it has not succeeded in winning over Justice Anthony Kennedy or Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Thus, while Scalia has won many battles, he has not won the war. And in Thursday’s King v Burwell decision he lost a major battle. Scalia has fought tirelessly both to limit the court’s focus in interpreting statutes (in other words, to look only at the letter of the law and not at the broader purpose of the legislation) and to limit the power of the national government. King v. Burwell seemed tailor-made to vindicate both goals. The basic question in the case was whether the phrase an “exchange established by the state” included health-care exchanges established by the federal government in states that refused to create their own. The plaintiffs argued that “established by the State” means that health insurance subsidies could not be offered in states that had chosen to use the federal health insurance market instead of their own. This is, indeed, a very strict interpretation. For Scalia, the answer was easy: “established by the state” could not possibly mean “established by the state or the federal government.” Had Scalia’s textualism prevailed, the decision would have gutted the ACA. Six million people in the 34 states where the federal government runs the insurance marketplace could have lost subsidies, and premiums could have skyrocketed. But that didn’t happen. Instead, Roberts wrote an otherwise unremarkable opinion that invoked traditional principles of statutory interpretation and examined the meaning of the phrase “established by the state” in context. The chief justice looked beyond the plain language of the clause at issue. He insisted that a court should interpret the language of the law in light of the overall legislative purpose. As the chief justice wrote: And a contrary interpretation would have defeated the central purpose of the statute. In this approach, the court acts as Congress’s partner, not its censor. In his dissent, Scalia was clearly furious that Roberts refused to endorse his revolutionary approach to statutory interpretation. From Scalia’s perspective, Roberts’ heresy was magnified by the fact that the chief justice cast the deciding vote to validate the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v Sebelius in 2012, in which the legality of the individual mandate was upheld. When Scalia gets mad, he does not hold back. He has often adopted fairly sharp language in his dissents, but even by that standard, his dissent in King v. Burwell is extraordinary in tone: “… normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of the present court: the Affordable Care Act must be saved.” His vituperation reaches a crescendo in the conclusion where he snipes, “We should start calling this law SCOTUScare.” One can debate the appropriate moniker for the ACA, and one can debate whether we should call this the Roberts Court or the Kennedy Court, but what is beyond debate is that this is not the Scalia Court.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old Several industries have become notorious for the millions they spend on influencing legislation and getting friendly candidates into office: Big Oil, Big Pharma and the gun lobby among them. But one has managed to quickly build influence with comparatively little scrutiny: Private prisons. The two largest for-profit prison companies in the United States – GEO and Corrections Corporation of America – and their associates have funneled more than $10 million to candidates since 1989 and have spent nearly $25 million on lobbying efforts. Meanwhile, these private companies have seen their revenue and market share soar. They now rake in a combined $3.3 billion in annual revenue and the private federal prison population more than doubled between 2000 and 2010, according to a report by the Justice Policy Institute. Private companies house nearly half of the nation’s immigrant detainees, compared to about 25 percent a decade ago, a Huffington Post report found. In total, there are now about 130 private prisons in the country with about 157,000 beds. Marco Rubio is one of the best examples of the private prison industry’s growing political influence, a connection that deserves far more attention now that he’s officially launched a presidential bid. The U.S. senator has a history of close ties to the nation’s second-largest for-profit prison company, GEO Group, stretching back to his days as speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. While Rubio was leading the House, GEO was awarded a state government contract for a $110 million prison soon after Rubio hired an economic consultant who had been a trustee for a GEO real estate trust. Over his career, Rubio has received nearly $40,000 in campaign donations from GEO, making him the Senate’s top career recipient of contributions from the company. (Rubio’s office did not respond to requests for comment.) The Justice Policy Institute identified the private-prison industry’s three-pronged approach to increase profits through political influence: lobbying, direct campaign contributions, and building relationships and networks. On its website, CCA states that the company doesn’t lobby on policies that affect “the basis for or duration of an individual’s incarceration or detention.” Still, several reports have documented instances when private-prison companies have indirectly supported policies that put more Americans and immigrants behind bars – such as California’s three-strikes rule and Arizona’s highly controversial anti-illegal immigration law – by donating to politicians who support them, attending meetings with officials who back them, and lobbying for funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Showing just how important these policies are to the private prison industry, both GEO Group and Corrections Corporation of America have warned shareholders that changes in these policies would hurt their bottom lines. In its 2014 annual report, CCA wrote: This outlook runs counter to what should be a rehabilitative mission of the nation’s criminal justice system. Instead, private prison contracts often require the government to keep the correctional facilities and immigration detention centers full, forcing communities to continuously funnel people into the prison system, even if actual crime rates are falling. Nearly two-thirds of private prison contracts mandate that state and local governments maintain a certain occupancy rate – usually 90 percent – or require taxpayers to pay for empty beds. In Arizona, three private prisons are operating with a 100 percent occupancy guarantee, according to Mother Jones. There’s even a lockup quota at the federal level: The Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention budget includes a mandate from Congress that at least 34,000 immigrants remain detained on a daily basis, a quota that has steadily grown each year, even as the undocumented immigrant population in the United States has leveled off. Private prisons have profited handsomely from that policy, owning nine of the 10 largest ICE detention centers, according to a report released this month by Grassroots Leadership. With the growing influence of the prison lobby, the nation is, in effect, commoditizing human bodies for an industry in militant pursuit of profit. For instance, privatization created the atmosphere that made the “Kids For Cash” scandal possible, in which two Pennsylvania judges received $2.6 million in kickbacks from for-profit juvenile detention centers for sending more kids to the facilities and with unusually long sentences. The influence of private prisons creates a system that trades money for human freedom, often at the expense of the nation’s most vulnerable populations: children, immigrants and the poor. The biggest beneficiaries of private prisons’ political donations have been Republican politicians in Florida, Tennessee, and border states with high populations of undocumented immigrants. The Republic Party of Florida PAC has received nearly $2.5 million from GEO and CCA since 1989. In 2010, GEO and its affiliates pumped $33,500 into political action committees benefiting Florida Republicans, including the Marco Rubio for U.S. Senate PAC. Since 2009, GEO Group’s co-founder and chief executive, George Zoley, has personally donated $6,480 to Rubio. A 2011 investigative report published by The Center for Media and Democracy detailed the connections between Rubio and GEO during his time in the Florida House. It notes that Rubio hired Donna Arduin, a former trustee for GEO’s Correctional Properties Trust, as an economic consultant. Arduin worked with Rubio’s then-budget chief, Ray Sansom, who pushed through a $110 million deal for a new GEO prison in the House Appropriations Bill. The report also detailed how legislation favorable to GEO Group has shadowed Arduin’s presence in government from California to Florida. In 2011, Florida Gov. Rick Scott – who also used Arduin as a budget adviser – pushed (unsuccessfully) to privatize 27 prisons south of Orlando. Upon winning the Senate seat, Rubio tapped former lobbyist Cesar Conda as his chief of staff in 2011. Conda had co-founded what is now GEO’s main lobbying firm, Navigators Global, and after joining Rubio, continued receiving payments of $150,000 from the firm as part of a stock buyout arrangement. In April 2014, Conda went on to lead Rubio’s Reclaim America PAC as a senior adviser, until recently rejoining Navigators. During Conda’s time with Rubio, GEO became a top-10 contributor to Reclaim America, giving $16,000 in 2014, according to OpenSecrets.org. Conda’s firm also banked $610,000 from the private prison company between 2011 and 2014 as its lobbying firm. According to a disclosure form obtained by The Nation, among the issues Navigators lobbied for on GEO’s behalf was immigration reform, an issue on which Rubio has remained dubious. In an e-mail responding to these issues, Conda said Navigators never lobbied for GEO’s prison business (he said the services were for GEO’s subsidiary, BI Incorporated, and the team working on it, which he wasn’t a part of, focused on homeland-security issues), and that he never met nor communicated with a Navigators lobbyist about GEO while working for Rubio, though he couldn’t speak for other members of senator’s staff. But Rubio shouldn’t get a pass just because there’s no clear quid pro quo. What our criminal justice system needs is reform, not incentive for expansion. In fact, opposition to criminal justice reform should render any candidate woefully inadequate to lead a nation suffering from a prison system that essentially perpetuates the oppression of its most vulnerable citizens. We can’t allow the proliferation of private prisons and their political influence to remain the most important issue that no one’s talking about.

        "articles": "Desktop notifications are on | Turn off Get breaking news alerts from The Washington Post Turn on desktop notifications? Local and state government agencies from Oregon to Connecticut say they are using a Russian brand of security software despite the federal government’s instructions to its own agencies not to buy the software over concerns about cyberespionage, records and interviews show. The federal agency in charge of purchasing, the General Services Administration, this month removed Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab from its list of approved vendors. In doing so, the agency’s statement suggested a vulnerability exists in Kaspersky that could give the Russian government backdoor access to the systems it protects, though it offered no explanation or evidence. Kaspersky has strongly denied coordinating with the Russian government and has offered to cooperate with federal investigators. The GSA’s move on July 11 has left state and local governments to speculate about the risks of sticking with the company or abandoning taxpayer-funded contracts, sometimes at great cost. The lack of information from the GSA underscores a disconnect between local officials and the federal government about cybersecurity. Interviews suggest that concerns in recent months from Congress and in the intelligence community about Kaspersky are not widely known among state and local officials, who are most likely to consider purchasing the Russian software. Those systems, while not necessarily protecting critical infrastructure, can be targeted by hackers because they provide access to troves of sensitive information. U.S. intelligence chiefs in May told a Senate panel that they wouldn’t use the company’s software during a broader hearing investigating Russia’s alleged meddling in the U.S. presidential election. It was not the first time Congress had heard that message: A former U.S. official told The Washington Post that congressional staff was advised by law enforcement in late 2015 to stop meeting with Kaspersky representatives over national security concerns. “People need to know that they can trust software updates,” said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a digital advocacy group. About the GSA’s decision, he said: “We need more public information.” In the weeks since Kaspersky’s delisting, The Post found that it continues to be used on government computers in jurisdictions ranging from Portland, Ore., to Fayetteville, Ga., where an official said they have a year-to-year contract. Kaspersky also has been purchased for use by the federal government in recent years, including the Bureau of Prisons and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Both agencies said last week that they needed additional time to determine whether the software is still in use. To identify the agencies, The Post reviewed state, local and federal government websites to obtain documents that listed Kaspersky or its programs, including city council agendas, annual agency reports and government procurement records. Officials interviewed in nine jurisdictions all said they had purchased or supported software made by Kaspersky within the past two years. Nearly all said they had no immediate plans to replace the software. “We use it, and I think it works well,” said John Morrisson, systems manager for the Connecticut Division of Public Defender Services. “I don't have any problems, and we don't have any viruses. And it's doing the job I require of it.” Morrisson said the concerns about Kaspersky are speculative, but he said he would consider jettisoning the Russian brand if specific vulnerabilities are identified. In the District, a spokesman for the city’s chief technology officer said that most city agencies use anti-virus software made by McAfee, a Kaspersky competitor. But District employees who connect to the network remotely are allowed for now to use home computers equipped with Kaspersky. In Picayune, Miss., Kaspersky is scheduled to be installed soon as the firewall on a new wireless system for all public schools. Network administrator Jason Wheat said he hadn’t seen the news about the GSA’s decision or received any warning from the state about not using Kaspersky. But he said he wasn’t worried about the software because employee Social Security numbers are stored on a separate server maintained by the state. In Oregon, Kaspersky is used with other anti-virus software by Portland city government to scan for malicious emails. Connecticut’s public defender said that as of early 2016 its office had hundreds of computers that ran Kaspersky. And San Marcos, Tex., last month approved a $92,744 contract for Kaspersky’s anti-virus protection; a spokeswoman said the city has held a contract with Kaspersky for many years and renewed the software in June before the delisting notice was issued by the U.S. government. In announcing its decision, the GSA said that its mission is to “ensure the integrity and security of U.S. government systems and networks” and that Kaspersky was delisted “after review and careful consideration.” The action removed the company from the list of products approved for purchase on federal systems and at discounted prices for state governments. The GSA included a reference to “System of Operational-Investigative Measures,” or SORM — a national Russian electronic eavesdropping network that the U.S. government publicly warned about in advance of Americans traveling to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. At the time, the State Department advised travelers to assume that cellphones could be turned into listening devices and laptops could be infiltrated if connected to Russian networks. The GSA statement this month said “applicability” of SORM to Kaspersky “supported GSA’s decision to exercise the cancellation clause.” A former senior U.S. law enforcement official, who works in cybersecurity and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he thinks that the reference to SORM indicates the “GSA is saying there is some kind of vulnerability that gives the [Russian] government access.” Representatives for the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security referred questions about Kaspersky to the GSA, which declined to comment beyond the original statement. Kaspersky officials declined interview requests, referring reporters to a statement denying wrongdoing that was issued after the GSA’s announcement. “Kaspersky Lab has no ties to any government, and the company has never helped, or will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company said. “Kaspersky Lab, a private company, seems to be caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight where each side is attempting to use the company as a pawn in their political game.” Kaspersky Lab was founded in 1997 by Eugene Kaspersky, a decade after he had graduated from a KGB-supported cryptography school and had worked in Russian military intelligence agencies. The company became an international success, sometimes promoting Kaspersky’s background in Russian intelligence. By 2010, it claimed to be the most widely used anti-virus software in Europe. In the United States, for example, Kaspersky was among the anti-virus software packaged with computers sold at Best Buy. Today, Kaspersky boasts 400 million users and 270,000 corporate clients worldwide. Kaspersky has tried to advance the company into potentially lucrative government markets. The company created a subsidiary, Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, or KGSS, and began hosting an annual cybersecurity summit in Washington. In 2015, the keynote address at the annual conference was delivered by Michael Flynn, then the recently departed head of the Defense Intelligence Agency who would go on to briefly become President Trump’s national security adviser. Flynn was paid more than $11,000 for the appearance, which he initially failed to disclose this year when he joined the White House. The company never became a major player in U.S. government markets. Popular American firms, often with executives who had their own ties to U.S. intelligence agencies, routinely beat out Kaspersky for the largest federal contracts and defense work. Three current and former defense contractors told The Post that they knew of no specific warnings circulated about Kaspersky in recent years, but it has become an unwritten rule at the Pentagon not to include Kaspersky as a potential vendor on new projects. Another former U.S. official said some congressional staffers were warned by federal law enforcement officials as early as November 2015 not to meet with employees from Kaspersky over concerns of electronic surveillance. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Skepticism of Kaspersky became public in May when a panel of U.S. intelligence community leaders testified before Congress that they wouldn’t use the firm’s software on their own computers. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) noted the widespread use of the software and asked, “Would any of you be comfortable with the Kaspersky Lab software on your computers?” “A resounding no from me,” said Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats. CIA Director Mike Pompeo, acting FBI director Andrew McCabe and National Security Agency Director Adm. Michael S. Rogers also said they would not use Kaspersky. The government’s unease about Kaspersky follows the conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian President Vladimir Putin last year ordered a campaign of cyberattacks to undermine the election. The Justice Department has named a special counsel to investigate possible coordination between Trump’s associates and Russian officials during the campaign. James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said “it's difficult, if not impossible” for a company like Kaspersky to be headquartered in Moscow “if you don't cooperate with the government and the intelligence services.” Kaspersky has worked to protect its image since the GSA decision. It said this month that it would be willing to turn over its software source code to federal investigators. The Senate Armed Services Committee this month unanimously adopted an amendment by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) that would force the government to strip Kaspersky from any government systems connected to defense networks. In a statement, Shaheen said the Trump administration and Congress should go further and require all government systems to drop Kaspersky. “The ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are very alarming,” Shaheen said. Correction: Due to an error by a transcription service, a quote in a previous version of this article was incorrectly attributed to acting FBI director Andrew McCabe. The quote, “A resounding no from me,” was made by Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats.",

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old What's the big deal about getting an ID? You need one, after all, to participate in society in all kinds of other ways — to drive, to get married, to buy beer. Surely the requirement to show an ID on Election Day can't be that burdensome. This is a common defense of Voter ID laws like the kind now on the books in Texas, ostensibly meant to curb voter fraud. But it glosses over the reality of life for some voters, who may struggle to get around because of disabilities, who may lack the seemingly small sums necessary to pay for documentation, who may not have the flexible scheduling to visit a government office twice, or three times, or more. Small obstacles like these are magnified in the frantic days leading up to the election — and add to this the confusion that ensues when people who have voted for years are suddenly told at their familiar polling places they don't have what they need this time. In the end, you get scenarios like this one, described by the Brennan Center forJustice at NYU in a roundup of actual complications arising right now in Texas during early voting: What's most alarming about stories like this is that poll workers, confronted with such a situation, seemed unfamiliar enough with the new law themselves to explain to McGriff his options. Through the prodding of McMinn, he was eventually given an absentee ballot application and was able to vote by mail. Another woman, who had trouble obtaining an ID because of disabilities, was never told that she qualified for an exemption from the law. This man was never told how to obtain an Election Identification Certificate, or the alternative available to people without a qualifying ID: One more: These stories come from both the Brennan Center's own investigation on the ground in Texas and through advocacy organizations working with voters there. Such testimonials don't tell us much about the scale of voters blocked from voting by ID laws. But they offer a window into why the requirement to obtain an ID can be more problematic than it sounds.

        "articles": "In the United States in the year 2021, you, as an American citizen, do not necessarily have the right to vote. You do not necessarily have the right to teach or to learn about matters of race, gender or anything else state lawmakers consider “divisive concepts.” But you do have one absolute, sacrosanct, inviolate, God-given, self-evident and inalienable right: the right to refuse a coronavirus vaccine — and to infect as many people as you can. With the blessing of the Roberts court, legislatures in Republican-run states are rushing to impose new voting restrictions, particularly on non-White voters. A tally by the Brennan Center finds that, as of June 21, 17 states had enacted 28 new laws restricting the ability to vote since the start of this year. At the same time, 10 states have enacted, and 26 states are weighing, restrictions on classroom discussions of racism and sexism, according to an Education Week count. Ostensibly, these restrictions combat critical race theory, an academic notion turned into a boogeyman by Republican politicians and sympathetic groups. But while curtailing freedoms for some, red states are simultaneously extending civil rights to a previously unprotected class: the anti-vaxxers. A count by the Husch Blackwell law firm lists at least 17 Republican-run states that have enacted laws or orders protecting the rights of those who refuse coronavirus vaccines, with more such laws in process. If there is a philosophy behind this selective approach, it’s this: Rights for me but not for thee. The red states are protecting the liberties of their political supporters — and taking liberties with everybody else’s. Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic “These are Republicans who believe in the right to infect as a fundamental right,” Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat, observed of the “very selective” approach to liberty in the red states. I spoke to him outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning before he escorted three dozen Democratic Texas legislators to a news conference to decry the egregious attempt by Gov. Greg Abbott and the GOP-controlled legislature to suppress the votes of Black and Latino Texans. More than 50 Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum as they tried to ram through a law that would abolish the drive-up voting and 24-hour voting used heavily by minority voters in 2020. “We are always going to push back against these sort of bigoted, racist, Jim Crow 2.0-style voting laws,” Rep. Marc Veasey, a Texas Democrat who is Black, said at the news conference with the legislators. Texas Republicans have been at the forefront of the nationwide effort to bestow freedoms on political allies while curtailing them for others. In addition to its voter suppression effort, Texas also enacted a law prescribing in detail how teachers can discuss race. Slavery and racism may not be portrayed as “anything other than deviations from, betrayals of, or failures to live up to, the authentic founding principles of the United States, which include liberty and equality.” No credit may be given for internships “involving social or public policy advocacy.” Contrast these highly detailed restrictions with the sweeping freedoms granted to vaccine refusers. Abbott issued an order suspending part of the Texas health code so that “no governmental entity can compel any individual to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.” And a law enacted last month decrees that “a business in this state may not require a customer to provide any documentation certifying the customer’s COVID-19 vaccination” to receive services. The pattern holds throughout red America. Republican-run states are racing to restrict voting by mail and in-person voting hours and locations, and to implement voter purges and voter ID requirements that disproportionately disenfranchise non-White voters, all to combat the (largely imaginary) problem of voter fraud. Georgia banned giving food or water to voters waiting in long lines — lines caused by reduced polling access in Black precincts. The new education edicts, likewise, propose a modern equivalent of book banning to mitigate the (fabricated) threat of critical race theory. Montana has declared that students may not be “forced to ‘reflect,’ ‘deconstruct,’ or ‘confront’ their racial identities.” Ohio is one of several states considering laws directing that “no school district shall teach, instruct, or train any divisive concepts.” Arizona will fine school districts if teachers don’t obey. But the right to catch and spread covid-19 shall not be infringed. As Axios’s Caitlin Owens wrote on Monday, Republican state legislators would “give unvaccinated people the same protections as those surrounding race, gender and religion.” In Montana, for example, a law requires that restaurants and other public accommodations must admit the unvaccinated. One law professor called the Montana law a “civil rights statute” akin to banning discrimination against the Irish. Nonsense. Civil rights, as we knew them, prohibited discrimination “on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.” Now, Republicans are trashing those rights in favor of a new protected class — on the basis of political views.

Yet Smith’s new role in 2013 as the House’s science boss seemed less influential, leading a committee viewed as a backwater and first stop for freshman lawmakers. But he quickly remade the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology into a bulldog as ferocious as any in a Congress riven by partisanship. As the Obama administration escalated its fight against climate change with new environmental regulations, the lawyer from San Antonio, Tex. became a key player among the holdouts. As lawyers and lobbyists were devising legal strategies to try to dismantle the president’s climate-change agenda, Smith became the lawmaker bent on debunking the science behind it. [Standoff over government climate study provokes a national furor from scientists] Now finishing his third year as chairman, the Yale-educated lawmaker who has represented Texas Hill Country and parts of Austin and San Antonio since 1987 has used new subpoena powers to an unprecedented degree. He’s called on the administration to account for air-pollution regulations he says are not backed up by science. He’s tried to slash NASA’s budget for earth sciences. He’s subjected grant reviews at the National Science Foundation to extra scrutiny. One of Congress’s most prominent global warming skeptics, Smith, 68, has railed against environmentalists and the media for buying into the “climate-change religion.” In the fall he took on his biggest target yet, accusing federal scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of colluding to doctor data in a pivotal global warming study that refuted the long-held notion that the planet’s warming had “paused.” [NOAA chief tells lawmaker: No one will ‘coerce the scientists who work for me] “He’s taken the science committee to a new level,” said Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), a freshman who leads the committee’s oversight panel. “We’re challenging the status quo… You’re talking about very significant regulations imposed by this administration. We’re asking, ‘Is the science behind them valid?'” His detractors accuse Smith of taking oversight to a new level of bullying by questioning the motives of federal scientists and threatening their freedom. Critics say he’s out of step with mainstream scientific thinking on climate change, which concludes that man-made pollution is behind the planet’s warming. His confrontation with NOAA Administrator Kathryn Sullivan started over the summer, soon after a team of scientists on her staff published their findings on the global warming pause in the peer-reviewed journal Science. [Congressman now threatens to subpoena Commerce secretary over global warming report] Smith accused the scientists of altering historical global temperature data and rushing to publish their research to advance Obama’s “extreme climate agenda.” The chairman subpoenaed the scientists and other NOAA staff and demanded that they turn over internal emails related to their research. Sullivan balked for weeks, finally releasing about 100 emails from non-scientists last week that NOAA officials say contain none of the evidence Smith is seeking. Meanwhile, prominent societies representing thousands of scientists have rallied around her, warning the congressman in a letter in November that his efforts are “establishing a practice of inquests.” “He is bringing more prominence to the committee by challenging the integrity of scientists,” said Rush Holt, a physicist and New Jersey Democrat who served with Smith in the House from 1999 until this year. “It’s an interesting way to raise the profile of a science committee,” said Holt, now chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “In fact it seems to be Smith who is substituting politics for evidence and not the scientists.” [Top lawmaker rebuked on climate study accusation] Smith, through his staff, declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this article or to answer questions by email. He and his allies reject criticism that he is politicizing science as head of a committee that oversees space exploration, research and development and has jurisdiction over agencies from NOAA to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. They say it’s the government that’s doing just that in the service of excessive federal regulation of the environment, with mandates that threaten the economy and crucial industries like gas, oil and coal. “His constituents see a man that’s fighting for the energy community here in Texas, which is a large part of the employment base,” said Charles McConnell, who served two years in the Obama administration as assistant secretary for the Energy Department, responsible for fossil fuels. Now at Rice University, McConnell has criticized new Environmental Protection Agency air quality regulations as “rampant environmentalism.” “I don’t believe Smith is against regulation,” said McConnell, who has testified before the committee. “He’s interested in scientifically based regulation.” A lawyer by training, Smith is a fifth-generation Texan who got his law degree from Southern Methodist University. He told The Hill in 2012 that he has long had a soft spot for science, winning the Bausch & Lomb Science Award in high school and studying astronomy and physics in college. He also has a pilot’s license. Even as his district has gotten more liberal in recent years as it took in more of Austin, home to the University of Texas, Smith has always been reelected with at least 60 percent of the vote. He landed as chairman of the science panel after two years heading the Judiciary Committee, where Republican rules limited his term because he had served a total of six years as the panel’s top GOP lawmaker. By late 2013, his seniority on the science panel put him in line for the consolation prize of committee chairman. Colleagues describe Smith as genial, courtly and well prepared at committee hearings. But his Democratic colleagues say he has sidelined them and their staffs, especially when he has used the GOP’s new, unilateral power in this Congress to depose and subpoena federal officials without a vote. His push for a more aggressive oversight role for the committee has been polarizing. Early on, for example, his staff spent long hours at the offices of the grant making National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va.., scrutinizing projects and criticizing many they believe did not merit federal funding. As the climate change summit got underway in Paris in November, the science committee held a hearing whose title revealed precisely where Smith stands: “Pitfalls of Unilateral Negotiations at the Paris Climate Change Conference.” Two of the three witnesses the Republicans called to testify were not scientists, but policy experts representing conservative think tanks, a common practice at hearings. Other witnesses have affiliations with the energy industry, Democrats complain. Earlier this year, Smith issued a subpoena to compel the Environmental Protection Agency to produce text messages and phone records for Administrator Gina McCarthy as it investigated proposed limits on ozone it said would amount to the most costly federal regulation in history. He has also demanded EPA cor­res­pond­ence with out­side groups on a range of en­vir­on­ment­al rules and reg­u­lat­ions, to show that they collaborated with the administration, for example in curtailing power-plant emissions. Supporters say the chairman’s roots in Texas —a state that has objected strenuously to EPA rules slashing ozone levels and pollution from coal-fired power plants —form the core of his skepticism. “Scrutiny of global warming started here,” said Michael Nasi, an Austin air-quality lawyer who represents many of the state’s electric power producers. “It’s incumbent on any federal lawmaker to be asking, are we looking at controls that will really have legitimate health benefits?” Texas regulators, for example, have questioned whether EPA’s emissions crackdown would really improve public health. Smith has received more than $600,000 from the fossil fuel industry during his career in Congress, campaign finance data show. On the foundational question of whether human behavior is behind the earth’s rising temperatures, Smith has been called a truth seeker, a climate skeptic and a climate denier. He is fond of saying that “good science” should rule the day, while his detractors say it’s Smith who has lost sight of good science. Just before he was installed as committee chairman, Smith said in a statement in response to questions from reporters that he believes climate change “is due to a combination of factors, including natural cycles, sun spots, and human activity.” “But scientists still don’t know for certain how much each of these factors contributes to the overall climate change that the Earth is experiencing.” Read more: She’s braved rough seas and spacewalks.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old A remastered version of Ken Burns’s masterful documentary, “The Civil War,” began airing on PBS yesterday to mark the 25th anniversary of the film and the 150th anniversary of the end of the conflict. I wrote about the process of remastering the film, and Burns’s opportunity to make the movie he always dreamed of, on Friday. All week, I’ll be running excerpts of a long conversation we had about “The Civil War,” race, violence, photography and historical scholarship. This is the first installment. “The Civil War,” which is airing on PBS this week in a handsomely remastered state, is Ken Burns’s most famous film. But while the documentarian’s subjects have ranged widely across the American landscape and American history, covering everything from the Shaker movement to the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright and the trauma of the Dust Bowl, Burns has returned to race again and again. Whether he’s examining black art in “Jazz,” the integration of the national sport in “Baseball,” profiling American Indian leaders in “The West,” chronicling the rise and struggles of boxer Jack Johnson in “Unforgivable Blackness” or advocating for the men wrongfully convicted of rape in “The Central Park Five,” race defines Ken Burns’s America. And although “The Civil War” may have ended with a surrender, the issues over which the war was fought are far from settled. “I think in some ways, the subsequent films have convinced me only more certainly of our thing about the war, that it was the central event. Race is one of the things of American culture. I’ve taken a lot of criticism for saying that,” Burns told me when we met in a New York editing studio in May. “So, doing ‘Jackie Robinson,’ has echoes with Ferguson. Doing ‘Central Park Five’ has echoes back to Emmett Till and some of the realities of slavery. All of the way the Ferguson municipality behaved to its own citizens, its majority citizens, is not dissimilar to the way Jim Crow sharecroppers experienced the pernicious substitute for slavery: ‘Well, if we can’t own you, we have to pay you something, it won’t be very much, but we’re going to own every other aspect of you. And by the way now, since you’re no longer my property, I can kill you with impunity, because you’re not valuable to me.’ … And while there was no law that protected African Americans in slavery, and there were supposedly laws that protected them afterwards, they weren’t applied, and in many cases as we learn with chilling regularity, still aren’t applied.” For Burns, those insights took time to develop. As a child — he was 8 when America marked the Civil War centennial — he and his brother played with a toy soldier set, and Burns, “as the older brother, always insisted on being blue. He had to be the gray. Which ultimately meant that I would win without ever considering what the underlying historical realities were.” But “by the time I did ‘The Civil War,’ ” Burns explained, “it was really clear that that dynamic was old, it was shoddy, and it was most of all untrue, that African Americans, as every narrative heretofore, every popular narrative had suggested were passive bystanders, were in fact active, dedicated, self-sacrificing soldiers in an intensely personal drama of self-liberation. That it was at the heart of it.” Burns doesn’t have much patience for narratives about the Civil War that suggest that its causes were anything other than race, pointing squarely at the South Carolina articles of secession: “Is there the words ‘states’ rights’ in their articles of secession? No. Is the word ‘slavery’ there? Yes. Many times.” “People say, ‘Oh, it’s about states’ rights.’ ‘It’s about agricultural economics.’ ‘It’s about political differences.’ ‘It’s about social differences,'” he said, running through the list of justifications. “Yeah, the social differences based on a society that keeps people free or doesn’t pay their laborers. That pays for work or doesn’t pay for work. Right? That creates huge, different societal differences. And certainly it’s political, because as the equilibrium of power that the South had dominated in the presidency and in Congress is being challenged by new states that are increasingly less interested in slavery, they’re interested in taking their ball and going home. That’s the political reality. And the economic stuff? Yeah, they’re afraid that someone’s going to pass a law that’s going to deny them their single greatest wealth, which is the ownership of 4 million other human beings, in 1861 … Slavery is why the Civil War happened. And slavery is still this original sin that Americans have to figure out, somehow, how to transcend and overcome.” And he’s sharply aware of the way these kinds of obfuscations persist in contemporary political discourse. “So if the president wasn’t born in the United States, that’s another way of saying the n-word. If he’s Muslim, that’s another way of saying the n-word. All of these things are code, new racial code, for words that now have, at least in public, lost their respectability,” Burns continued, marveling at the way the end of the Civil War only forced white supremacist language and practices to mutate to fit their new circumstances. “You would rather be able to look at a black person and tell them what to do, and most often today, that means ‘Please stay out of sight. If that means we have to warehouse you in prison, if that means we have to treat your suburb that’s now growing increasingly dark, then we’ll tax you and fine you and keep you in jail to keep our coffers full, and coincidentally, you out of the way.’ All of those things are taking place today, today in the United States.” Given the role of race in Burns’s films and thinking, I asked whether he ever considered making a film about Reconstruction, the period after the Civil War when the states that seceded were reintegrated back into the United States — and when the promises made to freed slaves immediately began to falter. As it turns out, Burns had actually contemplated making a Reconstruction movie before “The Civil War,” and it’s only now that the film has achieved what Burns refers to as “inner emotional traction.” “I’ve said yes, fully, to it,” he told me. “We’ve got a skein of films under production that go to 2020, so I imagine even before that, we’ll begin work on it.” The series doesn’t have an official title yet, but right now, Burns is referring to it as “From Emancipation to Exodus” and planning for it to run three episodes. “It’s that period from Jan. 1, 1863, when African Americans get their freedom, but they get nothing but their freedom, through the end of the Civil War, the promise of Reconstruction, the collapse of Reconstruction, the rise of Jim Crow, the Ku Klux Klan and lynching, through black leaders who are trying to adjust to this new dynamic — Booker T. Washington, urging accommodation, W.E.B. Dubois urging the strengthening of institutions, Marcus Garvey even suggesting that blacks go back to Africa, finally culminating with the post-World War I [sentiment]: ‘You know what, eight out of ten of us still live in the South, let’s get the hell out of here,’ initiating the Great Migration that would take place over the next several decades.” He even knows what the last words of the documentary will be. “They would head, as the poet Langston Hughes wrote, ‘towards the warmth of other suns.’ ” In all the time Burns has been chronicling American history, that dream hasn’t been accomplished.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old A new poll commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters and AFSCME finds that Dem Gary Peters is leading GOPer Terri Lynn Land in Michigan by seven points, 43-37. The average of polls shows Peters leading by over six points. Is it possible that in this particular race, climate change and the Koch brothers — whose group, Americans for Prosperity, has spent millions bludgeoning Peters over Obamacare — are hurting the Republican candidate? The internals of the poll — which was done by respected Dem pollster Joel Benenson and hasn’t been released — show that Michigan voters view the Koch brothers unfavorably by more than two to one: 32-15. While it’s true that 33 percent have not heard of them, a total of 56 percent have heard of them, which is pretty high. A large majority finds the anti-Koch message — that Land is beholden to big oil billionaires bankrolling her campaign — convincing. The poll also finds that 45 percent see climate change as an urgent problem, and another 13 percent see it as a problem to address in the years ahead — a total of 57 percent. And it finds 39 percent would probably or definitely not vote for someone who doesn’t believe human activity is causing climate change. Land’s position is that climate change exists, but she hasn’t, to my knowledge, clarified whether she believes humans cause it. You should treat such internal polling with skepticism, and it’s hard to know how much this stuff matters, if at all. But here is a race where Dems are campaigning as if they genuinely do think they can make climate skepticism a liability. And when it comes to the long, painful quest of environmentalists to prove that they can turn climate change into an issue that matters in elections, the Michigan contest remains an experiment to watch. Gary Peters is one of the few Democratic candidates this cycle who has been talking about climate change, in part because the issue matters in Michigan, due to the Great Lakes’ importance to the state economy. The Koch brothers have also taken on unique environmentally-related importance here, because of the role of a Koch Industries affiliate in a major local story involving piles of petroleum coke along the Detroit River. Peters has called on Land to clarify whether she believes in climate science, while tying her to the Koch brothers — as a beneficiary of all that Koch cash — and localizing the Koch/environmental nexus by hammering her over the pet-coke (call it Pet-Koch?) story. To get a sense of what that looks like, check out this ad a coalition of environmental groups has run against Land in Michigan — backed, according to the Michigan Democratic Party, by a $700,000 buy: To be sure, climate issues may not matter much to the outcome either way. If Peters wins, it could be because this is a blue-leaning state or because Land is generally a terrible candidate. But the fact remains that Peters has probably been talking about climate and local environmental issues — and linking the Koch brothers to them in particular — more than any other Dem Senate candidate. He was doing this back in February, when he was down in the polls. And I’m told he’ll keep doing it, now that he’s up in the polls. And if he does win, environmentalists will argue that climate change — and tying the issue to the Koch brothers — made a difference. “The more people hear about the Koch brothers, the more concerns they have,” says Jeff Gohringer, spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters. “They could become a real liability for Terri Lynn Land.” The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

        "articles": "This article is more than 1 year old President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s fireside chats reassured and inspired the nation through Depression and war. During impeachment last fall, President Trump fancied himself likewise addressing Americans “perhaps as a fireside chat on live television.” There’s no better time than the present! In these dark times, Americans crave the comfort of competent leadership. I have therefore taken the liberty of drafting for Trump a fireside chat for our times — using entirely his own words. Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We have it totally under control. I’m not concerned at all. It’s one person coming in from China. We pretty much shut it down. It will all work out well. We’re in great shape. Doesn’t spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took. There’s a chance it won’t spread. It’s something that we have tremendous control over. Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear. Just stay calm. It will go away. The Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. This is their new hoax. Whatever happens, we’re totally prepared. Totally ready. We’re rated number one for being prepared. We are so prepared like we never have been prepared. Taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States. We’re very much ahead of everything. This is a flu. I didn’t know people died from the flu. Here, we’re talking about a much smaller range. It is very mild. Some people will have this at a very light level. Some of them go to work. The mortality rate is much, much better. In my opinion it’s way, way down. I think it’s substantially below 1 percent. A fraction of 1 percent. I think the numbers are going to get progressively better as we go along. This is just my hunch. We have very little problem in this country. We only have five people. We only have 11 cases. Out of billions of people, 15 people. They’re getting better, and soon they’re all going to be better, hopefully. We’re going very substantially down, not up. The United States, because of what I did and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point. To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths. As of this moment, we have 50 deaths. I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be. Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth. The tests are all perfect. Anybody that wants a test can get a test. The tests are beautiful. We have a tremendous testing setup. I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. We are very close to a vaccine. A matter of months. You take a solid flu vaccine, you don’t think that could have an impact? Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. Based on very strong evidence. I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter. No way I’m going to cancel the convention. Stock Market starting to look very good to me! We’re the ones that gave the great response. I’d rate it a 10. We’ve done a fantastic job. I think they should be appreciative. Gallup just gave us the highest rating. The highest on record. I like this stuff. I really get it. Maybe I have a natural ability. We think it’s going to have a very good ending. We’re going to win faster than people think. I hope. This blindsided the world! Who could have ever predicted a thing like this? This was something that nobody has ever thought could happen to this country. I’ve always known this is a real, this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously. If you’re talking about the virus, no, that’s not under control for anyplace in the world. I was talking about what we’re doing is under control, but I’m not talking about the virus. I didn’t say Easter. It was just an aspiration. I am giving consideration to a QUARANTINE. The Opinions section is looking for stories of how the coronavirus has affected people of all walks of life. Write to us. So you’re talking about 2.2 million deaths. If we could hold that down…between 100,000 and 200,000, and we all together have done a very good job. START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!! Invoke “P”. I want our life back again. It was nobody’s fault. No, just things that happened. I don’t take responsibility at all.

        "articles": "Stuart Stevens was the chief strategist for the Romney presidential campaign. Over the years, one of the more troubling characteristics of the Democratic Party and the left in general has been a shortage of loyalty and an abundance of self-loathing. It would be a shame if we Republicans took a narrow presidential loss as a signal that those are traits we should emulate. I appreciate that Mitt Romney was never a favorite of D.C.’s green-room crowd or, frankly, of many politicians. That’s why, a year ago, so few of those people thought that he would win the Republican nomination. But that was indicative not of any failing of Romney’s but of how out of touch so many were in Washington and in the professional political class. Nobody liked Romney except voters. What began in a small field in New Hampshire grew into a national movement. It wasn’t our campaign, it was Romney. He bested the competition in debates, and though he was behind almost every candidate in the GOP primary at one time or the other, he won the nomination and came very close to winning the presidency. In doing so, he raised more money for the Republican Party than the party did. He trounced Barack Obama in debate. He defended the free-enterprise system and, more than any figure in recent history, drew attention to the moral case for free enterprise and conservative economics. When much of what passes for a political intelligentsia these days predicted that the selection of Rep. Paul Ryan meant certain death on the third rail of Medicare and Social Security, Romney brought the fight to the Democrats and made the rational, persuasive case for entitlement reform that conservatives have so desperately needed. The nation listened, thought about it — and on Election Day, Romney carried seniors by a wide margin. It’s safe to say that the entitlement discussion will never be the same. On Nov. 6, Romney carried the majority of every economic group except those with less than $50,000 a year in household income. That means he carried the majority of middle-class voters. While John McCain lost white voters younger than 30 by 10 points, Romney won those voters by seven points, a 17-point shift. Obama received 4½million fewer voters in 2012 than 2008, and Romney got more votes than McCain. The Obama organization ran a great campaign. In my world, the definition of the better campaign is the one that wins. But having been involved in three presidential races, two of which we won closely and one that we lost fairly closely, I know enough to know that we weren’t brilliant because Florida went our way in 2000 or enough Ohioans stuck with us in 2004. Nor are we idiots because we came a little more than 320,000 votes short of winning the electoral college in 2012. Losing is just losing. It’s not a mandate to throw out every idea that the candidate championed, and I would hope it’s not seen as an excuse to show disrespect for a good man who fought hard for values we admire. In the debates and in sweeping rallies across the country, Romney captured the imagination of millions of Americans. He spoke for those who felt disconnected from the Obama vision of America. He handled the unequaled pressures of a campaign with a natural grace and good humor that contrasted sharply with the angry bitterness of his critics. There was a time not so long ago when the problems of the Democratic Party revolved around being too liberal and too dependent on minorities. Obama turned those problems into advantages and rode that strategy to victory. But he was a charismatic African American president with a billion dollars, no primary and media that often felt morally conflicted about being critical. How easy is that to replicate? Yes, the Republican Party has problems, but as we go forward, let’s remember that any party that captures the majority of the middle class must be doing something right. When Mitt Romney stood on stage with President Obama, it wasn’t about television ads or whiz-bang turnout technologies, it was about fundamental Republican ideas vs. fundamental Democratic ideas. It was about lower taxes or higher taxes, less government or more government, more freedom or less freedom. And Republican ideals — Mitt Romney — carried the day. On Nov. 6, that wasn’t enough to win. But it was enough to make us proud and to build on for the future.
