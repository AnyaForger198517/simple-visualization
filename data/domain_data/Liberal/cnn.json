        "articles": "Trump has broken from Republican orthodoxy and embraced a protectionist trade stance Obama defends trade policies during meetings in Canada President Barack Obama laid into Donald Trump’s protectionist trade stance Wednesday, blasting the presumptive Republican nominee’s call for a withdrawal from trade deals as the “wrong medicine.” Obama’s comments, which came during a trip to Canada to meet with his fellow North American heads of state, came as Trump fights a public war with the business lobby over the issue. “Ordinary people who have concerns about trade have a legitimate gripe about globalization,” Obama continued, pointing to “growing inequality and stagnant wages.” “The question is, what do you do about it. And the prescription of withdrawing from trade deals and focusing solely on your local market – that’s the wrong medicine,” he said. Road to 270: The 2016 Electoral Map Obama called the idea “not feasible” because local businesses would suffer and lose jobs if they didn’t have access to international markets and because the costs of local goods would rise. Trump, speaking at a rally in Bangor, Maine, focused his fire on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, saying they are “totally controlled by the special interest groups … they want to have the deals they want to have.” Trump also took on the Chamber earlier in the day, tweeting, “The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts.” Trump plans to press ahead with his anti-free trade message in a speech in New Hampshire set for Thursday afternoon. Powerful business lobbies – both traditionally supportive of Republican candidates – took the highly unusual step of lashing out at Trump during a speech he gave Tuesday that hammered U.S. free-trade deals. “Under Trump’s trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy,” the Chamber tweeted during Tuesday’s speech in Monessen, Pennsylvania, linking to an analysis that argues Trump’s trade positions would throw the United States into an economic recession. Under Trump's trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy  pic.twitter.com/9jPtGXAOlQ And the Chamber kept up its attacks on Trump Wednesday. “The U.S. Chamber represents American businesses of all sizes from across the country, who recognize that free trade agreements, like the (Trans-Pacific Partnership), are an important way to accelerate economic growth and spur job creation in the U.S.,” Blair Latoff Holmes, a spokesman for the Chamber, said in a statement. “This is not personal. It’s not election politics. It’s smart policy.” The onslaught reflected a major break between right-leaning business interests and the party’s 2016 presidential nominee and demonstrate the possible downside to Trump of running as a protectionist Republican. It also comes as Trump attempts to ramp up fundraising – a challenge that could prove more difficult if the party’s business backers decide to back Hillary Clinton or focus their money on assisting down-ballot Republicans. The truth about trade, American jobs and Donald Trump Clinton’s campaign released a statement as well, saying Trump’s speech rejected “the idea that Americans can compete and win in the global economy,” and went point-by-point disputing Trump’s arguments or made the case with past Clinton statements that she had better ideas. “Throughout this campaign, Trump’s statements on trade, like everything else he says, have been erratic and irresponsible, full of bluster and the promise of a reckless trade strategy that would put American jobs at risk,” Clinton’s statement said. Trump has broken from Republican orthodoxy and embraced a protectionist trade stance that more closely mirrors liberals such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The real estate mogul has opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and on Tuesday said he’d seek to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement – a move that would result in the upheaval of economies across the continent. Trump argued that by doing so, he’d create more manufacturing jobs in the United States – a key element of his appeal to white, working-class communities in swing states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan. “Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?” Trump also tweeted Wednesday. The Chamber rebutted Trump point-by-point, arguing that NAFTA has created 5 million jobs, that the United States is selling more to South Korea since signing a trade deal and that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would add $77 billion to the U.S. economy by 2025. “Even under best case scenario, Trump’s tariffs would strip us of at least 3.5 million jobs,” the Chamber tweeted. Even under best case scenario, Trump's tariffs would strip us of at least 3.5 million jobs  pic.twitter.com/3SSHHqotNv Jay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, also took aim at Trump in a series of critical tweets. Directing his comments at Trump, he said that “you have it backward” and that “to win, WE need to write rules on trade – not China.” He also tweeted: “.@realDonaldTrump should understand 40% of manufacturing jobs are related to exports. We need more exports– not less.” .@realDonaldTrump you have it backward. Trade is GOOD for #mfg workers & #jobs. Let’s #MakeAmericaTradeAgain.  .@realDonaldTrump should understand 40% of manufacturing jobs are related to exports. We need more exports– not less pic.twitter.com/Hp60LeXGMo The Business Roundtable, another leading U.S. business organization representing the CEOs of major companies, also weighed in with a Medium post on what candidates are getting wrong on trade – though it’s much less direct than the Chamber and National Association of Manufacturers attacks. Asked if the criticism of Trump is an unprecedented step into a presidential race by the traditionally Republican-leaning Chamber, Holmes said in an email Tuesday that “this is about policy, not politics.” “The Chamber has long supported advancing and expanding trade, including TPP,” she wrote. “Despite much of the rhetoric we have heard out on the campaign trail, the next president should understand that selling more American-made goods and services around the world is one of the best ways to spur economic growth, support small businesses, create good-paying American jobs, and keep the United States one step ahead of its international competitors. “After all, 95% of the world’s consumers now live outside America’s borders, representing nearly limitless expansion opportunities for U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs.” Holmes did pour cold water on the possibility that the Chamber could endorse Clinton in the presidential race despite its opposition to Trump’s trade positions. The Chamber has in the past hit Clinton and Sanders for failing to offer broad enough support for free trade. Clinton has said she, too, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership – a deal negotiated under President Barack Obama, and which Clinton had once called the “gold standard” of trade pacts during her tenure as secretary of state. But free trade critics point out her husband, Bill Clinton, was responsible for implementing NAFTA – the first mega-regional trade deal. “For 104 years, the US Chamber has never gotten involved in a presidential race, and we do not plan to,” Holmes said. Holmes quickly followed up to signal that the Chamber’s criticism of Trump’s trade positions won’t soon be ending. “I want to add that while we don’t engage in presidential politics, we’ve also never hesitated to engage in a policy discussion,” she said. ’s Jim Acosta and Chris Frates contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Everything you need to know about bitcoin, blockchain, NFTs and more People linked to the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-backed troll group indicted by the United States for its alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election, are laying the groundwork to do the same in 2020, new information released by Facebook on Monday suggests. Profiles originating in Russia had since the beginning of this year been building a network of accounts on Instagram designed to look like groups in swing states, the company said. Instagram is owned by Facebook (FB). Although the accounts posed as Americans from all sides of the political spectrum, many were united in their opposition to the candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden, according to Graphika, a social media investigations company that Facebook asked to analyze the accounts. The Russian trolls who used social media to interfere in the 2016 election employed a similar tactic, going after Hillary Clinton from the right and also trying to spread a perception on the left that Clinton was not liberal enough and that liberals and African Americans especially shouldn’t bother voting for her. The accounts Facebook revealed Monday, 50 of which were on Instagram and one of which was on Facebook, were designed to look like they were advocating on a broad range of issues across American life. Accounts with usernames like @black.queen.chloe and @michigan_black_community_ looked like they were run by black activists. There were also pro and anti-Trump accounts, and accounts posing as feminists, LGBTQ rights advocates, and environmentalists. Other account names included @stop.trump2020, @bernie.2020__, @iowa.patriot, and @feminist_agenda_, according to Graphika. Facebook said the accounts combined had more than 250,000 followers, more than half of which were based in the U.S. Facebook did not disclose how many of those followers were real and how many might have been fake or bot accounts designed to make the main accounts look more legitimate. Facebook says it has removed the accounts. “It looked like there was a systematic focus on attacking Biden from both sides,” Graphika director of investigations Ben Nimmo, who analyzed the accounts, told  Business. In a statement responding to the news, Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said, “We applaud Facebook for disclosing the existence of these fake accounts and shutting them down. … [But] Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform. If Facebook is truly committed to protecting the integrity of our elections, they would immediately take down Trump’s ads that attempt to gaslight the American people.” Nimmo also observed attacks on other candidates, including Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but said those attacks seemed more the result of “character building” in which the accounts were sharing content to bolster their respective personas – for instance, liberal-looking accounts attacked Trump, while conservative-looking accounts posted negative content about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Her son was killed — then came the Russian trolls “Among the accounts focused on black activism, there was strong support for Bernie Sanders along with a moderate amount of content opposing Kamala Harris,” Graphika said in its analysis. “Education reform and student debt relief were two of the most commonly mentioned reasons for supporting Sanders, while Harris’s record as a California DA was mentioned as a reason to oppose her candidacy. Mixed in with these was a small amount of content attacking Joe Biden, primarily due to gaffes related to his previous handling of racial issues.” Nimmo said the accounts sent just under 75,000 posts, the majority of which were not directly related to the 2020 election, but to broader political and social issues in the US. Facebook said Monday those behind the operation had taken steps to conceal their identities and locations. The company did not publicly say how it had determined the accounts were linked to the Internet Research Agency but said it had shared details with law enforcement. The campaign mostly recycled existing memes and posts from real American news organizations and political groups. “This wasn’t Russians targeting Americans with Russian content, this was Russians targeting Americans with American content,” Nimmo said. The decision to recycle existing content, rather than create new material, might have been part of the campaign’s strategy to conceal its Russian links, Nimmo said. However, errors in some of the accounts’ posts suggested the accounts weren’t run by native English speakers. “What the future for their children will be?” the caption read on one post apparently criticizing Americans who don’t remember the Confederacy fondly. Another account posted “What a bullsh**.” From Russia with Love? Mystery Facebook account sent New York activist a bunch of roses Nathaniel Gleicher, who leads Facebook’s team investigating foreign influence operations, said the company had caught the operation in its early stages and that the Russian group had been focusing on audience building. Gleicher said the accounts were “trying to make themselves look like ordinary citizens” in a way that could later have lent credibility to their posts. Facebook has taken extensive steps to crack down on foreign disinformation on its platforms since the 2016 election, including hiring former intelligence officials to root out campaigns like those run from Russia. Gleicher said that the steps Facebook had taken appeared to make it difficult for the Russian accounts “to build the following among authentic communities.” “People in Russia are still trying this,” Nimmo told  Business on Monday. But, he said, they are finding it a lot harder because the social media companies “are hunting them.” “In 2016, you could have set up an account posing as a Tennessee Republican and have it registered to a Russian phone number,” he noted. Facebook also announced Monday that it had removed several networks of Iranian accounts, some of which targeted Americans. One of the accounts directed audiences to content about Black Lives Matter – a tactic that was very popular among the Russian trolls in 2016. The network had a relatively small following of more than 7,000 accounts. While most of the focus on online foreign interference in the US has been devoted to Russia, over the past 12 months, Facebook has detected multiple Iranian campaigns targeting the United States. ’s Sarah Mucha contributed reporting.

        "articles": "Donald Trump believes the world would be better off if dictators like Saddam Hussein and Moammar Gadhafi were still in power Both Gadhafi and Hussein committed atrocities against their own people Donald Trump believes the world would be much better off if ruthless dictators like Saddam Hussein and Moammar Gadhafi were still in power. “100%,” Trump replied when asked that question in an interview with ’s Jake Tapper that aired Sunday on “State of the Union.” Trump said he believes Iraq and Libya, the respective countries of the since-deceased dictators, would be less fractured and promote a more stable Middle East if the two had not been forcefully pushed out of power. Hussein fell from power following the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and Gadhafi was ousted following violent civil strife in 2011 that ultimately drew a NATO-led military intervention. “I mean, look at Libya. Look at Iraq. Iraq used to be no terrorists. He (Hussein) would kill the terrorists immediately, which is like now it’s the Harvard of terrorism,” Trump said. “If you look at Iraq from years ago, I’m not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy, but it was a lot better than it is right now. Right now, Iraq is a training ground for terrorists. Right now Libya, nobody even knows Libya, frankly there is no Iraq and there is no Libya. It’s all broken up. They have no control. Nobody knows what’s going on.” RELATED: Trump says he will be ‘a great unifier’ Both Gadhafi and Hussein committed atrocities against their own people and were among the world’s worst human rights abusers. NATO decided to intervene in Libya as Gadhafi appeared poised to commit a genocidal-like massacre. But Trump said human rights abuses continue to plague Libya and Iraq and claimed, “They’re worse than they ever were.” “People are getting their heads chopped off, they’re being drowned. Right now, they are far worse than they were, ever, under Saddam Hussein or Gadhafi,” he said. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

        "articles": "Follow us: We're no longer maintaining this page. For the latest business news and markets data, please visit  Business That's because those laws included four key tax measures that went into effect for tax year 2013. Who'll be hit hardest? Those who make 7-figures with substantial wage and investment income. Households with incomes over $1 million could pay about $170,000 more on average than they did in tax year 2012, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center. Those making between $500,000 and $1 million would likely pay an average of $15,000 more. Plenty of taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000 also could be affected by some of the changes. Here's where the increases will come from: 1. Higher top income tax rate For those with taxable income over $400,000 ($450,000 if married), their top income tax rate is now 39.6%, up from 35% previously. 2. Higher capital gains and dividend tax rates For those making over $400,000 ($450,000 if married), their rate on dividends and long-term capital gains is now 20%, up from 15% previously. 3. Higher Medicare taxes For those making over $200,000 ($250,000 if married), their Medicare taxes will go up on their wages and, for the first time, their investment income will be subject to a Medicare tax as well. On wages: They will pay another 0.9 percentage points of Medicare tax on wage income over $200,000 ($250,000 if married). That's on top of the 1.45% Medicare tax that they must pay on all their wages (or 2.9% if they're self-employed). So, for example, a single bank executive making $500,000 in wages - which is $300,000 above the applicable threshold - would have to pay an additional $2,700 in Medicare taxes (0.9% x $300,000) Related: Obama wants to curb retirement tax breaks for the rich On investments: Some or all of their taxable capital gains, dividends, interest, rental income and annuities will be subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax. But just how much will be subject to tax will take some figuring. Good thing they can afford an accountant. Here's how it would work: The 3.8% tax applies to whichever is less -- their taxable investment income or the amount that their modified adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds the $200,000/$250,000 threshold. Say a married couple has a modified AGI of $350,000 - which exceeds the applicable threshold by $100,000 - and investment income of $150,000. They'd owe the 3.8% surtax on the lesser of those two. So their additional tax would be $3,800 (3.8% x $100,000). It will come as a relief to many that capital gains from a home sale up to $250,000 for an individual and $500,000 for a married couple remain tax free. 4. Limits on deductions For those whose AGI is over $250,000 ($300,000 if married) they could see the value of their personal exemptions and certain itemized deductions reduced because Congress reinstated the so-called PEP and Pease limitations. Personal exemptions are reduced by 2% for each $2,500 that one's AGI tops the $250,000/$300,000 threshold. The value of certain itemized deductions is reduced by 3% of the amount that one's AGI tops the income threshold. But the total reduction may not exceed 80% of the deductions' value.

        "articles": "Sen. Jeff Merkley released a document Tuesday showing a transfer of nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and accused President Donald Trump’s administration of diverting funds from hurricane relief just as hurricane season was starting. However, the document from the Department of Homeland Security specifically mentions the money would come from the agency’s budgets for travel, training, public engagement and information technology work. The department denies that the money came from disaster relief funding. Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, said on MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show” that the administration is taking money from “response and recovery” and “working hard to find funds for additional detention camps.” “I would dispute the statement that this has no bearing on … addressing the challenges from hurricanes,” Merkley said.  received a copy of the document from Merkley’s office. It details the effects the transfer would have on FEMA’s operations and from where in the budget the money would come. “FEMA will curtail training, travel, public engagement sessions, IT security support and infrastructure maintenance, and IT investments in the legacy grants systems for transition to the Grants Management Modernization Program,” the document reads. Merkley was one of the first lawmakers to bring the family separation crisis on the southern border of the United States into public view, when he tried to visit a detention facility in June and was turned away. He has continued to be a critical voice on the Trump administration’s immigration policy, which included separating families at the border when the administration decided to criminally detain individuals caught crossing the border illegally. The document shows the amount transferred from FEMA to ICE is a sliver of the agency’s budget. The transfer from FEMA to ICE is less than 1% of FEMA’s overall budget. FEMA’s budget originally was $1.03 billion, and the amount transferred was about $9.755 million. The document does confirm that the money would be spent on ICE’s detention facilities. “Without the transfers and reprogramming identified in this notification, ICE will not be able to fulfill its adult detention requirements in (fiscal year) 2018,” the document reads. Homeland Security press secretary Tyler Houlton denied that DHS shifted disaster relief funding away from FEMA. “Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts,” Houlton said on Twitter. “This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster.” He added, “The money in question – transferred to ICE from FEMA’s routine operating expenses – could not have been used for hurricane response due to appropriation limitations. DHS/FEMA stand fiscally and operationally ready to support current and future response and recovery needs.” Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster. The transfer from FEMA to ICE was a part of a $201.88 million shift in money toward ICE’s detention facilities by the Department of Homeland Security. Insufficient funding could require ICE to “release any new book-ins and illegal border violators,” and prevent ICE from deporting those who have violated immigration laws, the document reads. FEMA and nine other agencies under the Department of Homeland Security had approximately 1% taken from their budgets to be put toward ICE’s detention facilities. “ICE could also be forced to reduce its current interior enforcement operations, curtailing criminal alien and fugitive arrests – which would pose a significant risk to public safety and national security,” the document reads. House lawmakers were told about the decision to make the payment in late July. Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego told  following a meeting between DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on July 25 that each DHS department would be contributing toward ICE’s detention activities. “As an overall, the meeting was long on excuses and on misrepresentations and short on information and solutions … one thing we do know, they are taking 1% of every DHS department and putting that towards family detention and family separation,” Gallego said. ’s Tal Kopan and Ashley Killough contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Travel ban against citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries remains blocked Ruling from the 9th Circuit appeals court was 3-0 Trump reacts furiously to decision President Donald Trump’s travel ban will remain blocked, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday. The unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel means that citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries will continue to be able to travel to the US, despite Trump’s executive order last month. It is a significant political setback to Trump’s new administration and raises questions about how the courts will view his apparent vision for an expansive use of executive power from the Oval Office on which he is anchoring the early weeks of his presidency. Full text: 9th Circuit rules against reinstating travel ban “The government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States,” the judges wrote. “Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all.” The judges added that while “the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies… the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination.” Trump immediately tweeted his reaction to the ruling: “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” “It’s a political decision, we’re going to see them in court, and I look forward to doing that,” Trump told reporters in the White House Thursday. “It’s a decision that we’ll win, in my opinion, very easily.” Trump’s presidential rival Hillary Clinton celebrated the decision, tweeting simply “3-0.” 3-0 The states of Washington and Minnesota had challenged the ban. “Bottom line, this is a complete victory for the state of Washington,” said state Attorney General Bob Ferguson. “The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a unanimous decision effectively granted everything we sought.” Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell, who argued the case, responded to Trump’s tweet on ’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.” “The irony from our perspective is that we’ve seen him in court twice now, and we’ve won both times. It’s not like it doesn’t count until you get to the Supreme Court,” Purcell said. The Justice Department is reviewing the decision, it said in a statement. But given that the Supreme Court currently lacks its ninth member, there a real chance of a 4-4 split on the bench along ideological lines, which would have the effect of affirming the ruling of the 9th Circuit, inflicting a more permanent blow to the new administration. The legal drama over the immigration executive order was the first episode in what could be a series of legal challenges to Trump’s governing style and agenda and represents the first confrontation between his White House and the checks and balances of the American political system. The Democrats fighting the legal battles against Trump The judges addressed each of the Justice Department’s proffered reasons for reinstating the ban in great detail and rejected them all. Perhaps the most sweeping language came concerning the government’s vast claim of executive power. The court rejected that in strong language: “There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.” They added: “Although our jurisprudence has long counseled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution.” The administration also argued the states did not have standing – or the legal right – to bring the suit. But the court disagreed. “(A)s the operators of state universities, the states may assert not only their own rights to extent affected by the Executive Order but may also assert the rights of their students and faculty members,” the judges wrote. The court also chastised the Trump administration for failing to provide an explanation for how national security concerns justified an “urgent need” for the executive order to be immediately reinstated. It suggested the administration “could have provided the court “with classified information” but failed to do so. And while the administration had set forth a fallback argument in order to limit the scope of the temporary restraining order currently in place – arguing that if the judges were inclined to uphold the lower court’s decision to block Trump’s ban, then the ruling should at least be limited to people who have previously been admitted to the US – the appellate court was unconvinced. “It is not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the Executive Order. …The political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions,” the court explained. The court said that it had to look at the interest of the public. It acknowledged that the public had a “powerful interest” in national security and in the “ability of an elected president to enact policies” but that the states had a stronger argument. “The public has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination,” the judges wrote. Trump’s executive order bars citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. Trump issued the travel ban January 27, causing chaos, confusion and protests at international airports as the legal status of people in transition was suddenly thrown into question. Lawsuits have been filed across the country, but it was one from federal Judge James Robart in Seattle last Friday that blocked the travel ban nationwide, clearing the way for resumed travel from the seven countries. The administration appealed, and the three-judge panel heard oral arguments Tuesday evening via telephone and issued the ruling Thursday per curiam, meaning it is unsigned and there was no dissent.

Bush, heard the case. “The Trump administration has lost dramatically and completely,” said Jeffery Toobin, a  political analyst, on “The Situation Room.” Democrats applaud decision against Trump's travel ban “This decision will have a lot more public credibility because it is unanimous, and I think it complicates the Trump administration’s attempt, if they choose to make it, to disparage this decision as a political act,” Toobin said. The administration has not announced its next step, but Trump has previously indicated that he would take the case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary, a move that would set up a legal showdown of even higher stakes and visibility. Should it choose, before it goes to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department has the option of asking for an en banc review of the three-judge panel ruling among judges of the full 9th Circuit. ’s Stephen Collinson, Kevin Liptak, Sara Snider, Theodore Schleifer and Eli Watkins contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Editor's note: Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter @sallykohn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. () -- There is an imminent threat facing the people, economy and territory of the United States of America. A report by the Center for Naval Analyses Military Advisory Board calls it a threat to national security and a broader \"catalyst for conflict,\" domestically and worldwide. The admiral in charge of U.S. forces in the Pacific says it poses the biggest long-term security threat to the region. A comprehensive study, with 16 terabytes of data, documents how this threat will affect every single county in the United States â costing coastal cities billions and decimating crops all across the Midwest. Notably, the Department of Defense's 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, published in March 2014, doesn't even mention ISIS. But it frequently mentions this other looming threat -- climate change. As thousands of people are expected to join the People's Climate March this Sunday, September 21, in New York City -- calling on world leaders and businesses to take serous and urgent steps to reduce global warming -- the threat that climate change poses to the United States is both direct and undeniable. The rise in mega-storms like Superstorm Sandy is already hurting coastal towns and our economy, while the rise in temperatures is causing droughts in the Great Plains and Southwest. Scientists have shown these effects will only increase. Meanwhile, though American intelligence agencies continue to emphasize that they have not detected any imminent threat nor specific planning by ISIS to attack US soil, we are nonetheless marshaling our full political will and military muscle to \"denigrate and destroy\" this enemy. Why aren't we attacking climate change? Donald Rumsfeld, secretary of Defense under President George W. Bush, famously tried to distinguish between \"known knowns\" and \"known unknowns.\" Well, the threat of climate change is a \"known known\" but we have hesitated to attack climate change with all the robust power and focus of our nation while we have quite quickly and decisively mobilized against ISIS, the actual threat of which is clearly a \"known unknown\" at best. Why? Why are mobilizing our national will, treasure and muscle to so emphatically fight ISIS while generally wringing our hands about climate change? It appears the answer is simple: Republicans. As far as Democrats are concerned, while 65% see ISIS as a major threat to the United States, 68% believe climate change is also a \"major threat.\" This is in stark contrast to Republicans, 78% of whom see ISIS as a threat but only 25% of whom feel the same way about climate change. The 43-point difference between Democratic and Republican views on climate change is the widest division between attitudes over any of the threats asked about in that poll, as the National Journal pointed out. Republican political operatives and special interests have succeeded in making climate change taboo for their own base, instead breeding a skepticism that disregards basic facts and science. In 2006, 59% of Republicans said they \"see solid evidence of global warming.\" That was at a time when Sen. John McCain, who would go on to be the Republican nominee for president, was a leading champion for \"cap and trade\" legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But by 2009, only 35% of Republicans believed in solid evidence of global warming. Even though half of Republicans said in a poll last year that that climate change is a reality, the implications of that skepticism remain. Most importantly, the belief that human activity is the main cause of global warming has increased among Democrats (from 57% in 2006 to 66% in 2013) but decreased among Republicans (from 31% in 2006 to 24% in 2013). And if you don't think human activity caused a problem, you likely don't think human activity or policy or much anything else can solve it. Fully 7 out of 10 Tea Party supporters believe there is \"no solid evidence\" that the earth is warming. As we've seen across issues, this fringe but vocal minority has a disproportionate pull on politics. Although President Obama is using his executive powers to take steps to address the threat of climate change, it's no wonder we now have even Democratic candidates hedging their stances on the environment. Perhaps the political reticence speaks to the fact that while ISIS offers a clear and distant enemy to demonize, in the case of climate change the problem is largely us and our lifestyle -- or at the very least, the problem is our oil companies and other corporations no politician is eager to blame, especially not Republicans. Or maybe the objection stems from a sense that fixing climate change is just too expensive, even though that's not true. In fact a recent study found that addressing climate change will actually lead to economic growth, therefore in a practical sense not cost a dime. And either way, many Republicans didn't balk at the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which could top $6 trillion not including what we're now spending to fight ISIS. So maybe it's just a matter of political alignment. If we could bomb our way out of climate change, and thus use it as a rationale for bloating the already-bloated military budget, Republican voters and political leaders might then lead the call to action. Let's hope the hesitance certainly isn't that we have to wait for the climate crisis to wreak even greater havoc all around us before we act. Unlike ISIS, where the possibility of a future threat was enough to justify action, we absolutely know that climate change will strike America -- and that, unaddressed, the severity of that threat will only grow. It's a crisis we absolutely can solve --but first we have to acknowledge there is a crisis and act accordingly. Read Opinion's new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @Opinion.

For the latest business news and markets data, please visit  Business Naguib Sawiris, one of the region's wealthiest men, said he has identified two privately owned Greek islands that would be well-suited for the project. \"We have corresponded with their owners and expressed our interest to go into negotiation with them,\" Sawiris said in a statement. His idea to create a safe haven for the refugees was first branded as ridiculous by some, but Sawiris said he has received \"tons of expressions of interest\" from potential donors. \"I'll make a small port or marina for the boats to land there. I'll employ the people to build their own homes, their schools, a hospital, a university, a hotel,\" he said, adding he could employ between 100,000 and 200,000 refugees. Sawiris, the chief executive of telecom group Orascom TMT, said he would name the place \"Aylan Island,\" in the memory of the Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi, who drowned earlier this month trying to reach Europe with his family. Photos of his lifeless body washing ashore in Turkey sparked a wave of solidarity and outrage over how Europe has been handling the refugee crisis. \"It's the picture of Aylan that woke me up,\" Sawiris told . \"I said -- I cannot just sit like that and just do nothing, and pretend it's not my problem.\" Related: Today's refugee could be tomorrow's entrepreneur He is hoping to get more donations towards the project by setting up a joint stock company with $100 million initial capital. \"Anyone who will donate will get share in the company, thus becoming a partner in the island and in the project,\" he said. \"This way, any money put in will not be completely lost, as the asset (the island) will remain,\" he added. Sawiris said he is now seeking the Greek government's permission to go ahead with the project. Greek authorities said they have yet to receive a formal request. Sawiris said he was also approached by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the world's leading body helping refugees, in order to discuss other ways of possible cooperation.

He comes from a family of entrepreneurs; his brother Nassef is chairman of Orascom Construction Industries, one of Egypt's most valuable publicly traded companies. Europe is struggling to cope with the number of people trying to escape war and poverty. The number of Syrians seeking safety in Europe has more than doubled in the past year.

        "articles": "David Vitter says he will retire from the Senate at the end of his term Vitter lost the Louisiana governor's race Saturday to Democrat John Bel Edwards Sen. David Vitter’s political career is coming to an end, in part because the eight-year-old scandal of allegedly hiring prostitutes is proving, finally, to be too much to overcome. In political extramarital affairs, the mistress rarely emerges unscathed The Republican lost a deeply negative battle for the Louisiana governor’s office Saturday to Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards. As he conceded Saturday night after losing by 12 percentage points, Vitter announced he’s retiring from the Senate when his term ends, rather than running for re-election in 2016. Opinion: How to make a political scandal stick “I have reached my personal term limit,” he said. Vitter told his supporters that while “I came up short – you all were fabulous.” Photos: Public figures, private missteps “I’ve lost one political campaign in my life, tonight. And ironically, it’s the campaign and the political effort I am most proud of,” Vitter said. Edwards will succeed Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal and becomes the first Democratic governor to win election in the Deep South in 12 years – countering the prevailing narrative in recent years that Democrats have lost the ability to win in that portion of the country. Last white democrat from Deep South loses Congressional seat “This election shows us that the people of Louisiana in a time of deep cynicism about our politics, and also about our future, that the people have chosen hope over scorn, over negativity,” Edwards said in a victory speech Saturday night. The Democrat also thanked his supporters in a tweet. We won because of you. Thank you for voting to #PutLouisianaFirst! Thank you for the opportunity to lead our state. #lagov Vitter had been dogged from the start of his gubernatorial bid about his purported history with hookers. In the summer of 2007, he apologized for committing “a serious sin” after his phone number appeared on the client list of Deborah Jeane Palfrey, known as the “D.C. Madam.” Democrats tried to make it an issue in Vitter’s 2010 re-election bid. But in a heavily Republican year, he skated to victory. ’D.C. madam’ found hanged Running for state office, though, the charges stuck. A state trial lawyers’ group ran an independent spot prior to the October 24 all-party “jungle primary” hitting Vitter for the alleged past solicitation. Vitter limped into the runoff, finishing a distant second behind Edwards. A defeated Republican rival, Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne, endorsed Democratic candidate Edwards. Another vanquished GOP foe, Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, stayed neutral. The Edwards campaign hammered on the prostitution allegations relentlessly, capped by one of the hardest-hitting spots in recent political history. Going back to Vitter’s House days, in 2001, the Edwards television ad argued the Republican “answered a prostitute’s call minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers who gave their lives in defense of our freedom,” thereby choosing “prostitutes over patriots.” The price of public shaming in the Internet age Vitter’s campaign tried to change the subject by seizing on controversy over whether Syrian refuges should be allowed into the United States, in the wake of the Paris massacre. Edwards’ position, opposing resettlement on American soil, was virtually indistinguishable from Vitter’s, though he didn’t dwell on it while campaigning. Vitter’s defeat is a harsh blow in a once-promising political career. The Harvard grad and Rhodes Scholar had been seen as a rising Republican political force before the scandal broke. Vitter could seek re-election to the Senate in 2016, though Republican colleagues are hardly enthusiastic about that scenario, concerned his unpopularity could throw the seat to a Democratic opponent. Edwards brings a varied background to the governor’s office. A 1988 West Point graduate, Edwards served as an Army Ranger, among other duties, during an eight-year military career. After earning a law degree at Louisiana State University and working as an attorney, Edwards won election to the state House in 2008. Republicans seize Senate, gaining full control of Congress Once Edwards takes office in January, there will be 31 Republican governors, 18 Democrats and one independent. The Vitter defeat will have ripple effects in Louisiana politics. Two Republican House members, Charles Boustany and John Fleming, had openly angled for appointment to the Senate by Vitter, had he won. So has state Treasurer John Kennedy. Now each pol will have to stay in his current job. Republicans said they will keep control of the Legislature. “Despite a disappointing result in the gubernatorial race, we’re confident that our Republican Legislature and activists across the state will hold governor-elect Edwards accountable to his campaign promises of not raising taxes, protecting school choice and defending our conservative family values,” said Roger Villere, chairman of the Republican Party of Louisiana. ’s Eric Bradner, Steve Brusk and Steve Almasy contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "City vows to appeal; no \"change in tactics overnight,\" mayor says A judge says an outside monitor will be appointed to oversee changes A class-action suit claims minority men are stopped without reason Police officers testified that quotas forced them to make unnecessary stops A federal judge ordered Monday that the New York Police Department’s controversial stop-and-frisk policy be altered, finding that it violates the Constitution in part by unlawfully targeting blacks and Latinos. But city officials bristled at the contention that police racially profile suspects, and vowed to appeal the ruling, contending the policy has cut crime. “You’re not going to see a change in tactics overnight,” Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Monday, saying it would take time to implement the judge’s changes even if an appellate court doesn’t temporarily halt it. Asked if he hopes an appeal will delay the order until he leaves office next year, Bloomberg said: “Boy, I hope so, because I wouldn’t want to be responsible for a lot of people dying.” Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, ruling on a class-action lawsuit, wrote that the policy violated plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights barring unreasonable searches, finding that police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to June 2012 without reasonable suspicion. She also found evidence of racial profiling, violating plaintiffs’$2 14th Amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection. The police department had said that the policy – in which police stop, question and frisk people they considered suspicious – is used to deter crime. “The city’s highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner,” Scheindlin wrote. “In their zeal to defend a policy that they believe to be effective, they have willfully ignored overwhelming proof that the policy of targeting ‘the right people’ is racially discriminatory and therefore violates the United States Constitution.” NYPD Chief: Stop-and-frisk saves lives Coupling Monday’s ruling with a similar decision in January, she ordered that the policy be altered so that stops are based on reasonable suspicion and in a racially neutral manner. Among her orders: – She appointed Peter Zimroth, a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, to develop and oversee near-term reforms, including changes to the NYPD’s policies and training. – In a pilot project, NYPD patrol officers in five precincts – one per borough – must wear video cameras. The chosen precincts would be those with the most stops in 2012. “The recordings should … alleviate some of the mistrust that has developed between the police and the black and Hispanic communities,” and “will be equally helpful to members of NYPD who are wrongly accused of inappropriate behavior,” Scheindlin wrote. – Other, longer-term reforms would come after community input. NYPD: Names of innocent to be erased from stop-and-frisk records The lawsuit, filed in 2008, went to trial for nine weeks this spring. The lead plaintiff in the case was David Floyd, a medical student who was stopped twice – once in the middle of the afternoon when he was in front of his home in the Bronx, according to the suit. Another plaintiff, Leroy Downs, described to  how he, too, was confronted and frisked as he sat on the steps in front of his own home. “The officers drove past me, went up the street, reversed, came back, jumped out and they approached me,” Downs said, adding that the officers told him, “You look like you (were) smoking weed.” Downs said he told the officers, “Come on, I’m talking on a cell phone.” “They cursed at me and said, ‘Get against the fence,’ and started pushing me toward the fence and commenced to searching me,” added Downs. Police found nothing on Downs. “I’ve been so much of this throughout my life, that’s one of the reasons why I took part in this – I just want it to stop,” Downs said. David Ourlicht, also among those stopped, reacted to the judge’s ruling with tears and with an assessment: “This is a big thing for New York, but as far as for America as a whole, it shows the polarization of people of color in this country, as how we’re viewed.” In her ruling, Scheindlin said more than 80% of the stops involved blacks or Hispanics. The NYPD made more than 4.4 million total stops under the policy from 2004 to June 2012. She wrote that the NYPD carried out more stops where there were more black and Hispanic residents, at a rate disproportionate with crime rates. She also wrote that the department has an unwritten policy of targeting “the right people” for stops – encouraging, in practice, the targeting of young blacks and Hispanics based on their prevalence in local crime complaints. “No one should live in fear of being stopped whenever he leaves his home to go about the activities of daily life,” she wrote. “Those who are routinely subjected to stops are overwhelmingly people of color, and they are justifiably troubled to be singled out when many of them have done nothing to attract the unwanted attention.” Officers say they had stop-and-frisk quotas The city will ask the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to block the ruling until an appeal is heard, city attorney Michael Cardozo said Monday. The ruling hardly impressed Bloomberg and New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who called Scheindlin’s finding of racial profiling “disturbing and offensive.” “We do not engage in racial profiling. It is prohibited by law,” Kelly said. “We train our officers that they need reasonable suspicion to make a stop, and I can assure you that race is never a reason to conduct a stop.” The policy “is certainly a tool that every police officer needs throughout America,” Kelly said. “If you see something suspicious, you pay your police officers to ask a question, stop to inquire. To the extent that this significantly impacts on that, I think you’re going to have a problem, not only here, but across America.” Bloomberg said the policy was one of a number of programs that helped the city’s murder rate drop – it’s 50% below the rate when he took office nearly 12 years ago, he said. The mayor said “we want to match the stops to where the reports of crime are.” “One of the problems we have in our society today is that victims and perpetrators of crime are (disproportionately) young minority men – that’s just a fact,” he said. “If there’s any administration that’s ever worked hard on that, I think it’s ours … we’re trying to do something about it. “That has nothing to do with, however, where we stop people. We go to where the reports of crime are. Those unfortunately happen to be poor neighborhoods and minority neighborhoods. But that’s not the original objective or the intent or how we get there. We get there when there’s a crime reported, and we will continue to do that.” The trial, which ended in May, included testimony from men who said police stopped them for no reason and from police officers who say quotas forced them to make unnecessary stops. Closing arguments gave conflicting accounts of stop-and-frisk incidents. While attorneys for the city argued that one man was stopped because he appeared to be smoking marijuana, the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that he was simply talking on a cell phone. Another man was reportedly stopped because he fit the description of a wanted man in a high-crime area with a recent string of burglaries, but the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that he was more than a mile from where the burglaries occurred and that the last burglary in that area occurred more than 25 days earlier. According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, the Police Department logged its 5 millionth stop-and-frisk under Mayor Michael Bloomberg in March. ’s Sunny Hostin, Michael Tabb, Rose Arce and Marina Carver contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "The third Democratic primary debate, hosted by ABC and Univision, will take place on September 12. Presidential candidates had until late August to reach polling and grassroots fundraising thresholds set by the Democratic National Committee, which announced its official list of who made the debate on Thursday. Candidates needed contributions from at least 130,000 individuals, coming from at least 400 unique donors in 20 or more states. They also needed to reach 2% in at least four DNC-approved polls. 10 candidates met both thresholds, qualifying them for the debate scheduled for next month: ABC, the media partner in the September debate, also announced Thursday the podium order, from left to right: Klobuchar, Booker, Buttigieg, Sanders, Biden, Warren, Harris, Yang, O’Rourke and Castro. There were three other Democrats – Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, billionaire Tom Steyer and author Marianne Williamson – who said they had met the fundraising threshold, but won’t be onstage in the September debate because they didn’t hit the polling minimum to qualify. Steyer had three of his four necessary polls, Gabbard had two and Williamson had one. The remaining candidates in the Democratic field didn’t reach above 2% in any qualifying polls. The DNC required that all polls be conducted by an approved pollster, released between June 28 and August 28, 2019, conducted nationally or in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and/or Nevada, and fit a certain question structure. The candidates needed above 2% support in four or more polls of this nature, and they couldn’t have been conducted by the same pollster in the same region. The next goal for candidates will be the October debate, the date of which has not yet been announced. The polling qualifying period for that debate stretches for a longer amount of time – from June until two weeks before the debate – making it possible for candidates who did not make the September debate stage to appear in October. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Democratic presidential candidate Jay Inslee released a plan on Wednesday that looks to reimagine American foreign policy to combat climate change. Inslee squarely targets President Donald Trump’s foreign policy with the plan, charging the President with choosing “a cowardly path of ignorance” by “withdrawing America from the global climate community as the world hurtles toward the brink of irreversible climate disaster.” “We must adopt a new, aggressive international climate agenda – using all tools available in diplomacy, international finance, trade, aid, and assistance,” Inslee told . “We need to recommit to Paris with strengthened goals, pledging immediately to cut 50% of our domestic climate pollution by 2030 and taking action to get there. At the same time we must lead a global transition off of fossil fuels, and fundamentally shift American foreign and trade policy to help drive ambitious climate action around the world.” The plan rests on five tenants: The plan – titled the “Global Climate Mobilization” – is the third policy roll out from Inslee’s campaign that aims to link a range of issues to climate change, the issue that Inslee is staking his entire campaign on. Inslee, in early May, rolled out a sweeping plan aimed at combating climate change that, if enacted, would mean a wholesale change to the way the United States builds buildings, manufactures cars and supplies the power grid and includes a proposal to cut US coal production by 2030. And later that month Inslee unveiled a jobs plan that promises the creation of 8 million jobs over the next 10 years with a laser-like focus on combating climate change. Inslee’s plan would also see the United States join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which would commit the country to phasing out coal power plants by 2030, something Inslee promised in an earlier policy rollout. The Washington governor has staked his entire 2020 campaign on climate change and launched his bid pledging to make the issue – which he argues affects “every issue” facing the country – his focus as president. Inslee will continue that focus on Wednesday with a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York to unveil the new plan. Inslee argues in his new plan that the “question of whether the international community responds effectively to this challenge is one that will impact every American and will determine the lives, health and welfare of billions of people on Earth.” And Inslee’s prescription is that the best way to do tackle this issue is by ousting Trump. “Trump has chosen a cowardly path of ignorance, withdrawing America from the global climate community as the world hurtles toward the brink of irreversible climate disaster,” Inslee says in his plan. “Trump has built a foreign policy based on isolationism and xenophobia. And through his friendships with dictators, has deliberately sabotaged America’s domestic climate progress, and effectively handed US climate policy over to polluters and fossil fuel executives.” Inslee’s bet on climate change as a premier issue in the 2020 election could be a good one. Democratic candidates are often asked about the issue on the campaign trail, a signal that the issue is top of mind for active Democratic voters. And a recent  poll found that 82% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents find climate change a “very important” issue, ranking it at the top of the list ahead of universal health care, tighter gun laws and impeaching Trump. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "NEW: Protesters rally in Lansing, demanding the governor step down Gov. Rick Snyder apologizes for the crisis: \"I am sorry and I will fix it\" Flint residents' lawsuits put Michigan officials in crosshairs Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder vowed to do everything in his power to solve the Flint water crisis, asking legislators for $28 million to fund a series of immediate actions. Read Snyder’s plan He also apologized for the crisis during his annual State of the State speech Tuesday night. The Republican governor has become a lightning rod for criticism because the crisis unfolded under the state’s watch. “To begin, I’d like to address the people of Flint. Your families face a crisis, a crisis you did not create and could not have prevented,” Snyder said. “I am sorry and I will fix it.” The additional money would go to help fund the following, the governor said: Snyder spoke about the long-term consequences of the crisis, saying the $28 million request won’t be the last budget request for Flint. He also released a detailed timeline of steps officials have taken already and announced he will be releasing his 2014 and 2015 emails related to the crisis. See the timeline “No citizen of this great state should endure this kind of catastrophe. Government failed you – federal, state and local leaders – by breaking the trust you placed in us,” Snyder said. “You deserve better. You deserve accountability. You deserve to know that the buck stops here with me. Most of all, you deserve to know the truth.” The governor’s address did little to quiet his critics. “For those who think $28 million will begin to remedy the Flint water crisis, that is a fraction of the money city residents have paid for poisoned water that they cannot drink,” said Democratic U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee. Flint Mayor Karen Weaver has previously said the costs to undo the damage, both to infrastructure and residents’ health, could be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. “Flint deserves an immediate response equal to the gravity of this ongoing public health emergency. A state-appointed emergency financial manager created this problem and the state must step up and do more to help Flint families and children right now,” Kildee said. Outside where the governor spoke in Lansing, protesters gathered and demanded that Snyder step down. Tomeko Hornaday has been a resident of Flint for some 40 years. She said what’s happened there is an embarrassment. “Just to see the city of Flint just go down for the last decade, you know, with the crime, with no jobs, all the way down to us not having any water,” Hornaday said. “We’re angry. We want something done.” Instagram post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public. In April 2014, the state, which had appointed an emergency manager to Flint amid a financial crisis, decided to temporarily switch Flint’s water source to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure until a new supply line to Lake Huron was ready. How tap water became toxic in Flint The Flint River had long had a reputation for nastiness when the state made the switch, and a 2011 study had found that before water from the Flint River could be considered potable, it would need to be treated with an anti-corrosion agent, a measure that would have cost the state about $100 a day. Experts say that water treatment would have prevented 90% of the problems with Flint’s water. What is lead poisoning? After the switch, residents complained their water looked, smelled and tasted funny. Virginia Tech researchers found the water was highly corrosive. A class-action lawsuit filed last year alleges the state Department of Environmental Quality didn’t treat the water for corrosion, in accordance with federal law, and because so many service lines in Flint are made of lead, the noxious element leached into the water of the city’s homes. The city swapped back to the Lake Huron water supply in October, but the damage was already done to the lead pipes. The state is now handing out filters and bottled water with the help of the National Guard. 5 things to know about Flint’s water crisis An attorney representing Flint residents who are suing Michigan officials over what his legal team calls the city’s “lousy, no-good water” has a message for state officials targeted in the lawsuits: “Don’t fight it.” The state is responsible for the water woes Flint residents have suffered and continue to suffer as a result, and the only responsible thing the state can do is own up to it, attorney Michael Pitt said. High-level officials sued for tainted water in Flint “If you make the mess, you clean it up,” he said. “I’m reminding our elected officials of what my kindergarten teacher told me.” The three lawsuits seek individual damages for Flint residents – an estimated 500 and counting – who have complained of health issues and worry about future ailments as a result of the state swapping the city’s water source from Lake Huron to the notoriously filthy Flint River in 2014. Bill Goodman, another member of the legal team, explained to reporters the purpose of the three lawsuits: The federal lawsuit filed in November addresses alleged violations of the U.S. Constitution; the suit filed last week in the Michigan Court of Claims targets alleged violations of the state constitution; and the suit filed in Genesee County Circuit Court deals with what he called “grossly negligent actions by government officials.” During the discovery process, Goodman said, attorneys and their clients should receive within six weeks emails and other documents from various government officials, including Snyder, that could shed light on a critical yet heretofore unanswered question: How the heck did this occur? “We finally find out what happened. Stuff is revealed that hasn’t been revealed,” he said. Pitt added that the response to the federal lawsuit is due February 1, and that may provide some answers, but he encouraged state leaders to act promptly in providing money to residents who have been inconvenienced, sickened or worse by the water debacle. “They need financial aid. Water’s great. Filters are great,” he said. “But our people need financial aid, and they need it now.” He further lambasted state officials who, he alleged, learned of elevated lead levels in children’s blood in 2014 and did nothing. “They were staring at a public health emergency, and they sat on it for over 10 months,” he said, further criticizing leaders who assured residents the water was safe when they knew it wasn’t true. “I don’t know how many kids were poisoned because of these false assurances, but we’re going to find out.” Are you in Flint? Show us how you’re getting by without safe water. ’s Kevin Liptak, Joseph Netto and Michelle Krupa contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

The Democratic Party announced Sunday that Clinton won 700.47 state delegate equivalents (SDEs) to Sanders’$2 696.92 SDEs – a razor-thin percentage of caucus goers equal to 49.84%-49.59%. The party determined that Clinton lost .122 SDEs in the recounting, Sanders gained .1053 and former Maryland Gov.

Most House Rs agree w/ most Senate Rs and Americans. Trusting Obama w/ border security is like trusting Bill Clinton w/ your daughter #tcot — Cong. Tim Huelskamp (@CongHuelskamp) July 10, 2013 Huelskamp, who was elected in 2010 with tea party support, repeated the same comment to multiple news outlets, but described the statement as one that was made \"off hand.\" His comments represent one of the biggest issues in the immigration debate: trust. Opponents say they don't trust the Obama administration to secure the border, even if potential legislation passed by Congress includes provisions for tighter enforcement and prevention. It was a topic discussed in a lengthy meeting Wednesday among House Republicans on Capitol Hill, following the Senate's passage of an immigration reform bill late last month. In addition to border security, opponents of immigration reform also question the Senate bill's provision for a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. Some Republicans call such a measure \"amnesty.\" Huelskamp isn't the first to link a trust issue to Clinton. When Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, was running for the Senate in Missouri in 2006, she made a similar remark while talking about the former president on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"I think he's been a great leader but I don't want my daughter near him,\" she said. - 's Ashley Killough contributed to this report. @Anthony in California..........although I totally get your analogy, I for one, keep hoping that one day the coyote will actually catch that darned bird........wearing a rocket while on roller skates......how can that not work? what a nonsense and stupid analogy ,gop is sinking like concrete in the water. considering the GOP backed McCain and Gingrich who both cheated on their wives, and also re-elected Scott Brown – they might want to look in the mirror before casting stones Trusting Obama w/ border security is like trusting Bill Clinton w/ your daughter – Rep.

        "articles": "Hillary Clinton: 'We are moving closer to securing the Democratic Party nomination' Clinton's victory in Ohio on Tuesday was particularly sweet, coming one week after she suffered an unexpected loss in Michigan Hillary Clinton’s triumphant victory speech Tuesday night sent a clear message to Donald Trump: Bring it on. The former secretary of state emerged from “Super Tuesday 3” with at least four key victories in Ohio, Illinois, Florida and North Carolina and roughly 300 more delegates than her Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders. In Missouri, Clinton has a narrow lead over her rival, though the race is still too close to call. Who won Missouri? Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight In all, it was a jubilant evening for Clinton and her campaign after spending months fighting tooth-and-nail to keep in check Sanders’ insurgency in check. “We are moving closer to securing the Democratic Party nomination and winning this election in November!” Clinton said in her victory speech to supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, her voice noticeably hoarse. “Because of all of you and our supporters across the country, our campaign has earned more votes than any other candidate — Democrat or Republican.” Clinton turned her attention to Sanders, congratulating the Vermont senator for continuing to wage what she called a “vigorous campaign.” Clinton campaign defends Libya comment in face of RNC attacks But her remarks quickly switched gears as she turned toward a different presidential candidate: Trump, the Republican Party’s front-runner. Hillary Clinton's team Cautioning that sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office is the “hardest, most important” job in the world, Clinton argued that the president cannot succeed without seeking common ground. In a message that was clearly aimed at Trump and his propensity for polarizing and inflammatory rhetoric, Clinton said it was pivotal that the next president be able to “bring our country together again.” “If we reach out to treat each other with respect, kindness and even love, instead of bluster and bigotry, if we lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish together,” she said. Opinion: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are made for each other Clinton’s victory in Ohio on Tuesday was particularly sweet, coming one week after she suffered an unexpected loss in Michigan. Her narrow defeat there raised questions about whether the candidate had pivoted too soon to the general election and neglected to campaign as aggressively as possible for primary victories, sparking fresh concerns about more unanticipated losses. That defeat may ultimately turn out to be an anomaly given her wins in Ohio and Illinois. On the other side of the political aisle, Trump also had a good night. Six hours of Super Tuesday #3 on  in 2 minutes The New York billionaire won the Florida GOP primary, defeating Marco Rubio in his home state and forcing the Florida senator to drop his White House campaign. He also notched victories in North Carolina and Illinois. But he lost the other big contest of the evening – Ohio – to the state’s governor, John Kasich. It’s still not a given that Trump can reach 1,237 delegates needed to outright become his party’s nominee, and Clinton and her surrogates, too, were careful not to suggest that the nomination was in the bag. 2016 caucus and primary results But the results of “Super Tuesday 3” will allow both Clinton and Trump to pivot hard to the general election — and use each other to make their respective cases. “Obviously we are concerned about a Trump candidacy, as the Republican nominee, and take that very seriously and Democrats are going to have a big fight ahead of them,” Clinton’s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters Tuesday night. “And we believe she will be the nominee and will be prepared to take on that fight. But that is not up to us when this primary ends.” © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.  Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.",

        "articles": "\"I actually am amazed that she's borne up under it as well as she has,\" Clinton said The 42nd president said \"we're seeing history repeat itself,\" citing the Whitewater scandal of the 1990s Bill Clinton said Friday he believes Republicans are exaggerating scandals against his wife, using the scrutiny over her email use while at the State Department to tear her down. “I think that there are lots of people who wanted there to be a race for different reasons. And they thought the only way they could make it a race was a full-scale frontal assault on her. And so this email thing became the biggest story in the world,” Clinton said to ’s Fareed Zakaria in an interview that will air Sunday on “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” Bill Clinton's life and career “I actually am amazed that she’s borne up under it as well as she has. But I have never seen so much expended on so little. … I trust the people. I think it will be all right. But it’s obvious what happened,” Clinton added. The 42nd president said “we’re seeing history repeat itself,” citing the Whitewater scandal of the 1990s. He also said media coverage of his wife shifted from issues to politics by “people who want a race.” But, he added, “this is a contact sport. They’re not giving the job away.” Hillary Clinton’s bid for the Democratic nomination has stumbled as she grapples with questions about her use of a personal email account as secretary of state. Republicans charge that Clinton’s email practices put American national security interests at risk, and Clinton has been forced to share the documents on her private server. Those negative headlines seem to have taken their toll on Clinton’s presidential ambitions, as wide numbers of Americans say in polls that they do not find her honest and trustworthy. Democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders have seized on those weak numbers and captured an anti-Clinton sentiment peeking through the party’s liberal coalition. Hillary Clinton has so far avoided engaging with Sanders, only saying his name at a public campaign event for the first time earlier this month. But her husband threw some praise on the Vermont senator when contrasting the Democratic field with Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump. “Hillary and Senator Sanders have laid out pretty detailed, positive policy positions, talking about what they would cost and, you know, you could actually have a debate there,” the former president said. The same couldn’t be said of Trump, he said. Bill Clinton explained that he thought Trump was trying to provide an economic argument for working class, socially conservative Republicans to believe in the GOP. “I’ll give you an economic reason to vote for me: I’ll build a wall around the Southern border of America and I’ll stop buying Chinese imports so your incomes will go up,” Clinton said of Trump, referring to the Republican’s prominent policy positions. But he believes the brash billionaire will be forced to flesh out his policy positions in the coming weeks. “I’m sure the other future debates will do it,” he said.

        "articles": "CBP has long struggled to even keep up with attrition Trump has requested 5,000 more agents be hired Optimistic internal estimates say that it could still take five to 10 years for Customs and Border Protection to hire all the additional agents President Donald Trump has ordered, even if the agency gets a wish list of requests to make hiring easier, according to documents obtained by . CBP has long struggled to even keep up with attrition in its ranks, and was staffed below currently targeted levels even before the President’s January executive orders called for 5,000 more agents. CBP’s acting commissioner spelled out a series of steps the agency would need, either from other agencies, its parent DHS or Congress, in order to hire more agents in a memo for the deputy secretary last month, according to a copy obtained by . But even those measures would only help so much, the memo makes clear. The hurdles are just the latest practical difficulty faced by Trump’s attempts to substantially increase immigration enforcement in the US. His moves to vastly increase the number of undocumented immigrants detained and deported have rankled Democrats and spread fear in immigrant communities. In addition to his long-promised border wall, Trump has ordered a substantial increase in personnel, including the CBP surge. Some contents of the memo have been previously reported, including CBP seeking to alleviate some hiring requirements, but the full contents had yet to be released. Six barriers to Trump's border security plans In the memo’s conclusion, acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan wrote that if the requested changes were implemented, CBP “optimistically” would project a hiring increase of fewer than 450 border agents per year, from 485 annual hires to 917 annual hires. “This assumes an increase in yield rates for the BPA entrance exam phase, the polygraph phase and the fitness test,” he wrote. Trump has requested 5,000 more agents be hired, and McAleenan said the agency is already struggling with attrition. Given current staffing levels, CBP needs to hire 6,743 agents to reach Trump’s new goal. But McAleenan said attrition was 6% a year, meaning it would take 2,729 border patrol agents being hired annually to reach full staffing in five years. If there were no attrition, based on CBP’s projections, it would take more than five years to hire the nearly 7,000 additional agents at the optimistic rate, and CBP does not suggest it can do more than slow attrition. When the memo’s existence was first reported, a spokesman said standards would be maintained. “US Customs and Border Protection will maintain our current high standards of recruiting the best America has to offer,” spokesman Michael Friel said. “To meet our critical hiring needs, we are exploring ways to recruit individuals that the federal government has already vetted to work in sensitive positions, such as military and federal law enforcement officers while also working to omit redundancies in the hiring process.” CBP declined to comment further on the memo. Some of the requests in the memo include steps like having direct hire authority, self-regulating the mandatory polygraph that is one of the biggest obstacles in hiring agents, greater salary and pay authority, greater cooperation with the Department of Defense to hire veterans and authority to establish social media accounts for recruitment. From Congress, CBP would want legal authority to hire federal, state and local law enforcement officers who are in good standing and already have a polygraph from those agencies as well as veterans or members of the US Reserves or National Guard who have held a Secret-level clearance or hire, have had a background investigation and are otherwise in good standing. The agency has struggled for years to hire enough agents for its mission. In 2010, Congress passed an anti-corruption bill that requires all agents to pass polygraph tests to combat the possibility that they could be blackmailed, bribed or compromised by gangs, cartels or criminals. Congress has given CBP some flexibility, letting them hire veterans with a Top Secret-level clearance or higher, but CBP feels that has not been helpful enough. CBP estimated that the hiring plan would cost $328 million in fiscal year 2017 and $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2018. Trump to ask for border wall money — but only a little © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Do Not Sell But after widespread skepticism regarding her claims, Reid and her employer went further than most of those humiliated celebrities, providing analysis from her own cybersecurity consultant, who said that old, homophobic posts that appeared to have been published on Reid's now-shuttered blog were indeed the result of nefarious activity. Reid, a liberal pundit who hosts a program every weekend on MSNBC, said Monday that a number of posts unearthed by a Twitter user were placed online by an \"external party.\" The claim was met with immediate and widespread skepticism; the doubt shifted to derision on Tuesday afternoon, when a representative for the Wayback Machine, a digital archive that stores old content, said that a review \"found nothing to indicate tampering or hacking of the Wayback Machine versions.\" The backlash grew so severe that an LGBTQ advocacy group, PFLAG National, announced that it was rescinding an award it intended to give to Reid next month. But on Tuesday night, a spokeswoman for MSNBC shared several documents with Money, including a statement from an independent security consultant named Jonathan Nichols, who said he has \"significant evidence\" that some of the recently circulated posts are bogus. In his statement, Nichols said that he \"discovered that login information used to access the blog was available on the Dark Web and that fraudulent entries -- featuring offensive statements -- were entered with suspicious formatting and time stamps.\" \"At no time has Ms. Reid claimed that the Wayback Machine was hacked, though early in our investigation, we were made aware of a breach at archive.org which may have correlated with the fraudulent blog posts we observed on their website,\" Nichols said. \"We simply wanted to ascertain whether that breach was related to the compromising of Ms. Reid's blog.\" He pointed out that the inflammatory blog entries in question didn't have reader comments. \"If those posts were real, they would have undoubtedly elicited responses from Ms. Reid's base,\" he wrote. The MSNBC spokesperson also provided letters sent in December from Reid's attorney to Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which owned the site on which Reid's blog was hosted at the time of the disputed posts, and Internet Archive, which runs the Wayback Machine, to alert the companies of the alleged hacking. Money has reached out to Alphabet for comment. The MSNBC spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up inquiry regarding Alphabet's response. Nichols said that many of the posts in question were published at a time when Reid was hosting a radio show, and that the \"text and visual styling was inconsistent with her original entries.\" He added that \"some of the recently circulated posts were not even on the site at any time, suggesting that these instances may be the result of screenshot manipulation.\" Reid's attorney, John H. Reichman, highlighted what he said was another discrepancy in his letters to the companies, pointing out that Reid published posts on January 10, 2006 about the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito at 10:18 a.m., 11:34 a.m. and 11:41 a.m., but that the archive showed what Reichman described as a \"lengthy, fraudulent entry\" at 11:28 a.m. \"Ms. Reid did not have the superhuman blogging skills needed to do all of these posts simultaneously,\" Reichman wrote. A Library of Congress archive of the site shows that the \"lengthy\" entry contains only two sentences of text actually written by the post's author; the rest is a quote. The Library of Congress archive reviewed by Money -- which the Library says is created using a local installation of the Wayback Machine -- contains the disputed posts and lists them as having been archived on January 12, 2006. The documents provided by MSNBC to Money do not contain a letter to the Library of Congress regarding its archive. In his letter to Internet Archive, Reichman demanded that the site provide \"the information needed to determine how the fraudulent posts came to be included in the archived posts.\" He asked Alphabet for \"immediate assistance in determining how, when and by whom the Blog was hacked and the fraudulent posts entered.\" The controversy, one of the strangest in recent memory to ensnare a media personality, began Monday, when Mediaite reported on the blog posts, many of which contained homophobic sentiments. In one, the author wrote \"most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing,\" and that it is in the \"intrinsic nature\" of straight people to find homosexual sex \"gross.\" Reid told Mediaite in a statement that she \"began working with a cyber-security expert who first identified the unauthorized activity,\" and that she \"notified federal law enforcement officials of the breach.\" The claim was met with plenty of skepticism, at least in part because Reid had already apologized in December for other years-old anti-gay posts that appeared on the blog, which were found by the same Twitter user, @Jamie_Maz, who also unearthed this week's posts through the Wayback Machine. It didn't help Reid's credibility when the representative for the Wayback Machine rebutted her claim on Tuesday afternoon. \"When we reviewed the archives, we found nothing to indicate tampering or hacking of the Wayback Machine versions,\" wrote Chris Butler on the Wayback Machine's blog. \"At least some of the examples of allegedly fraudulent posts provided to us had been archived at different dates and by different entities.\" Butler said \"the point at which the manipulation is to have occurred, according to Reid, is still unclear to us,\" and that he and his colleagues \"let Reid's lawyers know that the information provided was not sufficient for us to verify claims of manipulation.\" \"Consequently, and due to Reid's being a journalist (a very high-profile one, at that) and the journalistic nature of the blog archives, we declined to take down the archives,\" Butler wrote. \"We were clear that we would welcome and consider any further information that they could provide us to support their claims.\" Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "articles": "NEW: The IRS targeting was more widespread than previously revealed The use of so-called BOLO lists to screen applicants has been halted Official: An ongoing IRS probe of targeting finds no evidence yet of outside influence The FBI and several congressional committees also are investigating The Internal Revenue Service targeted liberal groups as well as conservatives seeking tax-exempt status, a Democratic congressman charged on Monday after the agency acknowledged the inappropriate practice continued until last month. Rep. Sander Levin said the term “progressives” was included on IRS screening lists of applicants for tax-exempt status made available to Congress on Monday. It was the first confirmation that the “Be on the Lookout” or BOLO lists used criteria targeting liberal groups after an inspector general’s report made public last month said the IRS had used words such as “tea party” to determine possible extra scrutiny. Earlier, the first substantive review of the controversy by the IRS showed the agency used multiple lists of inappropriate criteria in assessing tax-exempt applications up until this month, more than a year later than previously revealed. Daniel Werfel, the IRS acting commissioner, provided no details of what inappropriate criteria were on the lists, but said “there was a wide-ranging set of categories and cases that spanned a broad spectrum.” No evidence of IRS political influence Tea party group wants justice IRS controversy revives tea party Photos: Key players in IRS controversy The practice of using BOLO lists in considering tax-exempt applications has been suspended, Werfel told reporters. Shifting polls contradict key deposition Levin’s disclosure that progressive groups also were targeted follows a liberal claim that their side also came under extra scrutiny based on political titles or other language in their applications. In a statement, the Michigan Democrat questioned why the Treasury inspector general who initially disclosed the IRS targeting, J. Russell George, focused only on BOLO lists that contained conservative labels. The inspector general’s report “served as the basis and impetus for a wide range of congressional investigations, and this new information shows that the foundation of those investigations is flawed in a fundamental way,” Levin’s statement said. A spokesperson for George later responded that the report focused only on BOLO criteria used to refer cases for extra scrutiny of potential political activity that would make groups ineligible for tax-exempt status. Conservative groups complained about their applications being delayed for months and even years, receiving demands for inappropriate questioning from the IRS. Republicans have claimed the controversy amounted to political retribution against enemies of the administration, an accusation denied by the White House and the IRS. In response to Levin’s statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp said the inclusion of “progressives” on a BOLO list did not prove that liberal groups underwent the same extra scrutiny of conservative groups cited in the inspector general’s report.  Poll: Did White House order IRS targeting? Political firestorm The controversy that became public last month with the release of George’s report ignited a political firestorm in Washington while fueling conservative mistrust of President Barack Obama’s administration. Use of some lists of conservative labels for further screening stopped in May 2012 when IRS officials were first notified of the practice. However, Werfel’s review showed that other inappropriate lists continued to be used until as recently as this month by the unit that handles tax-exempt applications. Werfel was informed on June 12, 2013, that other BOLO lists were still in use. He immediately suspended use of any BOLO lists by the unit that handles tax-exempt applications, his review said. He noted that his investigation, while still incomplete, found no evidence so far of intentional wrongdoing by IRS personnel, involvement by anyone outside the IRS or that targeting extended into other areas of the agency. “Several key leaders, including some in the commissioner’s office, failed in multiple capacities to meet their managerial responsibilities at various points during the course of these events,” Werfel’s report said. “Most notably, there was insufficient action by these leaders to identify, prevent, address, and disclose the problematic situation that materialized with the review of applications for tax exempt status.” Remember that IRS scandal … ? Five IRS managers have been replaced, from the previous acting commissioner whom Werfel succeeded to the head of the unit based in Cincinnati that handles tax-exempt applications. In addition, Werfel created an Accountability Review Board to recommend within 60 days “any additional personnel actions necessary to hold accountable those responsible” for the targeting disclosed by the inspector general’s report. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that Obama believes Werfel’s report “is an important step in ensuring accountability for any staff that acted inappropriately, identifies the failures in their systems that allowed the misconduct to happen, and takes a forward-looking systemic view at the agency’s management.” The White House ordered the review by Werfel when he started the job on May 22 in the aftermath of George’s audit that found targeting of some conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Werfel was given 30 days to complete the review, and the House Ways and Means Committee has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on the report, with Werfel as the lone witness. Read IRS watchdog’s report Series of investigations The targeting scandal and a separate inspector general’s report that documented wasteful spending on IRS conferences in past years have led to a series of investigations of the tax collection agency by Congress, the Department of Justice, the tax administration inspector general’s office and Werfel. The IRS admitted there was unfair targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status starting in 2010, but officials said the action was a bureaucratic shortcut in its Cincinnati office rather than an exercise of political bias. IRS targeting: Scandal or snafu? In his report that disclosed the misconduct, George said there was no evidence of a political motive. However, George is continuing to investigate the matter, along with the FBI and the congressional committees. Republicans argue the controversy is proof that the administration and progressive groups have been trying to clamp down on those who disagree with Obama’s agenda. Camp, a Michigan Republican, said Monday that the IRS “still needs to provide clear answers to the most significant questions – who started this practice, why was it allowed to continue for so long, and how widespread was it?” “This culture of political discrimination and intimidation goes far beyond basic management failure and personnel changes alone won’t fix a broken IRS,” Camp said in a statement that promised continued investigation. As part of his review, Werfel said 80 groups awaiting IRS action on their applications for tax exempt status for more than 120 days could self-register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations. McConnell: Obama administration marked by ‘culture of intimidation’ At the heart of the matter is what kind of organization can qualify for tax-exempt status. Regulations limit such status to groups primarily involved in social welfare activities, while political groups are considered ineligible. Confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the IRS, Werfel said. An IRS statement on Monday said the “safe-harbor” option for self-certification would apply to groups that “certify they devote 60% or more of both their spending and time on activities that promote social welfare.” “At the same time, they must certify that political campaign intervention involves 40% or less of both their spending and time,” the statement said. Applicants meeting those thresholds would get approval within two weeks of seeking self-certification, it said. Werfel said the IRS would continue checking on tax-exempt groups to ensure they were following the law. Earlier: What’s a 501(c)(4)? © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company.

        "articles": "Amy Mackinnon: Current asylum laws make it difficult for gay Chechens to seek refuge in the United States Restrictions, such as expensive travel visas, must be eased so they can escape persecution, detention and torture Editor’s Note: Amy Mackinnon is a senior editor for the crisis reporting site CodaStory.com. While based in Moscow, she oversaw Coda Story’s reporting on LGBT rights in Russia. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author alone. When the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta broke the news that gay men are being systematically abducted by security services and held in secret detention sites in the Russian republic of Chechnya, it shocked the world. This story highlighted a fundamental flaw in international asylum practices: If one of these men were to knock on the door of the US Embassy in Moscow and ask for asylum, he would likely be turned away. The men who have escaped have shared harrowing accounts of beatings, electrocution and humiliation. Their revelations have prompted condemnation from the United Nations, members of Congress and the State Department. But in a private meeting with US officials, the Russian LGBT network, one of the country’s largest gay rights advocacy groups, says it was told that if any of the Chechen men were to apply for US visas, they would “most probably” be denied. The men who have fled Chechnya face a Catch-22. While they have excellent grounds on which to claim asylum in the United States as persecuted members of a defined social group, they first need to secure a visa to travel to the USA or any country that recognizes persecution of LGBT people as grounds for asylum. Even for a simple tourist visa, they need evidence they have enough money to support their trip as well as work and family ties that would ensure their return to Russia. For someone who has fled one of Russia’s poorest regions – fearing for his life – this can be difficult, if not impossible, to prove. Hundreds may be left stranded and at risk in Russia. Over a month after reports first emerged of alleged abuse against gay men in Chechnya, Russian President Vladimir Putin backed an investigation into what he described as “rumors” about what was happening to Chechen men of “nontraditional orientation,” a Russian euphemism for gay people. Investigations are still underway. Journalist who exposed Chechen gay oppression The Russian LGBT Network says it is working with 80 Chechen men, 42 of whom have been evacuated from the republic to other parts of Russia. Having left Chechnya they are safe from the immediate threat of detention, but as long as they are still in Russia they risk being discovered by Chechnya’s tight-knit diaspora and tracked down by their families. Sevetlana Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian LGBT network, says the families of some of the men have already tried to find them. Chechen society is highly conservative, and LGBT people are at risk of “honor killings” at the hands of their own family. Zakharova adds that almost all of the men are hoping to seek asylum abroad. However, to date, the Russian LGBT network reports only nine have been able to do so. While the United States – and the 148 other countries that have signed international refugee conventions – is bound to assist those facing persecution, these conventions only apply to asylum seekers who have already reached American soil. There is no obligation to assist those who are trapped in their country of origin by the red tape of visa applications. It is a problem that is by no means unique to the United States or the experience of LGBT Russians. It is why thousands of refugees have risked their lives to cross the Mediterranean in the hopes of making it to the shores of Europe, where they can claim asylum. Without a European visa, flying is simply not an option. How I told Russia I was gay International refugee conventions were forged in the wake of the Second World War to deal with the thousands of displaced people within Europe, at a time when asylum seekers predominantly fled overland to neighboring countries. But since then, the nature of conflicts and persecution have changed, as have immigration policies. Visa requirements offer a discreet way for countries to indirectly limit the number of asylum seekers they take in. The financial and familial evidence required to secure an initial visa mean that the system often discriminates against the most vulnerable. It is a plight that I have seen firsthand. Between 2015 and 2016, I spent six months reporting on LGBT rights in Russia, and much of that time was spent following the story of Vika, a transsexual woman from Siberia. Ostracized by her family and discriminated against by potential employers, Vika lives an isolated life in total poverty. “I am an alien here. To everyone and to the government as well,” she once told me. Vika is desperate to leave Russia and claim asylum in Canada. If she was wealthy or had a job that enabled her to travel, getting a visa would be straightforward. But as a truck driver from Siberia, Vika is stranded. Activists: Gay men in Chechnya sent to torture camp Immigration and asylum policies are not immutable, and there are ways to offer safe passage to those fleeing persecution in Chechnya, if only there was the political will. Western governments could offer humanitarian visas that enable people like Vika to travel legally and safely to another country where they can apply for asylum upon arrival. The Russian LGBT network says it has been in discussion with the embassies of three European countries who are considering expediting visas for men who have fled Chechnya. There is also precedent for the United States to run in-country asylum processing programs, but their implementation is often dictated by political and diplomatic considerations. “‘It’s not like we couldn’t do it, it’s that simply we have chosen not to,” says Aaron Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a US advocacy group which works with LGBT asylum seekers. Russians are their second largest client group. When Russia began to clamp down on LGBT rights with the passage of the “gay propaganda” law, which makes it illegal to discuss LGBT issues around minors, Immigration Equality lobbied to have asylum applications of LGBT Russians processed in-country, but their appeals were denied. Even for those who make it out of Russia, their problems are far from over. In big American cities they may have to wait years for an asylum interview, while in the United Kingdom they can be subjected to humiliating and invasive questioning to “prove” their sexuality. While asylum is not a panacea for the plight of LGBT Chechens, it’s the least we can do until the law and culture shift in Chechnya. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company.

        "articles": "Drag queens strut, rainbow flags flutter in the breeze, and smiling marchers form heart symbols with their hands. From certain angles, the pride parade looks just like other such events held around the world, from San Francisco to Berlin, London to Taipei. But behind the glitter and glamor, there is a darker side to this celebration: Cher’s “Believe” blasting from the sound system isn’t simply music to dance to; it is there to drown out the boos, the bangs of flash-bombs and the chants of “perverts!” Because this is no ordinary pride gathering: It is the first-ever equality march in the deeply conservative Polish city of Bialystok, where the LGBTQ community’s increasing visibility has sparked a backlash. The northeastern city of 298,000 is located in the Bible-belt region of Podlasie, which is a stronghold of the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) and has become synonymous with far-right movements. “Many of the acts of xenophobic aggression have been committed in Podlasie compared to other regions in Poland,” Rafal Pankowski, from the anti-extremism group Never Again, told . The mayor of Bialystok, Tadeusz Truskolaski, an independent, is eager to change that reputation. Unlike some centrist and right-wing counterparts in Poland, who have attempted to ban pride marches from their cities – Truskolaski let the Bialystock event proceed – despite widespread criticism from officials in the PiS. According to one 2017 study by Poland’s Public Opinion Research Center (CBOS), more than half of Poles (55%) think homosexuality is abnormal but should be tolerated. Around a quarter (24%) believe it should not be tolerated at all. As the country gears up for an election this fall, the right-wing PiS is targeting what it calls “LGBT ideology” to fire up its conservative base. This hostile rhetoric has emboldened far-right elements in the country. The ruling party’s socially conservative message has also helped it in the national polls – it crushed a coalition of opposition parties in May’s European Parliament elections, winning 46% of the votes. Experts predict another victory in October’s elections and LGBTQ activists are bracing for the worst. Poland’s opposition is divided on whether to address the increased marginalization of the country’s LGBTQ community, or to cater to socially conservative voters. In February, Warsaw’s liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from the opposition Civic Platform (PO), signed a declaration in support of LGBTQ rights. But just months before, his PO colleague Krzysztof Zuk, mayor of Lublin, banned that city’s first pride march, citing security concerns. The march went ahead after Lublin’s Court of Appeals overturned the mayor’s decision. “The problem for PO is that if they embrace LGBTQ rights too much, they might lose some of their conservative electorates,” explained Volha Charnysh, assistant professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). That played out last Saturday. According to Hubert Sobecki, co-president of Warsaw-based LGBT+ organization Love Does Not Exclude, the Bialystok event was one of 24 such parades planned this year in Poland– a country where same-sex marriage and adoptions are illegal, there is no hate crime category for the LGBTQ community, and gay conversion therapy is legal. The pride marches reflect many urban Poles’ growing support for increased LGBTQ rights. They are also a defiant response to a rise in homophobic and transphobic rhetoric from Poland’s Catholic leaders, the right-wing press, and the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS). In June, tens of thousands of people took part in Warsaw’s pride march – said to be the largest pride parade in central and eastern Europe. But Bialystok’s pride marchers were outnumbered, four to one, by thousands of counter-protesters, according to local police. Nationalist football “ultra” fans, members of far-right groups and others packed the parade route and nearby parks. “Get out of this city,” yelled a group of men trying to break through the 700-strong line of riot police protecting the marchers. “This is MY city,” orange-haired parade steward Precel, 19, shouted back, warning marchers to watch out for rocks thrown by the counter-protesters. Dozens of LGBTQ marchers were physically assaulted before, during and after the parade, according to the Warsaw-based advocacy group Campaign Against Homophobia (KPH), the organizers of the parade, and witnesses  spoke to. Ant Ambroziak, a journalist from Warsaw, told  he was spat at and assaulted as he live-streamed the protest for work. “I have a friend who was assaulted before the march. He was punched in the face because he [was wearing] lipstick” he said. Another marcher was spat on and hit in the back, “all in front of my mother’s eyes, who started to cry and tremble,” Paulina Brzoza, 28, told . “They were hunting us down,” said Precel, who is gender non-conforming and prefers they/them pronouns, adding that they had been spat at and chased by a group of men. Michal Bilewicz, who researches the social psychology of groups at the University of Warsaw, said Poland’s socio-political environment had demonized diversity and otherness. “What happened Saturday is a consequence of political language and discourse which targets gay people,” he told . According to Urszula Boublej, the spokesperson for Bialystok’s mayor, there were about 32 protest groups registered for Saturday, the majority in opposition to the pride march. It included the far-right group All-Polish Youth, which took its name from fascist and anti-Semitic pre-war youth organization. Last year, its former head Adam Andruszkiewicz who went to college in Bialystok, joined the federal government as Secretary of State at the Ministry of Digital Affairs. Critics said the appointment was another example of PiS mainstreaming right-wing extremism, according to Pankowski. Both the PiS and the government refused repeated requests for comment from . Bialystok’s Archbishop Tadeusz Wojda told congregants to “defend Christian values” by attending a family picnic – organized by the marshal of Podlasie Artur Kosicki – or an outdoor prayer vigil. Kosicki, a PiS member, refused to speak to  at the picnic, which came replete with a military artillery display and bouncy castles. At the vigil,  saw hundreds praying, some on their knees, outside the grand Bialystok Cathedral, in which participants held a banner aloft that read, “reparation to god and the blessed mother for the sin of sodomy.” How the Stonewall riots inspired today's Pride celebrations The Polish Ministry of the Interior said they have determined the identity of 104 people who broke the law in Bialystok “with 77 people, actions have already been carried out in relation to committed crimes or offenses,” it added. A colorful history of the rainbow flag Interior Minister Elzbieta Witek, who is a member of the PiS, condemned the violence. “Officers ensure security regardless of the ideas, values and beliefs proclaimed by citizens. Any person who breaks the law… should know they can be held responsible,” Witek said on Twitter, Reuters reported. But according to research by The Warsaw-based nonprofit Campaign Against Homophobia (KPH), some 90% of violent incidents against people who identify as non-heterosexual go unreported, Miroslawa Makuchowska, head of the political division at KPH, told . “People who are attacked don’t want to report to police because they feel the authorities can’t do anything. They are traumatized and afraid of having to hear homophobic slurs,” Makuchowska, head of the political division at KPH, said. Precel, who has been toying with the idea of leaving Bialystok, said the attacks at the Pride parade may have hastened that decision: “I was born here, and now I am studying here, but now I don’t know how it will be in the future. “I don’t really feel safe in Bialystok.” © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "March 31 is big deadline for Obamacare enrollment, but November elections are true test To win, Democrats will have to change narrative that Obamacare is a failure Support for the health care law is divided along partisan and racial lines Democratic midterm turnout among minorities, young voters tends to drop Program note: John King and other top political reporters talk about the politics of health care, as well as what the next big political stories will be, on “Inside Politics,” at 8:30 a.m. ET Sunday, and at 7:30 a.m. Monday through Friday on “New Day.” This year’s first day of reckoning for President Barack Obama’s signature domestic initiative is fast approaching. The second is seven-plus months away. The big question: Will the math on the first have anything to do with the math on the second? March 31 is the first benchmark: the first big enrollment deadline for what Democrats prefer to call the Affordable Care Act. The second is Election Day in November. The administration is all but certain to fall short of its stated enrollment goal of 7 million. But after a disastrous initial rollout, crossing the 6 million mark by the March 31 deadline appears within reach, and the White House will make the case that it is a policy success that leaves the program on a firm footing. But whether the improving numbers can be used to reshape the political climate as it relates to the health care law depends on whether Democrats on the ballot this year in competitive races have the courage to more forcefully rebut the Republican argument that the health care law is a disaster. Christie gets in heated healthcare debate Inside Politics: ACA premiums to rise Poll shows support up for Obamacare Justices to hear ‘Hobby Lobby’ case on Obamacare birth control rule Nancy Pelosi sees a shifting tide. “I believe that it’s a winner,” the House minority leader said Thursday. But she then added the critical part: “That is a case we have to make.” Some of Pelosi’s point is personal: She was House speaker when the health care law passed, and it is a proud piece of her legislative legacy. Some of her appeal, though, is raw politics: She believes that Democrats who run from the health care law only help Republicans who are making it their focus in the midterm campaign. She is at the moment a lonely voice in making the case that Democrats should celebrate the law, not distance themselves from it. And the latest polling underscores her challenge in persuading Democrats in tough races – especially statewide Senate contests – to be more open, and aggressive, in promoting the law. A Pew Center survey released Thursday found that 53% of Americans disapprove of the 2010 health care law; 41% approve. Here’s a nugget in that survey that Pelosi could use to make her case: A majority of those who oppose the Affordable Care Act think politicians should enact fixes to make it work better. But most of the data suggest the issue will remain a potent one for the GOP. Though 72% of Democrats support the law, only 37% of independents and 8% of Republicans do. And the potency of the health care issue for the GOP comes into stark focus when you dig deeper into the demographic splits in the Pew data. Inside Politics: Putin's D.C. Sanctions Inside Politics: Why Not Texas? Inside Politics: Hillary's Distance Obama: Democrats get ‘clobbered’ in midterms In a midterm year, turnout among African-Americans and Latinos tends to drop significantly, something Obama lamented yet again Thursday night at a Democratic fundraising dinner. “In midterms, we get clobbered,” the President said, “either because we don’t think it’s important or we’ve become so discouraged about what’s happening in Washington that we think it’s not worth our while.” History suggests the midterm electorate will be older and whiter than in a presidential year, something that would tilt the scales – on health care and other issues – in the GOP direction. Consider this from the Pew health care survey: Seventy-seven percent of blacks support the law, as do 47% of Hispanics. But just 33% of whites support the law. And just 35% of those over the age of 65 support the law; 56% oppose it. In presidential years, when more younger voters and people of color turn out, the demographics favor Democrats. But this year, the GOP appears likely to have a demographic advantage and one magnified by the fact that those most likely to vote in November are least likely to support the President’s health care law. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "There's a reason it hasn't been done in 31 years The White House today went out of their way to show very publicly that this is now their ballgame The Trump Administration unveiled its long-awaited tax cut proposal – via Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn – on Wednesday. The proposal was light on details, and its political future in Congress was decidedly uncertain given the fact that it’s not clear how the tax cut will be paid for. In search of answers, I reached out to  Capitol Hill reporter – and the man with the best hair in the business – Phil Mattingly. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: What’s the big headline coming out of the Trump tax announcement? Mattingly: “Biggest tax cut in history” is certainly the one the White House, just a few days shy of their 100th day, is thrilled about. But I’d go with: The White House has now fully committed to the long, arduous, painful, and likely-to-fail process of tax reform (not very catchy or click-baity, I know.) That’s not a shot at the administration, or the Hill Republicans tasked with turning their principles (or some iteration of them) into a law. The reality is, tax reform is hard as hell. There’s a reason it hasn’t been done in 31 years. The White House today went out of their way to show very publicly that this is now their ballgame, and this is now their big push. So here we go. Game on. Cillizza: Hill Republicans seem skeptical. What’s the main concern and how broad-based is it? Mattingly: Put it this way, Republicans are very happy the White House wants to put a ton of energy behind tax reform – they’ll need it if they ever want to get something done. There are serious elements of the plan that track with what Republicans up here have been looking at behind closed doors. But the principles laid out Wednesday are A) super aggressive on the cut side and B) skimpy as all get out on the pay-for side. So for example, if you want to lower the corporate rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent, and lower the rate for pass-throughs (think small businesses, owner operated companies and a hell of a lot of other entities like law firms, hedge funds, etc.) to 15 percent, you’re talking about a cost of around $4 trillion. Now, some Republicans are very clear that they’re happy to rely on economic growth to make up as much of that as possible (history shows it’s right to be skeptical of that as a true avenue to pay for cuts.) But therein lie two problems. First, it shuts down the ability to really make broad-based changes to a system everyone thinks is broken. Second – this is as key as it is wonky – Republicans plan to move tax reform through that ever-popular budget process known as “reconciliation.” Positives: Only need Republican votes to get it through. Negatives: It can’t add to the deficit outside of a 10-year window. Now, if I’ve lost you on this, totally understandable, but the short of it is: cuts that steep, particularly without significant revenue raisers, would almost certainly be fatal in trying to do reconciliation (Haven’t lost you? You’re that one person out there who wants to read more about this? GOOD NEWS) Just to put a 30,000 foot button on it: House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have said they want real, permanent, game-changing tax reform. Ryan has put out a plan that is straight-up revenue neutral, comprehensive tax reform. Proposing cuts this steep, and not really giving much indication on how you’d pay for them beyond closing loop holes, cutting deductions and economic growth, makes it far more likely that the White House eventually settles on a “cuts only” strategy, which is the opposite of what top GOP officials want. Cillizza: Is there ANY circumstance you see where Democrats – even a handful – vote for something like Mnuchin and Cohn outlined today? Mattingly: No. Dramatic cuts with limited upside for Democrats and their constituencies doesn’t a bipartisan plan make. (Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, put it this way: “This administration is offering cakes to the fortunate few.”) Fun fact: the bill also repeals the state and local tax deduction. That’s a massive deal for states like New York, California and New Jersey. Yes, those are very blue states. (Though I’m sure that’s not breaking many hearts at the White House.) Truth is, Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady is reaching out to Democrats. He’s hearing them out. The possibility of an infrastructure fund being brought into this, or other very specific things Democrats want may lead some to come to the table. But there’s a reason Republicans are planning to move this through reconciliation. They aren’t planning on Democratic support. Cillizza: In terms of timeline, Mnuchin says he believes they can get this done by the end of the year. Feasible or pie-in-the-sky? And why? Mattingly: I would note up front that Mnuchin was saying for months that the timeline was August. For a signing ceremony. Of a full-blown tax reform law. Which was absurd. So credit where it’s due on his part in getting a bit more realistic about things. Mnuchin is now matching up with top congressional leaders. The goal is to get it done this year. I think the possibility they get something done this year is real. But full-scale, once-in-a-generation tax reform? It’s a super heavy lift. There’s a lot of chatter about an eventual fallback to just corporate cuts, which would sunset, and then address individual cuts later (otherwise known as “rates and dates” – think ‘01 and ‘03 Bush tax cuts) and I don’t think that’s out of the realm of possibility. (Of note: Ryan and Brady are deeply opposed to this fallback, primarily because as long as it sits out there as an option, it’s tough for others to commit to really going all in on comprehensive reform.) Cillizza: Finish this sentence: “The chance of something resembling this tax proposal passing the House and Senate is _________.” Now, explain. Mattingly: Slim-to-none. But that’s more a nod to the reality of tax reform (say it with me: Hard. As. Hell) than these principles necessarily. There is real appetite on Capitol Hill to do this. Brady talks about this like he’s about to line up on the coverage team for a Super Bowl kick off. But cuts this steep won’t fly. And tax reform, at its core, is pain, the goring of oxen etc. Interest groups live and die off these loopholes. And they will flood the Hill with the power (and passion) of a Russ Westbrook-breaking-free-in-the-lane-uncontested-dunk to ensure their status quo is maintained (even as they publicly rail against everyone else’s status quo.) That’s just a lot to overcome. But here comes the hedge: You have a GOP White House with a self-professed deal-maker extraordinaire who loves this issue in the Oval Office. You have a GOP House with a Speaker who has been deeper in the weeds on this issue than most members can dream of. You have a Senate Majority Leader who is thinking of and doing strategic things probably at this very moment that you, or I, or other Senators, probably won’t figure out for another six months. You have a Senate Finance Chairman who, when the opportunity presents himself, has shown himself to be a crafty deal maker. And you have a House Ways and Means Chairman who lives, eats and breathes this stuff and will genuinely do whatever it takes to get it done. Maybe, just maybe, they can catch lightning in a bottle. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.  Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.",

        "articles": "Rick Best served 23 years in the Army Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche graduated from college last year Micah Fletcher, hospitalized, wrote in a poem: \"This is what we must do for one another\" Dozens of people gathered on Saturday around a circle of flowers and photos to honor a recent college graduate and an Army veteran who were fatally stabbed on a Portland commuter train. The two men were killed after they intervened when a man allegedly yelled what “would best be characterized as hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions” at two women on a Metropolitan Area Express (MAX) light-rail train, Portland police Sgt. Pete Simpson said. A third victim, a poet, survived the attack, but is receiving medical treatment for serious injuries. A suspect, Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, has been arrested on aggravated murder charges. Federal authorities are trying to determine whether Christian will face hate crimes charges as a memorial with flowers and notes for the victims grows across from the train station where one of the men died. The victims’ families, friends and Portland residents gathered Saturday at a nearby grassy area. They shared a few words about their loved ones while others praised their courage. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche will be remembered as a hero by his family and many in Portland. The 23-year-old was just starting his career. He was a compassionate young man with many plans, his sister said at Saturday’s vigil. After graduating from Portland’s Reed College with a degree in economics last year, he began working at an environmental consulting agency. He had just bought a house and dreamed of getting married and having children in the future. “He was a hero and will remain a hero on the other side of the veil. Shining bright star I love you forever,” his mother Asha Deliverance, posted on Facebook. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, My dear baby boy passed on yesterday while protecting two young Muslim girls from a... His professors at Reed College described him as a man with a bright future. “I still remember where he sat in conference and the types of probing, intelligent questions I could anticipate him asking,” Kambiz GhaneaBassiri said in a statement sent to students by the college. “He was a wonderful human being. As good as they come. And now he is a hero to me.” On Friday, Namkai Meche was on the phone with his aunt, who told him to videotape the incident so he could send it to police, her aunt told  affiliate KATU. “I didn’t mean for him to try to be a hero and get himself killed, but he was trying to protect those two teenage girls,” she said in a statement. “He had his whole life in front of him.” As I'm sure some of you may know, my dearest brother was one of the men who lost their lives on the MAX in Portland... Rick Best always worked hard, tried to help those around him and seemed to have a heart for public service. After 23 years with the military, he joined his family in Portland’s suburb of Happy Valley. First, he became an electronics repairman and loved it because he could spend time with his children. Within a couple of years, he ran for a seat as county commissioner of Clackamas County. “I can’t stand by and do nothing,” Best said in a 2014 interview with The Oregonian. He wasn’t elected that time, but months later, he began working as a technician with the city of Portland. “He was a devoted husband who talked often of his family. He was a model public servant,” said David Austin, spokesman for Portland commissioner Chloe Eudaly. He was a dedicated employee and the first person his colleagues would go to for help, his supervisor told The Oregonian. Micah Fletcher, 21, is being treated in a hospital with serious injuries. His mother, Margie Fletcher, told  affiliate KATU that the knife missed his jugular by 1 millimeter. The station tweeted photos of Micah and Margie Fletcher. Micah Fletcher is in the hospital recovering according to his mom after being stabbed for standing up for 2 young Muslim girls. #LiveOnK2 pic.twitter.com/NTVNVwIwm8 “He’s in really bad condition,” she said. “I’m proud of him for standing up. I’m grateful that he’s here. It’s hard for me to say I want people to stand up, but two girls might be alive because of them.” She said her son has intervened for others before. “Micah’s always done that,” Margie Fletcher said. “I’ve always worried about it.” Fletcher posted a poem on his personal Facebook page Saturday evening: “I, am alive, . I spat in the eye of hate and lived. This is what we must do for one another We must live for one another We must fight for one another We must die in the name of freedom if we have to. Luckily it’s not my turn today” A photo posted with the poem showed a tube sticking out of Fletcher’s neck. The Oregonian reported Fletcher was taking the train to his job at a pizza shop. He won a 2013 poetry competition with a poem against anti-Muslim prejudice, the newspaper said. ’s Jay Croft and Joe Sutton contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Do Not Sell A well-placed source said Tuesday afternoon that representatives for Fox and O'Reilly have begun talking about an exit. But this prompted a denial from sources in O'Reilly's camp. Even one person close to O'Reilly, however, said he will probably not be back on \"The O'Reilly Factor.\" The original well-placed source said an announcement about O'Reilly's fate was likely by the end of the week. The fact that none of these sources were willing to go on the record speaks to the delicate maneuvering underway. The network's parent company, 21st Century Fox (FOX), will hold a board meeting on Thursday, a spokeswoman told Money. One of the sources said O'Reilly will be a primary topic. The Murdochs, the men who control 21st Century Fox, are pointedly not commenting on any of this. But conversations inside Fox have already turned to possible O'Reilly successors. New York magazine's Gabriel Sherman, the author of a biography about ex-Fox News boss Roger Ailes, reported Tuesday that \"the Murdochs are leaning toward announcing that O'Reilly will not return to the air.\" Sherman cited \"three sources with knowledge of the discussions\" and said \"no final decision has been made.\" As Money has previously reported, there had been a split between Rupert Murdoch, the company's patriarch, and his sons James and Lachlan, with James advocating for O'Reilly's ouster. Lachlan was previously said to be in the middle. Sherman said Tuesday that Lachlan has \"leaned more in his brother James's direction\" in recent days. All of this is a reaction to a New York Times story about the settlement payments that O'Reilly, Fox and 21st Century Fox paid to women who accused O'Reilly of sexual harassment and verbal abuse. Last week 21st Century Fox confirmed that an outside law firm was investigating allegations against O'Reilly. The same firm -- Paul, Weiss -- played an instrumental role in the eventual resignation of Ailes last summer. O'Reilly's allies feel that he has been unfairly demonized by his accusers and a biased news media. His opponents, including some influential voices inside 21st Century Fox, feel that O'Reilly has behaved badly over the years, that his behavior has been exposed, and that it's inappropriate for Fox News to continue his show. \"The O'Reilly Factor\" is by far the highest-rated program on cable news. But most of O'Reilly's advertisers abandoned the show in the wake of the Times' story. O'Reilly began a pre-planned vacation to Italy last week. When he announced the vacation on air, Fox News and O'Reilly's own outside spokesman said he'd be back on the \"Factor\" on April 24. Guest hosts are filling in this week. O'Reilly remains in Italy while his team of agents and lawyers in New York work on his behalf. Some sources on O'Reilly's side said that, as of Tuesday afternoon, they still expect he'll be back on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" on Monday. But they acknowledged that none of them know for sure. Fox recently renewed O'Reilly's contract with the knowledge that the Times' story was in the works. The Times reported that the new deal was structured to give Fox \"more leverage over him regarding his behavior.\" That could be a factor in negotiations now. If O'Reilly does resign, or if Fox takes him off the air, he'd be the third major player to leave the network in the span of nine months. Ailes' resignation last July was the result of sexual harassment charges by women at the network, including Megyn Kelly, who herself left Fox in January. O'Reilly defended Ailes when the women first came forward. Kelly decided to leave Fox News in January. She is launching two new shows on NBC later this year. Fox's audience has remained extraordinarily loyal to the network amid all of the off-air controversies. And many of O'Reilly's fans are waiting for him to get back from vacation. But on Tuesday, Fox would no longer confirm his April 24 return date. When asked, \"Will O'Reilly be returning to the Factor on April 24?,\" the Murdochs' top spokesperson did not respond. -- 's Dylan Byers contributed reporting. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "articles": "At issue is whether federal benefits can be denied in marriages legal under state law A three-judge panel of a federal appeals court says no The appeals court notes it may ultimately be up to the Supreme Court to decide The law is being defended by congressional Republicans, not the Obama administration A key part of the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage was struck down as unconstitutional by a U.S. appeals court Thursday. The Defense of Marriage Act – known as DOMA – defines marriage for federal purposes as unions exclusively between a man and woman. Same-sex couples find their stride on wedding day At issue is whether the federal government can deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry. The ruling is a boost for gay rights advocates and the Obama administration, which in a rare move, has refused to defend a federal law in court. “If we are right in thinking that disparate impact on minority interests and federalism concerns both require somewhat more in this case than almost automatic deference to Congress’ will, this statute fails that test,” said the three judge panel. Same-sex marriage fast facts Powell endorses same-sex marriage 2012: NAACP endorses marriage equality Same-sex marriage an election hot topic The 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, based in Boston, did not rule on the federal law’s other key provision: that states that do not allow same-sex marriages cannot be forced to recognize such unions performed in other states. Traditionally, marriages in one jurisdiction are considered valid across the country. DOMA was enacted in 1996, when Hawaii was considering legalizing same-sex marriage. Marriage between two males or two females is legal in the District of Columbia and six states – Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York. It is set to become legal in Washington state next week and in Maryland in January, but in each state the implementation could be delayed by opponents placing the question on the November ballot. Many other states have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples, including New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii, a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law. But other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages. Lesbian couple can file for divorce in Maryland, court rules The appeals court said it recognizes how divisive the issue is, and noted it may ultimately be up to the Supreme Court to decide. But this decision is the first at this judicial stage to find the heart of the law unconstitutional. “Many Americans believe that marriage is the union of a man and a woman, and most Americans live in states where that is the law today,” said Judge Michael Boudin, appointed to the bench in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush. “One virtue of federalism is that it permits this diversity of governance based on local choice, but this applies as well to the states that have chosen to legalize same-sex marriage. Under current Supreme Court authority, Congress’ denial of federal benefits to same-sex couples lawfully married in Massachusetts has not been adequately supported by any permissible federal interest.” Chief Judge Sandra Lynch, a Clinton nominee, and Judge Juan Torruella, a Reagan nominee, joined in the opinion. It is in effect only within states with gay marriage laws covered by the 1st Circuit – Massachusetts and New Hampshire – and has limited enforcement. That means there will be no immediate eligibility for financial benefits currently denied same-sex married couples. No change is likely until the high court decides the matter. Massachusetts had challenged Section 3 of the law on behalf of a group of seven couples. Similar lawsuits have been filed across the country. Couples challenge Illinois law denying same-sex marriage DOMA is being officially defended in court by House Republicans, led by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who stepped in after the Justice Department refused to participate. The Obama administration announced last year it believed the law to be unconstitutional. A bill known as the Respect for Marriage Act is working its way through Congress and would repeal DOMA. Congressional opponents of DOMA hailed the court’s opinion. “It’s very good new for those who are fighting discrimination in any place, including in the area of marriage equality,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. The case was argued in Boston last month. The lawyer for the couples said states have long-standing authority to control and define marriage, and that Congress has no right to intervene through DOMA, clearly designed, said the lawyer, as “disrespect” to lesbians and gays. But Paul Clement, the private attorney hired by Boehner to defend the law, argued a congressionally mandated, uniform standard to define marriage for federal purposes is both proper and practical. Obama calls for marriage equality, says ‘I want everyone to be treated fairly’ Groups fighting DOMA were ecstatic at the decision. “All Massachusetts couples should be afforded the same rights and protections under the law, and we hope that this decision will be the final step toward ensuring that equality for all,” said the state’s attorney general, Martha Coakley, who in 2009 filed the initial lawsuit challenging DOMA. “As more loving same-sex couples commit their lives to one another in marriage, the harms of this unjust law become more clear,” said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, “from service members, risking their lives to protect ours, being denied the ability to protect their own families through military medical insurance or survivor benefits, to senior citizens having to move out of their homes after their partners of many decades pass on because they cannot access Social Security protections afforded any other legally married couple.” There was no immediate reaction from Boehner or the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group in the House of Representatives. But gay marriage opponents expressed confidence the Supreme Court would eventually reverse the ruling. “Society should protect and strengthen marriage, not undermine it,” said Alliance Defense Fund Legal Counsel Dale Schowengerdt. “In allowing one state to hold the federal government, and potentially other states, hostage to redefine marriage, the 1st Circuit attempts a bridge too far. Under this rationale, if just one state decided to accept polygamy, the federal government and perhaps other states would be forced to accept it, too.” The issue has been working along two legal tracks. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled against California’s voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage, arguing the ban unconstitutionally singles out gays and lesbians for discrimination. In a split decision, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the state’s Proposition 8 “works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians” by denying their right to civil marriage in violation of the 14th Amendment. Both the California and Massachusetts cases could soon be presented to the U.S. Supreme Court for review. The justices would have the discretion to accept one, both, or neither case – perhaps deferring judicial review until a later time, after more lower courts have had time to debate the matter. The case is Massachusetts v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services (10-2204). © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.  Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.",

        "articles": "Everything you need to know about bitcoin, blockchain, NFTs and more Correction: The original version of this article listed the former director of the Secret Service as a defendant; the actual defendant is the current director.  has filed a lawsuit against President Trump and several of his aides, seeking the immediate restoration of chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s access to the White House. The lawsuit is a response to the White House’s suspension of Acosta’s press pass, known as a Secret Service “hard pass,” last week. The suit alleges that Acosta and ’s First and Fifth Amendment rights are being violated by the ban. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday morning. It was docketed and assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee. The judge has given the defendants an 11 a.m. Wednesday deadline to file responses to the suit. He has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. Both  and Acosta are plaintiffs in the lawsuit. There are six defendants: Trump, chief of staff John Kelly, press secretary Sarah Sanders, deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine, Secret Service director Randolph Alles, and the Secret Service officer who took Acosta’s hard pass away last Wednesday. The six defendants are all named because of their roles in enforcing and announcing Acosta’s suspension. “This is not a step we have taken lightly. But the White House action is unprecedented,”  Worldwide president Jeff Zucker said in an internal memo to staff. Sanders responded to the suit by saying that  is “grandstanding” by suing. She said the administration will “vigorously defend” itself. (Read the White House’s full response here.) In a statement on Tuesday morning,  said it is seeking a preliminary injunction so that Acosta can return to the White House right away, and a ruling from the court preventing the White House from revoking Acosta’s pass in the future. “ filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration this morning in DC District Court,” the statement read. “It demands the return of the White House credentials of ’s Chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta. The wrongful revocation of these credentials violates  and Acosta’s First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process. We have asked this court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process.” The White House Correspondents’ Association said it “strongly supports ’s goal of seeing their correspondent regain a US Secret Service security credential that the White House should not have taken away in the first place.”  also asserted that other news organizations could have been targeted by the Trump administration this way, and could be in the future. “While the suit is specific to  and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone,” the network said. “If left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials.” Sanders pointed out that lots of other  reporters and producers have press passes. But to many journalists and press defenders, that’s not the issue. Echoing the views of many journalists, the correspondents’ association said the president “should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.” Trump’s actions and threats fly in the face of decades of tradition and precedent. Republican and Democratic administrations alike have had a permissive approach toward press passes, erring on the side of greater access, even for obscure, partisan or fringe outlets. The ACLU, in a statement supporting , said “it is un-American and unlawful for the president to expel a reporter from the WH briefing room for doing his job. It shouldn’t take a lawsuit from  to remind the president of the First Amendment.” On ’s side,  Worldwide chief counsel David Vigilante is joined by two prominent attorneys, Ted Boutrous and Theodore Olson. Both men are partners at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Last week, before he was retained by , Boutrous tweeted that the action against Acosta was “angry, irrational, false, arbitrary, capricious content-based discrimination,” and thus a clear violation of the First Amendment. In an interview on Tuesday morning, Boutrous said  tried to resolve the matter privately, but the White House was not responsive so “we really had no choice but to sue.” “We didn’t want to have to go to court. We wanted to just report the news,” he said. “Mr. Acosta wants to report the news.  wants to report the news.” ’s lawsuit cites, among other precedents, a 1977 ruling in favor of Robert Sherrill, a muckraking journalist who was denied access to the White House in 1966. Eleven years later, a D.C. Court of Appeals judge ruled that the Secret Service had to establish “narrow and specific” standards for judging applicants. In practice, the key question is whether the applicant would pose a threat to the president. The code of federal regulations states that “in granting or denying a request for a security clearance made in response to an application for a White House press pass, officials of the Secret Service will be guided solely by the principle of whether the applicant presents a potential source of physical danger to the President and/or the family of the President so serious as to justify his or her exclusion from White House press privileges.” There are other guidelines as well. Floyd Abrams, one of the country’s most respected First Amendment lawyers, said case law specifies that before a press pass is denied, “you have to have notice, you have to have a chance to respond, and you have to have a written opinion by the White House as to what it’s doing and why, so the courts can examine it.” “We’ve had none of those things here,” Abrams said. ’s suit makes the same point. Acosta found out about his suspension when he walked up to the northwest gate of the White House, as usual, for a live shot last Wednesday night. He was abruptly told to turn in his “hard pass,” which speeds up entry and exit from the grounds. “I was just told to do it,” the Secret Service officer said. Around the same time Acosta was denied entry to the White House grounds, Sanders announced the decision and claimed that he had behaved inappropriately at a presidential news conference earlier in the day. At first Sanders accused Acosta of “placing his hands” on an intern who was trying to take a microphone away from him. In reality, Acosta held onto the mic, said “pardon me, ma’am,” asked a followup question, then gave up the mic. On Twitter, Sanders shared a distorted video clip of the press conference that didn’t show the complete back-and-forth. The same video had been posted by an InfoWars personality two hours earlier. The White House’s rationale was widely mocked and dismissed by journalists across the political spectrum. And Trump himself has cast doubt on the rationale: He said on Friday that Acosta was “not nice to that young woman,” but then he said, “I don’t hold him for that because it wasn’t overly, you know, horrible.” In Tuesday’s response to the lawsuit, Sanders did not repeat her claim about Acosta “placing his hands” in the intern. Instead, she accused Acosta of being disrespectful and unprofessional. As for the argument that Acosta isn’t respectful enough, that justification “is not sufficient as a matter of law,” ’s lawsuit asserts. “The content and viewpoint of ’s and Acosta’s reporting on the Trump administration—not his interaction with the staffer at the November 7 press conference—were the real reason the White House indefinitely revoked his press credentials,” the suit states. Acosta is on a previously scheduled vacation this week. He declined to comment on the lawsuit. Since his pass was suspended, he has continued to do part of his job, contacting sources and filing stories, but he has been unable to attend White House events or ask questions in person – a basic part of any White House correspondent’s role. “Relevant precedent says that a journalist has a First Amendment right of access to places closed to the public but open generally to the press. That includes press rooms and news conferences,” Jonathan Peters, a media law professor at the University of Georgia, told  last week. “In those places, if access is generally inclusive of the press, then access can’t be denied arbitrarily or absent compelling reasons. And the reasons that the White House gave were wholly unconvincing and uncompelling.” Last Thursday, according to the suit, Zucker wrote to Kelly and requested reinstatement of Acosta’s credentials. Zucker’s message said that “no complaints were raised with  and there was no attempt to reach anyone at  before taking this unlawful action.” The next day,  sent a formal letter to the White House repeating the request and warning of a possible lawsuit. Over the weekend, Acosta reported on the president’s trip to France. Ahead of Trump’s planned visit to an American military cemetery, he requested and received a credential from the French government, but was denied access by the Secret Service. “It was not without irony to me that a U.S. White House correspondent who is an American citizen was denied access to a ceremony by his own government but was granted access by the government of France,”  Washington bureau chief Sam Feist noted in a declaration attached to the lawsuit. Feist said “Jim’s ability to cover a public event of historic international importance was completely blocked by the White House.” David McCraw, the top newsroom lawyer at The New York Times, said instances of news organizations suing a president are extremely rare. Past examples are The New York Times v. U.S., the famous Supreme Court case involving the Pentagon Papers in 1971, and ’s 1981 case against the White House and the broadcast networks, when  sued to be included in the White House press pool. The backdrop to this new suit, of course, is Trump’s antipathy for  and other news outlets. He regularly derides reporters from  and the network as a whole. But he also seeks out attention from  and other outlets. During his presidential campaign, Trump told  that, if elected, he would not kick reporters out of the White House. But since moving into the White House, he has mused privately about taking away credentials,  reported earlier this year. He brought it up publicly on Twitter in May, tweeting “take away credentials?” as a question. And he said it again on Friday, two days after blacklisting Acosta. “It could be others also,” he said, suggesting he may strip press passes from other reporters. Unprompted, he then named and insulted April Ryan, a  analyst and veteran radio correspondent. “The revocation of Acosta’s credentials is only the beginning,” ’s suit alleges.

        "articles": "The man arrested for allegedly pushing or throwing a boy from the third floor of the Mall of America in Minnesota had been banned from the mall in the past and once told police he had anger issues, court records show. Witnesses said Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, 24, either pushed or threw the 5-year-old boy on Friday morning from the third level of the Bloomington mall’s interior to the first-level floor nearly 40 feet below, police said. Aranda, whom police said took off running after the incident, was found inside the mall’s transit station and arrested. Authorities described the boy’s injuries as life-threatening and said witnesses gave him first aid. Police Chief Jeff Potts said he couldn’t reveal details about the child’s condition Saturday afternoon. “The child is still alive, he’s still receiving care, and I think we’re just asking for thoughts and prayers for that child to recover,” Potts told reporters outside his police department Saturday. At this point, police do not believe there is a relationship between the family of the child and the suspect, Potts said. Investigators are trying to figure out the motive, he said. “(Through) our investigative work and witnesses that we’ve spoken to, we feel confident saying that the suspect threw the child off of the third floor. But as to why he did that, is still something we’re looking into and trying to figure out.” Aranda is being held on suspicion of attempted homicide, and police expect to submit the case to prosecutors in support of charges by noon Monday, Potts said. Aranda lives in the Bloomington area and has had a series of arrests and convictions related to the mall. He had been banned from Mall of America in the past and was convicted of misdemeanors in two incidents there in 2015, court records show. Aranda was charged in July 2015 with causing damage inside stores after he threw items off the upper level of the mall to the lower level, court records obtained by  affiliate WCCO show. He was accused three months later of throwing glasses of ice water and tea at a woman in a restaurant at the mall after she refused to buy him food, the records show. In that incident, he got into a physical scuffle with the manager of the restaurant, sending panicked diners fleeing, according to court records that also note Aranda at that point had been banned from Mall of America property through early July 2016. In August 2015, witnesses saw Aranda smashing computers on the floor of a Minneapolis library, causing about $5,000 in damage, according to a 2015 complaint. Police were called and arrested him without incident after finding him at a bus stop across the street. Aranda in that case told authorities he got “angry after he read something on the Facebook” and so smashed five computers, screens and keyboards, court records show, citing a recorded statement. “He said he has some anger issues and told the officer that it does not happen all the time,” the complaint states. A witness Friday at the mall told WCCO that the child’s mother was screaming that someone had thrown her child from the balcony. “She was screaming, ‘Everyone pray, everyone pray. Oh, my God, my baby, someone threw him over the edge,’” Brian Johnson told WCCO. Mall of America officials said any more information about the incident will come from police. ’s Dakin Andone contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company.

        "articles": "Just as Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid picks up momentum, his David-versus-Goliath mission against Hillary Clinton is facing up to its first major hurdle as both campaigns tout their first fundraising hauls of the 2016 contest. Sanders, who’s enjoying a bounce in the polls and has 9,000 energized supporters the campaign says have signed up to “feel the Bern” at a Madison, Wisconsin event Wednesday night, is going up against the well-connected, deep-pocketed Clinton fundraising machine. For being the little guy who says he hates fundraising – so far it looks like he’s holding his own. As the fundraising quarter closed at midnight, it appears the Vermont senator’s campaign will turn in a relatively strong report. Sanders has raised roughly $8 million online, according to FEC filings from ActBlue, the organization handling his digital donation. His expected numbers will pale in comparison to the $45 million Clinton raised, an official with her campaign said Wednesday morning. RELATED: Hillary Clinton raised over $45 million in primary money, aide says If Sanders was running a traditional campaign, this could be a problem. Money is the lifeblood of presidential campaigns, not only practically, but symbolically. When the Federal Election Commission officially releases campaign’s quarterly reports in early July, the fundraising tally will be devoured for signs of strengths, weaknesses and momentum. But Sanders has far less overhead than Clinton, a point which is made clear each time he steps out of the backseat of a rental car at his campaign stops, surrounded by one or two aides. He doesn’t need to raise the same kind of money she is, because he’s likely to spend far less. Sanders’ aides said Tuesday they will evaluate when to release their fundraising number this week. But on a call with reporters ahead of a trip to Wisconsin, Sanders was already touting his fundraising efforts. “I think, as I understand it, we are going to have a pretty good campaign financial report coming out,” he said, adding that his campaign has “collected donations from some 200,000 Americans” from all 50 states. The average donation, Sanders said, was around $37. Sanders says he detests personally asking people for money and has made a point of telling his supporters that “billionaires” aren’t lining up to give him money. “Sitting around and talking to people at fundraisers, no, that would not be how he wants to spend a lot of his time,” said Tad Devine, Sanders’ top campaign strategist. “It is safe to say he would rather spend his time doing other things.” On the other side of the primary ballot, Clinton has personally headlined 58 fundraisers since announcing her campaign, according to  analysis. And some of the events have been lavish: One New York fundraiser featured a concert by Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett, while one this week in New Jersey included a performance by Bon Jovi. RELATED: Can Sanders fill the Warren void? Attendance figures provided by Clinton campaign aides suggest Clinton-headlined events have brought in at least $23 million. Her top aides and operatives have headlined dozens more. So far, according to his campaign aides, Sanders has headlined fewer than five fundraising events since launching his campaign in May (they don’t know exactly because they have happened so infrequently). One bright spot for Sanders will be the number of campaign donors, though. While Sanders’ is expected to boast 200,000 donors this quarter, Clinton’s campaign has said in email pitches to donors that they are aiming for 50,000 donors. Hours before the deadline, the Clinton campaign blasted an email under Hillary Clinton’s name with the plea for more donations. “I was a little nervous when we set a goal of 50,000 grassroots donations by tonight – but we only have 4,613 to go,” read the email. A Clinton spokesman later said that the 50,000 donations number they repeatedly quoted in fundraising pitches for the last few days was their goal from last Friday to the close of the quarter, not their three month goal. And when Clinton’s aides announced the campaign’s preliminary fundraising numbers, they didn’t include how many donations she received. Sanders’ campaign aides wouldn’t say what they hoped to bring in this quarter and have been lowering expectations for weeks since the campaign raised an impressive $1.5 million in their first 24 hours. But Devine did say that Sanders’ campaign hopes to have brought in $40-$50 million by the end of the year. RELATED: Clinton weathers the summer of Sanders “I think it is very important,” Devine said of the symbolic importance of Sanders’ forthcoming fundraising report. “One of the things we have tried to do is to demonstrate to voters in the early states, voters across the nation, to the press, to people who follow this process, that this is a real campaign. … If we can show people we are able to do that, that is an important step.” Sanders has experienced a recent jump in momentum, buoyed by a handful of good polls, including a /WMUR poll that found the Vermont senator was within 8 percentage points of Clinton in New Hampshire. This has particularly invigorated liberal Democrats looking for a Clinton alternative. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager, acknowledged this week in an interview that the recent uptick in polls has driven more attention to the campaign, and put more pressure on their forthcoming fundraising announcement. In light of the pressure, campaign aides have tried to use the more than likely fact that Clinton will out raise them into an incentive for more small donations. In an email titled “They’ll have to deal with all of us” on Monday,” Weaver asked donors for $3, even though Sanders’ campaign has “long suspected that other candidates are going to raise a lot more money than we will. That’s what happens when you have Wall Street and the billionaire class in your corner.” Sanders is well aware that his fundraising efforts are different than others, but has gotten behind efforts to make those differences a selling point. “We have [raised money] very, very differently than other campaigns,” Sanders said matter-of-factly Tuesday. “But I believe we will be able to raise, as will be indicated in this reporting period and in the future, enough money to run a winning campaign.” RELATED: Bernie Sanders: Obamacare not enough © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Poll reflects significant challenges for Democrats trying to keep Senate majority 65% of poll respondents call the current Congress the worst in their lifetime Voter enthusiasm is down, which could be caused by dissatisfaction with Congress Eight weeks before the midterm elections, a new /ORC International poll shows that voters in key geographic regions favor Republican candidates heading into November, highlighting significant challenges for Democrats trying to protect half a dozen vulnerable Senate seats and ultimately control of the chamber. Equally concerning for Democrats is that the GOP has a 15-point advantage with independent voters on the generic ballot, and Republicans have an edge at this point in supporter enthusiasm. While Republicans are all but assured of maintaining a healthy majority in the House, the GOP needs a net gain of six seats to control the Senate and its committees that oversee the Obama administration. Should the GOP control Capitol Hill next year, it would be positioned to direct the legislative agenda and influence President Barack Obama’s final two years in office. Harman: Time for Obama to turn crisis into opportunity Will Obama approval rates drive midterms? Congress wants a say in ISIS strategy Obama defers action on immigration Because of this, Democrats are desperately trying to protect at least five incumbents in Southern or heavily rural states such as Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, and North Carolina as well as an open seat in Iowa. Most of these races are considered tossups or the GOP has a slight advantage, according to state polling and analysis by independent political handicappers. Meanwhile, there is widespread belief that three other open Democratic seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia have already been lost to Republicans – putting the GOP within striking distance of the net gain of six seats needed to take the Senate majority. Lawmakers urge Obama to work with Congress on immigration Assuming Republicans maintain control of the House — Americans are split over which party should have control of the Senate with 46% supporting a Democratic majority and 42% backing GOP control. It is a different story in the South where a majority of voters, 51%, seek a GOP controlled Senate next year, perhaps making life difficult for Democratic incumbents in Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina. At the same time rural voters also want to see a GOP-controlled Senate by a 48%-37% margin that could have significant implications for Democrats in Alaska and Colorado. 5 key midterm races to watch Overall, Americans are angry with Capitol Hill, as a whole, with a whopping 83% saying they disapprove of how Congress is handling its job, while 65% describe it as the “worst Congress of their lifetime.” The current approval rating for Congress is 14%, just four points higher than the all-time low of 10% in a September 2013 /ORC Poll. This might explain why voter enthusiasm has dropped off significantly since the last midterms in 2010 – particularly among Republicans. Four years ago, 53% of Republicans said they were enthusiastic or very enthusiastic about voting, that number has now dropped to 37%. In 2010, 30% of Democrats were enthusiastic about voting – fast forward four years and that number has decreased two points. Challenges to predicting the November election result Despite the drop-off in voter enthusiasm from 2010, the GOP has an advantage in this category, according to the poll. And other data points show that Obama will not be helpful to many of the endangered Democrats seeking re-election. The /ORC poll shows that 52% of registered voters would support a candidate for Congress who opposes Obama, while 39% would support a candidate that backs the president. Democrats are hoping that candidates in Kentucky and Georgia are able take back GOP held seats, which would help the task of keeping the GOP net gain under six seats a lot easier. As for the overall electoral mood for the House, the GOP holds a 49%-45% edge over Democrats in the generic ballot question of which party would you vote for in your congressional district.

        "articles": "President Barack Obama has visited mosques in the past, but never inside the United States On Wednesday, the President visited the Islamic Society of Baltimore The move is aimed to respond to election cycle rhetoric that has attacked Muslim Americans President Barack Obama, in his first visit to a mosque in the United States, said Wednesday he was seeking to rebut “inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans” from Republican presidential candidates. Attempting to recast what he said was a warped image of Islam while encouraging members of the faith to speak out against terror, Obama described Muslims as essential to the fabric of America. “Let me say as clearly as I can as president of the United States: you fit right here,” Obama told the audience at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, a 47-year-old mosque with thousands of attendees. “You’re right where you belong. You’re part of America too. You’re not Muslim or American. You’re Muslim and American.” Obama to visit a mosque, and wade deeper into America’s war over Islam As he decried GOP counterterror plans that would single out Muslims for extra scrutiny, Obama insisted that applying religious screens would only amplify messages coming from terrorist groups. In his final year in office, Obama has sought to use his public platform – however waning – to advocate against what he sees as dangerous threads in the political discourse. “We can’t be bystanders to bigotry,” Obama said. “Together, we’ve got to show that America truly protects all faiths. As we protect our country from terrorism, we should not reinforce the ideas and the rhetoric of the terrorists themselves.” Describing conversations with young Muslim parents whose children are worried about being removed from the country, Obama demanded that people of all faiths be accepted without bias into the United States. “You could not help but be heartbroken by their worries and their anxieties,” Obama said of an earlier conversation with young Muslim community leaders. “Some of them are parents, and they talked about how their children were asking, ‘Are we going to be forced out of the country? Are we going to be rounded up? Why do people treat us like this?’ Conversations you shouldn’t have to have with children. Not in this country.” Obama to make first visit to U.S. mosque White House officials said Obama was looking to issue a forceful counterpoint to the language favored by some Republican presidential candidates like Donald Trump, who has proposed banning all Muslims from entering the country until tighter antiterror measures are put into place. But they also hoped to counter GOP claims that Obama hasn’t been forceful enough in demanding that Muslim leaders help root out extremism. Obama offered a calibrated message on that front Wednesday, citing the work of Islamic centers while identifying areas for improvement. “Here at this mosque, and across our country and around the world, Muslim leaders are roundly and repeatedly and consistently condemning terrorism,” he said. “And around the globe, Muslims who’ve dared to speak out have often been targeted and even killed So those voices are there; we just have to amplify them more.” In his speech, Obama cited a long history of Islam in America, and demanded more positive depictions of Muslims in American media. “We have to … lift up the contributions of the Muslim-American community not when there’s a problem, but all the time. Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security. It’s not that hard to do,” Obama said. Obama has visited mosques in the past, but never inside the United States, which is home to 2.75 million Muslims, according to the Pew Research Center. Before Wednesday, many Muslim groups had called for him to schedule a stop at a U.S. mosque as a public rejection of Islamophobia, the same way President George W. Bush did in the days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But for Obama, who continues to be dogged by conspiracy theories that suggest he himself is a Muslim (Obama is a Christian), a stop at an Islamic center proved far more complicated the first seven years of his term. A /ORC poll in September found that 29% of Americans said they believed Obama was a Muslim, including 43% of Republicans. He alluded to the conspiracy theories on Wednesday, saying the same rumors had plagued Thomas Jefferson. “I am not the first,” he said. “I am in good company.” During a meeting in December, Muslim community leaders lobbied top Obama aides, including senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, to schedule a visit for Obama to a U.S. mosque, an event the White House moved quickly to produce. “For young Muslims, I feel the President’s visit has a profound impact,” said Brenda Abdelall, the charities program director at Muslim Advocates, a group that had pressed Obama to visit a mosque in the United States. Abdelall attended Obama’s address on Wednesday. “Especially today, we worry about our own children who report being targeted. Being present and standing together, it’s not going to stop the bullying,” she said. But Obama’s speech, she said, “went a long way to share with everyone that Muslims are part of the fabric of America.” Still, many Muslim-Americans on social media proclaimed Obama’s visit too late in coming, using the hashtag #TooLateObama to dismiss his message as unwelcome. Obama entered office in 2009 hoping to repair relations with Muslims abroad, who felt targeted after American-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and infuriated by the use of torture on terror suspects. Months after taking office, he fulfilled a campaign promise to deliver a speech to global followers of Islam, traveling to Cairo and insisting the U.S. seek a “new beginning” with Muslim countries. While in Egypt he toured the Sultan Hassan Mosque alongside a veiled Hillary Clinton, then serving as his secretary of state. He’s also visited mosques in Jakarta, in 2010, and Kuala Lumpur, in 2014. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.  Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.",

        "articles": "Emma Sky: U.S. should never have invaded Iraq U.S. backing for Nuri al-Maliki was significant mistake, she says Editor’s Note: Emma Sky is the director of Yale World Fellows and the author of “The Unraveling: High Hopes and Missed Opportunities in Iraq.” She served in Iraq from 2003 to 2004 as the governorate coordinator of Kirkuk, and from 2007 to 2010 as political adviser to Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the commanding general of U.S. Forces in Iraq. The views expressed are her own. Addressing the nation from the Oval office on Sunday night, President Barack Obama outlined the current U.S. approach to fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Obama stated that we have been at war with Islamist terrorists since 9/11. However, the number of terrorists has proliferated since then in large part as the unintended consequences of policies the United States has pursued. Now, as the debate intensifies over how to respond to the group in the wake of the Paris attacks and the shootings in San Bernardino – and what kind of forces the U.S. and its allies should commit to the fight – it is worth looking at what led to the emergence of ISIS. The truth is, of course, that we should never have invaded Iraq in 2003. Yet nothing that happened in Iraq after 2003 was inevitable or preordained – numerous opportunities were missed to build a better future for the country after the invasion took place. The collapse of the state (through the Debaathification of the armed forces and the dissolving of the country’s security institutions) undoubtedly led to Iraq’s descent into sectarian war and created the chaotic space for the emergence of al Qaeda in Iraq. Yet even after these colossal mistakes at the beginning of the Iraq war, the United States still succeeded in midwifing the emergence of an inclusive political order from 2007-2009. So, as recently as six years ago, few could have envisaged that the Islamic State would rise up out of the ashes of al Qaeda in Iraq and take control of a third of Iraq. Iraq had emerged from its civil war, Sunni tribes (with the support of U.S. forces during the so-called surge) had defeated al Qaeda in Iraq, and there was optimism that the country was headed in the right direction. ISIS fight needs to go digital What went wrong? The turnout for the 2010 elections was high. Polls showed belief in the political process and optimism that the country was moving beyond the sectarianism that had bedeviled it. Iraqiyya, a coalition led by Ayad Allawi (a secular Shia), campaigned on a platform of “no to sectarianism,” and “Iraq for all Iraqis.” It attracted support from Iraq’s Sunnis, secular Shia, and minorities. And it won the most seats in the elections. However, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki refused to accept the election results. He called for a recount and used Debaathification to try to disqualify Iraqiyya candidates and to annul their votes. When that failed to give him victory, he further intimidated his rivals and pressured the judiciary, underscoring his determination to remain in power. There were differences within the U.S. system over what to do. Senior military officers who had served multiple tours in Iraq, along with diplomats with Middle East expertise, argued that the United States should uphold the right of the winning bloc, Iraqiyya, to have first go at forming the government in the belief that this could lead to power-sharing between Allawi and al-Maliki, or the selection of a third person to be prime minister. However, Vice President Joe Biden decided that the United States should support the incumbent, al-Maliki, for a second term as prime minister, apparently believing that he was a friend of the United States, an Iraqi nationalist, and someone who would give us a follow-on security agreement to keep some U.S. forces in Iraq post 2011. However, despite U.S. pressure, Iraqiyya adamantly refused to countenance a second al-Maliki term. After all, Iraqi politicians had spent the previous two years trying to remove al-Maliki through a vote of no confidence in parliament, fearful that he was turning into a dictator. It should have been no surprise they would not back him now. Iran, in the meantime, sensed an opportunity to outmaneuver the United States by using its influence to ensure a second al-Maliki term with the support of his arch-rivals the staunchly anti-American Sadrists – the condition being that all U.S. forces depart from Iraq by the end of 2011. In the region, people spoke of how Iran had driven the United States out of Iraq, and how the U.S. had given Iraq to Iran “on a silver platter.” Secure in his seat, al-Maliki accused Sunni politicians of terrorism, and drove them out of the political process. He also reneged on his promises to tribal leaders who had fought against al Qaeda in Iraq, arrested Sunnis en masse, and subverted the democratic institutions that were supposed to keep a check on his power. Sunni protests were violently crushed. All the while, the White House kept silent. It was clear to anyone who followed Iraq closely that politics were breaking down – not “breaking out” as a White House official claimed – as al-Maliki became increasingly authoritarian and moved closer to Iran. Furthermore, the capacity and willingness of Iraqi society to contain al Qaeda in Iraq was being eroded through the assassination, detention and flight of Sunni Awakening leaders, as well as the increasing politicization of the Iraqi security forces as al-Maliki replaced leaders who he suspected of being close to the United States with ones personally loyal to him. Yet when al-Maliki visited the White House in November 2013, President Obama publicly welcomed him, saying: “We honor the lives that were lost, both American and Iraqi, to bring about a functioning democracy in a country that previously had been ruled by a vicious dictator. And we appreciate Prime Minister Maliki’s commitment to honoring that sacrifice by ensuring a strong, prosperous, inclusive and democratic Iraq.” Within months of that visit, ISIS had taken control of a third of Iraq and the Iraqi army had collapsed. Ultimately, had the Obama administration not insisted on supporting al-Maliki – and ignoring his ruinous policies – then the inclusive political order that the United States had nurtured through the surge might not have broken down – and the resurrection of ISIS might have been prevented. We must learn from our past mistakes if we are to stem the proliferation of terrorism – and help set the conditions for ISIS to be defeated both militarily and ideologically.

        "articles": "On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order that sent 120,000 Japanese Americans to internment camps for the remainder of World War II. Now three Asian-American members of Congress are trying to ensure that something like that never happens again. US Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, along with US Rep. Mark Takano of California – all Democrats – have introduced a bill that would bar Americans from being forcibly incarcerated based on their race or religion. The Korematsu-Takai Civil Liberties Protection Act of 2019 is necessary to safeguard individual freedoms, especially at a time when President Donald Trump has made divisive comments about Muslims and other marginalized groups, Hirono said in a statement. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Duckworth added, “This important legislation would recognize the horrors faced by thousands of Japanese Americans as prisoners within our own borders by enacting new civil liberties protections and strengthening our resolve to ensure such a national travesty never happens again.” The bill was originally introduced in 2017 but died in committee. At least 12 other Democratic senators have backed the new bill. Takano believes Trump’s policies are motivated by similar discriminatory sentiments that spurred Roosevelt’s order two months after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, when many Americans were distrustful of those of Japanese ancestry. George Takei: On this Remembrance Day, I hear terrible echoes of the past “(Trump) showed very shallow knowledge of history by suggesting that maybe it was a correct thing to do to intern Japanese-Americans,” Takano said. “The anti-refugee rhetoric that he has described on the campaign and has continued to use in his presidency made it clear to me that he has a set a tone in this country of intolerance.” Takano believes the bill will pass now that the Democrats control the House, though he said this should not be a partisan issue. “It has to do with vulnerable minorities being protected from any kind of hysteria that’s worked by a demagogic political leader,” he said. “This is a very important piece of legislation that has been long overdue.” When the Supreme Court upheld Trump’s travel ban against several Muslim-majority countries last June, it also finally overturned a 1944 Supreme Court decision that ruled the incarceration of Japanese-Americans during World War II was constitutional. “The exclusion order was rooted in dangerous stereotypes about a particular group’s supposed inability to assimilate and desire to harm the United States,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the court’s dissent. The Korematsu-Takai Civil Liberties Protection Act is named after Fred Korematsu, an American citizen who challenged the constitutionality of the internment of Japanese Americans all the way to the Supreme Court, and the late Rep. Mark Takai, a Hawaii congressman who worked to spread awareness of the issue. Udall likens immigration crisis to internment Karen Korematsu, executive director of the Fred T. Korematsu Institute, commended the new proposed legislation. “This year marks my father’s 100th birthday and the 75th anniversary of Korematsu v. United States decision. At these milestones, it is a reminder that we must ‘Stand Up For What is Right’ and ‘Stop Repeating History’ by enacting a law that will ensure what happened to my father and 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry can never be done to anyone again in the US,” she said in a statement. In 1988 President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act, which apologized for the government’s actions toward those of Japanese ancestry during World War II and gave $20,000 to each surviving internee. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney, claims that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in which Russians were expected to offer his campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, sources with knowledge tell . Cohen is willing to make that assertion to special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources said. Cohen’s claim would contradict repeated denials by Trump, Donald Trump Jr., their lawyers and other administration officials who have said that the President knew nothing about the Trump Tower meeting until he was approached about it by The New York Times in July 2017. Cohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians’ offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen’s account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources. RELATED: Michael Cohen tape leak could complicate his legal troubles Michael Cohen tape leak could complicate his legal troubles To be clear, these sources said Cohen does not have evidence, such as audio recordings, to corroborate his claim, but he is willing to attest to his account. Cohen privately testified last year to two Congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. A source familiar with Cohen’s House testimony said he did not testify that Trump had advance knowledge. Cohen’s claims weren’t mentioned in separate reports issued by Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee. Contacted by , one of Cohen’s attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment. Trump denied knowledge of the meeting in a tweet Friday morning. “I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary’s lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!” Trump tweeted. An FBI raid on Cohen’s office in April sought information about taxi owners who had financial dealings with Cohen,  has reported. Rudy Giuliani, the President’s attorney, told ’s Chris Cuomo on “Cuomo Prime Time” Thursday night that Cohen has “been lying all week, he’s been lying for years.” “I don’t see how he’s got any credibility,” Giuliani added. Giuliani also said Cohen is “the kind of witness that can really destroy your whole case” and called Cohen, who was a top Trump Organization attorney for a decade, a “pathological liar.” RELATED: WSJ: Top Trump Organization official subpoenaed to testify in Michael Cohen probe WSJ: Top Trump Organization official subpoenaed to testify in Michael Cohen probe “Donald Trump Jr. has been professional and responsible throughout the Mueller and Congressional investigations,” said Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Donald Trump Jr. “We are very confident of the accuracy and reliability of the information that has been provided by Mr. Trump, Jr., and on his behalf.” According to people who have discussed the matter with Cohen, he has expressed hope that this claim about the Trump Tower meeting will help him reach out to Mueller and possibly lessen his legal troubles. He’s under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in Manhattan after Mueller referred Cohen’s case to them. The June 2016 meeting was arranged after a publicist who knew Trump Jr. told him in emails – in no uncertain terms – that a senior Russian official “offered to provide the Trump campaign” with damaging information about Clinton, and that the outreach was “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” At the time, the Russian operation to covertly boost Trump’s candidacy wasn’t publicly known. Trump. Jr. responded, “if it’s what you say, I love it,” and started to arrange the meeting. RELATED: The night Michael Cohen went to war with Donald Trump The night Michael Cohen went to war with Donald Trump At the meeting, Trump Jr. was joined by his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was Trump’s campaign chairman at the time. There were four Russians in the room, including a lawyer with Kremlin ties, a businessman who worked for an oligarch and a lobbyist with old KGB connections. After news of the meeting broke in July 2017, the Trump team offered misleading explanations and changed their story several times. But one claim stayed consistent: that Trump had no knowledge of the meeting beforehand, wasn’t told about it afterward and first learned about it one year later. Those denials were repeatedly issued by Trump, his attorney Jay Sekulow, Trump Jr., Futerfas and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Those people denied that Trump had contemporaneous knowledge of the meeting on more than 15 occasions, according to ’s analysis. Exclusive:  obtains secret Trump-Cohen tape Exclusive:  obtains secret Trump-Cohen tape Trump said on July 12, 2017, that he “only heard about it two or three days ago.” One week later, Trump repeated that he “didn’t know anything about the meeting” because “nobody told me” about it. Around that same time, ’s Jake Tapper asked Sekulow to confirm Trump’s claims that he only recently learned about the controversial meeting. Sekulow’s response: “Yes, I swear.” But perhaps the highest-stakes denial was given by Trump Jr. in his testimony last year to the Senate Judiciary Committee. “He wasn’t aware of it,” Trump Jr. told lawmakers, referring to his father’s knowledge of the meeting. “And, frankly, by the time anyone was aware of it, which was summer of this year, as I stated earlier, I wouldn’t have wanted to get him involved in it because it had nothing to do with him.” RELATED: Michael Cohen sent up flares, but Trump never came to help Michael Cohen sent up flares, but Trump never came to help Trump’s critics have long doubted these denials. They point to a series of phone calls Trump Jr. made to a blocked phone number before and after the meeting. They also note that two days before the meeting, Trump mysteriously announced plans to give a “major speech” about Clinton’s scandals. Trump Jr. says he didn’t get any dirt at the meeting – and the speech never happened. Even Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and top Trump campaign official, said the meeting was “treasonous” and speculated that “the chance that Don Jr. did not walk these (Russians) up to his father’s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero.” Trump Jr. has denied Bannon’s allegation. Bannon’s comments, to author Michael Wolff for his book “Fire and Fury,” triggered the bitter public divorce between Bannon and Trump in early 2018. Axios reported that Bannon does not have first-hand knowledge about whether Trump Jr. told his father, and Bannon later said his “treasonous” remark was directed at Manafort and not Trump Jr. UPDATE: This story has been updated with more comments from President Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "President Donald Trump sued California Tuesday challenging a state law that requires candidates for president to disclose income tax returns before they can appear on the state’s primary ballot. The federal lawsuit from Trump and his campaign is the latest move by the President to resist efforts to turn over his tax returns. The law adds an “unconstitutional qualification” to the fixed set of qualifications for the presidency set forward in the Constitution and violates the First Amendment, Trump’s lawyer William Consovoy argued in the lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the state’s “Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act” last month. “The United States Constitution grants states the authority to determine how their electors are chosen, and California is well within its constitutional right to include this requirement,” he said in a statement. A second similar lawsuit was also filed Tuesday by Republican voters along with the Republican National Committee and the Republican Party of California who argue that this a political maneuver that takes voting rights away from Trump’s supporters. Newsom responded to the challenge on Tuesday. “There’s an easy fix Mr. President – release your tax returns as you promised during the campaign and follow the precedent of every president since 1973,” the California governor tweeted. Legal expert Rick Hasen of the University of California, Irvine, said the state law is of “uncertain constitutionality.” “It is unclear whether state legislative power contained in Article II of the (US) Constitution gives California the power to take this step,” he said adding that the law might infringe upon the rights of political parties to select nominees of their choice. “If such a law is upheld as constitutional, we might see a race to the bottom whereby other states enact ballot access requirements, such as a requirement for candidates to produce a birth certificate, which could affect which candidates can run in which states,” he added. Trump’s team of private lawyers has been on the offensive in recent weeks filing lawsuits to thwart attempts by Democrats to see his tax returns. They’ve filed a handful of lawsuits in federal courts across the country, mainly to stop House Democrats from seeking the tax returns through the Trump family and company’s banks, an accounting firm or under a New York state law. Here's why Donald Trump might not appear on the California ballot in 2020 Trump has lost and appealed some of the court cases, but others, such as about the state laws, have not yet been decided. Later Tuesday afternoon, the Justice Department may take a position for an appeals court on whether Trump can stop House Democrats from subpoenaing an accounting firm for his tax returns from when he was a private citizen, according to a court order. ’s Katelyn Polantz and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Editor’s Note: Carol Costello is the host of “Across America With Carol Costello” on HLN. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. It is clear that Hope Hicks’ boss, President Donald Trump, does not care about women. And that includes Hicks. “It’s sad,” Mr. Trump said of accusations against alleged wife beater Rob Porter. “We certainly wish him well,” he said. “It’s obviously a tough time for him. He did a very good job when he was in the White House.” Porter, Mr. Trump’s staff secretary, may have done a bang-up job delivering classified documents to the President – without the benefit of an FBI security clearance – but his past, unbeknownst to the President, has thrown the White House into chaos. Trump hires in his own image -- bullies, posers, and bad boys But, the President seems more upset at Hicks, his communications director, for her role in the affair than at Porter. Hicks has been dating Porter and helped prepare a rather fawning statement in defense of him on behalf of the President. Sources tell  Mr. Trump is “frustrated” that Hicks let her romantic relationship with Porter cloud her judgment, even though her prepared statement was awfully similar to the glowing assessment Trump trumpeted to the nation. Thank goodness for Porter’s ex-wives. One of them, Colbie Holderness, provided pictures of the abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of Porter immediately after they got married. The pictures show a grim Holderness with one very black eye. “The thing he would do most frequently,” she said, “is throw me down on a bed and he would just put his body weight on me and he’d be yelling at me, but as he was yelling he’d be grinding an elbow or knee into my body to emphasize his anger.” Why men like John Kelly do nothing when abuse allegations surface Porter’s second wife, Jennifer Willoughby, also feared Porter. She was forced to take out a temporary protective order in 2010 to keep Porter away from her. She also thinks Hicks should run from Porter as fast as she can. “If he hasn’t already been abusive with Hope [Hicks], he will.” Porter has denied the abuse allegations. Perhaps President Trump is privately advising Hicks to cut ties with Porter, but if he thinks Porter is innocent, I have my doubts. Sadly, Trump’s support for Porter’s and Hicks’ silence on the matter is damaging Hick’s reputation. A headline inside People magazine reads, “Inside Hope Hicks’ Troubled Romances with Ousted Top Trump Aides Rob Porter and Corey Lewandowski.” The article details these affairs without any comment from Hicks, Lewandowski or Porter. Cue the slut shamers. On my Twitter feed, comments with the hashtag #HopeHicks about her and her love life are so disturbing, that I loathe to give them any more oxygen. It is journalistically sound to cite Hicks’ relationship with Porter because she reportedly crafted that glowing press statement for the President. If true, that was unethical and she should have recused herself. Does she deserve to be slut-shamed and only be identified by her “troubled romances”? No. Will it continue? Yes, yes and yes. And I don’t think the President will rush to her defense. So, run Hope Hicks, run. Save yourself. Not only from Rob Porter, but from President Trump’s obvious disdain for women. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.  Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.",

        "articles": "Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the section of Miami International Airport that will be temporarily closed. It is Concourse G. Miami International Airport will close a concourse early for three days because of a shortage of Transportation Security Administration screeners, airport spokesman Greg Chin said. Concourse G will be closed after 1 p.m. on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, he said. The airport has three terminals, which are divided into six concourses. “Due to an increased number of TSA screeners not reporting to work, we have decided to take this precautionary step and relocate about 12 flights to adjoining concourses in the afternoons,” he said. Twenty non-federal employees could be out of work due to the temporary closure of four dining locations and one gift shop in and around Concourse G, Chin said. It's still safe to fly. But maybe not, if the shutdown drags on Chin said Thursday that federal screeners were calling in sick at double the normal rate for Miami, and TSA managers aren’t confident they will have enough workers to operate all checkpoints throughout the airport at normal hours. “We felt we had to make a decision before the weekend,” Chin told the Miami Herald. “They’re erring on the side of caution.” The government shutdown has left TSA employees working without pay, raising concerns that airports might not be able to provide the usual standard of security. In a wave of what one federal official has dubbed as the “blue flu”– a nod to the blue shirts worn by TSA officers – hundreds of TSA screeners at at least four major airports have called out from their shifts since the shutdown began in December. Last week, TSA spokesman Michael Bilello acknowledged that “callouts began over the holiday period and have increased,” and that the agency was “closely monitoring the situation.” Union officials say officers can’t afford to work unpaid. A TSA union official told  some employees have found that showing up for work was actually hurting them financially, when factoring in costs such as child care and commuting. Some skipped work to seek temporary jobs to help make ends meet. Two federal officials who spoke with  on Friday said officers were calling out sick in protest of the expectation that they work without paychecks until the Trump administration and Congress make a deal to end the shutdown. Approximately 51,000 TSA officers are among the 800,000 government employees who are either working unpaid or on furlough and are set to miss their first full paychecks this week. ’s Dave Alsup and Madeline Holcombe contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Bernie Sanders raised nearly $6 million in the 24 hours following his 2020 presidential campaign launch, his campaign said Wednesday, a record-smashing debut that easily outstripped his Democratic rivals. Sanders raised $5,925,771 from 223,047 individual contributors across all 50 states in the campaign’s first 24 hours, and more than $6 million from 225,000 individuals in total since the launch. And Sanders’ campaign also noted that the average contribution was $27, “mirroring [Sanders’] 2016 campaign’s average donation,” a symbolic reflection of the Vermont senator’s grassroots support that was key to his anti-establishment bid against Hillary Clinton. Sanders haul bests totals publicized by the other Democrats in the race so far. Sen. Kamala Harris had previously set the standard when she raised $1.5 million in the 24 hours following her announcement in late January. Sen. Amy Klobuchar had announced raising $1 million in the first 48 hours after her campaign launch. Other 2020 contenders have yet to release 24-hour fundraising numbers, and a more complete picture of the field’s fundraising strength will come after campaigns file reports with the FEC after the first quarter. However, data from ActBlue suggested Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised about $299,000 on the popular online fundraising platform in the 24 hours following her campaign announcement on New Year’s Eve. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, who announced his White House bid in mid-December, didn’t announce a 24-hour total, but had over two weeks in the year-end FEC reporting period to raise funds, and his presidential committee reported raising about $220,000 over that span. Bernie Sanders launches second presidential campaign with big fundraising haul In announcing its fundraising haul, the Sanders campaign also said that “individuals contributed $600,000 in donations that will recur every month” – a huge, dependable grassroots donor base that will afford the campaign a consistent budgeting baseline. “The only way we will win this election and create a government and economy that work for all is with a grassroots movement – the likes of which has never been seen in American history,” Sanders said in his message announcing his campaign. “They may have the money and power. We have the people.” Sanders also enters the race with more than $9 million left in his US Senate campaign committee – funds that he can transfer to his presidential campaign. That’s more than any other contender besides Warren ($11 million) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ($10.3 million) have in their Senate campaign accounts, and coupled with the $6 million he raised since his presidential campaign launch, Sanders begins his 2020 White House bid with a precipitous financial advantage. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Trump picks Mick Mulvaney to head consumer agency Hours earlier, the outgoing director had picked his own successor President Donald Trump named an interim head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau shortly after the outgoing director appointed his own successor, signaling a potential showdown over who’s in charge of the federal watchdog agency. Trump named Mick Mulvaney, the current director of the Office of Management and Budget, as interim director of the consumer agency. “Director Mulvaney will serve as acting director until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed,” the White House said in a statement Friday. But hours before, the consumer agency’s outgoing director, Richard Cordray, had sent a letter to Trump, declaring he was officially done leading the agency once the clock struck midnight. Cordray named his chief of staff, Leandra English, as deputy director, which essentially establishes her as the bureau’s acting director. The departure of Cordray, the first-ever director of the consumer agency and an appointee of President Barack Obama, marks an opening for Trump to overhaul the agency’s leadership. The two appointments sparked confusion on who will be in charge when employees return to work Monday. The White House on Saturday defended the President’s authority to appoint Mulvaney, calling it a “typical, routine move.” “We think that this move is clearly supported by a plain reading of the Vacancies’ Act,” a senior administration official said on a call with reporters, referring to the presidential appointment authorities outlined in the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. “The Vacancy Act is a long-established, used by presidents of both parties as a routine function, and we believe this act is consistent with that long-established practice.” But in a tweet Friday night, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, an architect of the consumer agency, said that under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the agency’s deputy director assumes the role of acting director if there’s a vacancy. The Dodd-Frank Act is clear: if there is a @CFPB Director vacancy, the Deputy Director becomes Acting Director. @realDonaldTrump can’t override that. pic.twitter.com/r949ccaJAb Trump “can’t override that,” she tweeted. The President “can nominate the next director – but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act,” Warren tweeted. In more fine print, the administration can appoint a current government official into a new job as long as they are confirmed by the Senate under the Federal Vacancies Act to serve in an acting capacity. The official is not required to leave their current position to fill the new role until a permanent replacement is confirmed by the Senate. Mulvaney said he will continue to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget in addition to the new role. Like many Republicans, Mulvaney has been a major critic of the consumer watchdog agency. While serving in Congress, he voted in favor of killing the agency, which was created after the financial crisis to protect consumers and keep an eye on Wall Street. Mulvaney and other opponents have argued that the consumer agency has too much power, saying it installs unduly harsh regulations. He has worked alongside Trump to roll back some of the consumer agency’s rules. Trump signed legislation this month repealing a rule issued by the CFPB that made it easier for consumers to team up to sue banks and credit card companies. Some Republicans had called for Cordray’s firing, saying his regulatory authority has lacked oversight during his tenure at the consumer agency. In his exit letter, Cordray said the consumer agency’s work is vital to the US economy. Proponents of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau say it plays a key role in preventing big business from preying on the little guy. “We have returned almost $12 billion to more than 30 million consumers who had been cheated or mistreated by banks or other large financial companies,” Cordray wrote in the letter. Obama angered Republicans when he installed Cordray in 2012 while the Senate was in recess, but the Senate confirmed him for a full five-year term in 2013. Republicans have tried to replace the director with a committee and seek ways to make it easier to challenge the bureau’s rules. Other independent agencies are usually led by commissioners or board members. Democrats are lining up to scrutinize any future Trump nominee. “The White House has said it wants to stand up for the middle class. If that’s true, the President must nominate a successor who will put working people ahead of Wall Street,” Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said this month. ’s Donna Borak, Jeremy Diamond, Julia Horowitz and Miranda Green contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

Hillary Clinton stopped at a union rally outside Donald Trump’s hotel on the Strip here, taunting the Republican front-runner on the eve of the first Democratic presidential debate. “Some people think Trump is entertaining, but it is not entertaining to insult immigrants and women,” Clinton said. Clinton joined about 500 members of the Culinary Workers Union – a powerhouse in Nevada, with 55,000 members. The group is lobbying to organize the Trump International Hotel here. “If you are going to run for president, then represent all of the people of the United States,” she said. “I wanted to come by to lend my voice to all yours and I wish you well in these efforts.” She also stressed that workers should have the right to unionize and that, as president, she would protect those rights. Her visit wasn’t announced ahead of time. But it reflects Clinton’s broader Democratic primary strategy: Keeping her attacks focused on Republicans, demonstrating to Democratic voters that she is best equipped to take on the eventual GOP nominee. The stop comes as Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and three other candidates prepare for their first presidential debate, set for 8:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Wynn and hosted by  and Facebook. Sanders did not attend the rally. But a Tesla wrapped in Sanders’ campaign logo drove by just after Clinton left. “We want Bernie,” the driver yelled, eliciting a ton of applause from the union members. Both Hillary and Bill Clinton arrived in Las Vegas on Monday afternoon – though the former president is not expected to attend Tuesday’s debate. Clinton isn’t the first Democratic presidential debate to use Trump’s Las Vegas hotel as a prop. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley held a similar event outside the venue in August. 6 things to watch at the #DemDebate © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

In a brief, two-paragraph letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Russia investigations, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short copied and pasted Trump’s tweet onto formal letterhead. “In response to the Committee’s inquiry, we refer you to President Trump’s June 22, 2017, statement regarding this matter: “With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea whether there are ‘tapes’ or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings,” wrote in the letter on Friday. On May 17, Trump set off a flurry of speculation by sending a tweet that seemingly indicated he might have taped conversations of his conversations with the FBI director, who he later fired, citing the Russia investigation “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Trump tweeted. Leaders of the House and Senate Russia investigations had asked Trump to produce the tapes, if they existed. The four leaders of the investigations, Reps. Michael Conaway and Adam Schiff and Sens. Richard Burr and Mark Warner, were not immediately available for comment Friday evening. However, Schiff said Thursday that Trump’s tweet alone would not be enough, and that he had more questions, including whether the President was trying to threaten Comey with his May 17 tweet. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is ready to strike. The Democratic presidential candidate, who has been drawing thousands of supporters at rallies in early-voting states, is striking with contract workers Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol, in the fight to increase the minimum wage. He was joined by progressive caucus Democrats Rep. Keith Ellison and Rep. Raul Grijalva. “It is a national disgrace that millions of full-time workers are living in poverty and millions more are forced to work two or three jobs just to pay their bills,” Sanders said at the outdoor rally near the Capitol. “In the year 2015, a job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised to a living wage.” Sanders and the Congressional Progressive Caucus will introduce legislation that calls on Congress to enact a $15 an hour national minimum wage, as well as calling on President Barack Obama to issue an executive order that would reward companies with federal contracts if they agree to pay their workers $15 an hour, as well as allow them to unionize. The minimum wage – and the fight over wages in general – has been a huge rallying point among liberals as Democrats have embraced the fight over income inequality. Obama signed an executive order in February 2014 to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10.10. But Sanders, the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist, and progressive members of Congress say that it’s not enough. “When I’m on picket lines around the country, people tell me they’re protesting because they’re working harder than ever and still can’t make ends meet,” Rep. Ellison tells  in a statement. “The Progressive Caucus stands in solidarity with the working Americans putting in longer hours and seeing smaller paychecks. In the richest nation in the world, no business should be able to pay so little their workers are forced to find second and third jobs to feed their kids.” Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley released a statement last week, highlighting his endorsement of a $15 minimum wage increase and Hillary Clinton’s declination to support the legislation. “I strongly support the national movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, because it will lift millions of families out of poverty and create better customers for American businesses,” O’Malley said. “Some people will say this is hard to do. And it will be. But leadership is about forging public consensus — not following it.” Clinton did not commit to supporting a $15 minimum wage increase and told Buzzfeed News Thursday that “there are different economic environments. And what you can do in L.A. or in New York may not work in other places.” Critics say that a $15 minimum wage increase will be disastrous for businesses, and in turn, for workers. The Employment Policies Institute released an ad Wednesday slamming the legislation. “This legislation is going to hurt employees is because it’s completely unrealistic,” Michael Saltsman, EPI’s Research Director, told  in a phone interview Wednesday. “Customers are price sensitive and going to a $15 min wage is going to trigger businesses to take steps to off set higher costs.” Saltsman says that, as Sanders makes youth unemployment a key cornerstone to his presidential run, he “would say to him that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is worst thing because that’s going to kick more [youth] out of a job.” With Congress under Republican control, there’s little appetite to take up a legislative action to change the minimum wage, so at the national level there’s not much that can be done beyond executive actions. However, at the state level, blue states and some cities have taken up the mantel of raising the wage on their own. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

        "articles": "Laura Stepp: Conservatives are choosing to ignore science Stepp: Some myths: Contraception causes abortion and prostate cancer They reject scientific contradictions of their religious teachings, she says Stepp: Opposition to birth control is a losing battle as new generation grows up Editor’s Note: Laura Sessions Stepp is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, formerly with The Washington Post, who specializes in the coverage of young people. She has written two books: “Unhooked: How Young Women Pursue Sex, Delay Love and Lose at Both” and “Our Last Best Shot: Guiding Our Children through Early Adolescence.” She is a consultant to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. How can it be that we are firmly into the 21st century and reading claims that birth control pills can cause prostate cancer and abort babies? Or, my personal favorite, that a woman can be considered pregnant before her egg unites with a sperm? Such falsehoods are being touted not by yahoos but by educated conservatives who, in growing numbers, choose to ignore what science tells them. According to a paper in a recent American Sociological Review, conservatives with at least a bachelor’s degree have, over the last several decades, lost their faith in science to an amazing degree. Although the paper doesn’t cite advances in contraception specifically, they are clearly one victim of this disaffection. Our country’s top health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, counts contraception as one of the 10 greatest health achievements of the 20th century. Yet recently: – A state legislator from New Hampshire, opposed to insurance companies being required to pay for birth control, called attention to a report suggesting that birth control pills cause prostate cancer. (Certain drugs in those pills become waste and eventually pass into the environment, according to the report, exposing men to carcinogens.) The representative based her statement on findings that originally appeared in the British Medical Journal, findings that one author of the study later characterized as only a hypothesis, and were seriously questioned in a subsequent BMJ article. Brown: I believe in women's rights Obama calls contraception advocate – Some members of Congress, in their attempt to derail legislation requiring insurers, including the insurers of some religious organizations, to cover birth control, falsely argued that Plan B, the “morning after” pill taken after sex in order to avoid pregnancy, causes abortions. Follow @Opinion on Twitter and Facebook.com/opinion It does not, nor do other methods of contraception, James N. Martin, Jr., president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, pointed out in a letter to the editor in USA Today. “The definition of contraception is to prevent pregnancy, which occurs at implantation,” he wrote. The morning-after pill is often confused with another drug, RU-486, which, he said, does induce abortion and is therefore not considered contraception. – Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law a bill prohibiting abortions that occur 20 weeks after a woman’s last period begins. (This is in contrast to starting the 20-week count about two weeks later, when fertilization likely occurs.) As Amanda Marcotte notes in RH Reality Check, Arizona conservatives, in effect, said that women could be pregnant before egg and sperm unite. Apparently they were dozing off during ninth-grade biology. Not all political conservatives are Flat Earthers, of course. But there are proportionately more of them than there used to be, according to the Review article.For that piece, Gordon Gauchat, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, analyzed information from the General Social Survey, conducted every year since 1972 by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. He found that in 1974, the year Republican Gerald Ford became president, 48% of conservatives trusted science, a higher proportion, interestingly, than found among liberals or moderates. By 2010, however, that number had fallen to 34%, while the degree of trust among moderates and liberals remained stable. Of particular note: Confidence dropped among conservatives who held bachelor’s degrees, not those who only finished high school. Gauchat theorized that because educated conservatives are more politically engaged than other voting blocs, they are more likely to seek information that conforms to their ideology. As the Los Angeles Times, writing about Gauchat’s work, pointed out, some of them have big money to spend spreading their ideas. “Right-wing think tanks, funded by corporate interests to undermine the scientific consensus on such expensive-to-fix phenomena as climate change, have proliferated, as have conservative cable-TV networks, blogs and radio talk shows,” the Times noted. “These outlets are talking to a well-educated audience. And they’re presenting a very one-sided view of scientific issues.” Gauchat also wrote about the influence of the religious right, “which rejects scientific contradictions of religious teachings on such issues as evolution and stem-cell research, and the growing use of science to inform public policy in such areas as environmental protection.” “Conservatives, ever wary of government interference with the free market, started to resent the scientists. … Rather than debate remedies, they have turned on science itself. … (They) really have their own subculture, complete with ontological claims about what the world is about.” Here’s what the world is really about when it comes to using birth control: Women, notably millennials, the largest generation ever, are pursuing higher education, jobs and careers, having sex and bearing children, all according to a timetable that works best for them, their partners and their babies. They couldn’t do this if birth control wasn’t accessible, affordable and safe. Demonizing it amounts to telling these women to throw out their briefcases and take up their vacuum cleaners. Conservative opposition to contraception has a last-gasp ring to it, and most Americans know that. One indication is a poll recently published by the Public Religion Research Institute, a think tank supported by a broad spectrum of scientists and religious experts. The poll showed a majority of Americans, including a majority of Catholics, believe that most employers should be required to provide their employees with health care plans that cover contraception at no cost. Another sign of change is the perceptible ease with which young men talk about and support contraception, including methods being developed for them. Nick Halzack, a 23-year-old policy intern working in Washington, says he looks forward to the day when male birth control, in various testing stages around the country, goes on the market. “My generation has always had contraception,” he says. “It was a part of our sex education and is a part of our relationships. We are just beginning to get engaged in the politics, and the fight against it is a losing battle.” The opinions used in this commentary are solely those of Laura Sessions Stepp. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "NEW: Father of gay Scout denied Eagle rank says BSA move \"step in the right direction\" Decision on whether to pass issue to local level could come in February Currently, Boy Scout national policy does not allow gay members or leaders Anti-gay policy sparked protest, prompting many Eagle Scouts to renounce their awards The Boy Scouts of America is considering changing its longstanding policy against allowing openly gay members, according to a news release from the organization. The organization, which has 2.7 million members, is “potentially discussing” doing away with its national policy after months of protest, including hundreds of angry Eagle Scouts renouncing their hard-earned awards and mailing back their red-white-and-blue medals. Many parents of Scouts across America found the national policy excluding gays confusing – and at odds with basic scouting ideals. Social media were abuzz with outrage over the policy; gay men who used to be Scouts spoke out in first-person blogs. On her TV talk show, Ellen DeGeneres featured a California Scout who had been denied his Eagle rank because he is gay. Outcry against Boy Scouts policy Gay teen stripped of Eagle Scout honors Boy Scouts dismiss gay den mother Members of the organization’s national board are expected to bring up the issue at a regularly scheduled biannual meeting in February. Any change would be announced after that. Scouting goes through a rough patch In the Scouts’ statement Monday, the group indicated that the national board may consider passing any decisions on gay membership to the local level. Each troop’s charter organization would be able to decide “consistent with each organization’s mission, principles, or religious beliefs.” “The policy change under discussion would allow the religious, civic, or educational organizations that oversee and deliver Scouting to determine how to address this issue,” the statement said. The statement itself is remarkable. Some members will see the fact that Scouting’s national leadership is even discussing a policy change as a softening of its stance on gays and lesbians. But some Scouts and Scout parents say that passing the decision to the local level will have little effect on the ground, because many troops have been ignoring the national policy anyway. The announcement comes after Scouting’s national headquarters received numerous complaints from a grass-roots campaign targeting the policy. In April, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation started calls for the Scouts to end the ban. The group applauded Monday’s announcement. “The Boy Scouts of America have heard from scouts, corporations and millions of Americans that discriminating against gay Scouts and Scout leaders is wrong,” GLAAD President Herndon Graddick said. “Scouting is a valuable institution, and this change will only strengthen its core principles of fairness and respect.” Opinion: Boy Scouts, time to end discrimination The protest was sparked last year after Ohio Cub Scout den leader Jennifer Tyrrell was forced to step down from her position in her son’s Cub Scout pack because she is openly gay. The father of a gay California Boy Scout whose application for Eagle rank was rejected by a Scout council hailed the BSA statement as “a step in the right direction.” “It’s interesting that the BSA is leaking this beforehand,” said Eric Andresen, whose son Ryan was denied the Eagle rank after being a Scout for more than a decade. “We feel if they are going out with this much publicity they couldn’t possibly say no now,” said the elder Andresen, adding that his son sees the move also as “a step in the right direction … It’s about time.” Meanwhile, conservative Family Research Council President Tony Perkins released a statement in response to Monday’s announcement saying the Scouts organization “would be making a serious mistake to bow to the strong-arm tactics of LGBT activists and open the organization to homosexuality.” Perkins added: “What has changed in terms of the Boy Scouts’ concern for the well-being of the boys under their care? Or is this not about the well-being of the Scouts, but the funding for the organization?” Some critics who say that Scouts have failed to change with the times blame the connections to organized religion. Approximately 70% of Scout troops are affiliated with some kind of church or religious group, according to Boy Scouts of America spokesman Deron Smith. Scouts for Equality reports that 11 organization councils, which include more than 260,000 Scouts, have publicly protested the policy, according to GLAAD. The Catholic Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are among scouting’s biggest backers, Boy Scouts of America says. In 2011, Mormon-backed Cub Scout and Boy Scout troops accounted for more than 420,000 of all Scouts nationwide. More than 200,000 Scouts were members of units affiliated with the Catholic Church. President Barack Obama – the honorary head of the Scouts, as is every president – supports gay and lesbians in Girl and Boy Scouts, as does former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a Mormon. Last year, the Girl Scouts allowed a transgender member into a troop, sparking a cookie boycott.

        "articles": "Diplomatic cables sent from the United Kingdom’s ambassador to the United States back to London describe President Donald Trump as “inept,” “insecure” and “incompetent,” a UK government official confirmed Saturday to . The leak could cause serious diplomatic damage between the two “special relationship” allies. While foreign envoys of all nations are often candid in classified dispatches back home, there are periodic episodes when such assessments leak, causing great political embarrassment. Months of efforts by the ambassador, Kim Darroch and his diplomats to build ties and trust with Trump and his political acolytes will be undermined. On Monday, Trump said that the White House would no longer “deal with” Darroch. The cables were leaked to and first published by the Daily Mail. The UK's next prime minister will be chosen by 0.2% of the nation Darroch used secret cables and briefing notes to warn the UK government that Trump’s “career could end in disgrace,” and described conflicts within the White House as “knife fights,” according to the Daily Mail. A UK government source told  the memos described in the Daily Mail story are genuine. The Daily Mail says the memos span the period between 2017 to present day, covering everything from Trump’s foreign policy to his 2020 reelection plans. In one memo dated June 22, according to the Daily Mail, Darroch questioned Trump’s claim that he pulled back from retaliating against Iran last month after the downing of a US drone because the President was told at the last minute that US air strikes could kill 150 Iranians. He also said in a cable to the Foreign Commonwealth Office that while he believed Trump can’t afford to lose much support, he thinks there’s still a “credible path” for his reelection. The White House told  it had no comment on the story. The UK might be living through its own post-truth Trump moment The leaked cables come at a sensitive time in UK politics with Conservative Party members currently electing a new prime minister to succeed Theresa May, who was effectively toppled by her own members of Parliament for failing to deliver on her country’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union. “The British public would expect our Ambassadors to provide Ministers with an honest, unvarnished assessment of the politics in their country. Their views are not necessarily the views of Ministers or indeed the government. But we pay them to be candid. Just as the US Ambassador here will send back his reading of Westminster politics and personalities,” a statement from the British FCO said. “Of course we would expect such advice to be handled by Ministers and civil servants in the right way and it’s important that our Ambassadors can offer their advice and for it remain confidential. Our team in Washington have strong relations with the White House and no doubt that these will withstand such mischievous behaviour,” the statement continued. The favorite for the job, Boris Johnson, is seen as likely to seek to forge a much closer relationship to Trump than May, who made strenuous efforts to court the President and developed a respectful relationship but never really bonded with him politically. If it leaves the EU, Britain will be seeking to seal a bilateral trade deal with the US and Trump is expected to drive a hard bargain. So there will be speculation that the leak of Darroch’s memos was a politically motivated act by someone in London to clear space in Washington for an outspokenly pro-Brexit ambassador. Darroch also used to work as national security adviser to former British Prime Minister David Cameron and as a top UK representative to the EU, so although he’s a career diplomat, he is not seen as philosophically aligned with the crowd of hardcore Brexiteers expected to take over 10 Downing Street. Boris Johnson is in denial about the reality of Brexit Johnson is unpredictable, politically incorrect, a populist and deeply critical of the EU and is often accused of blurring facts – traits which he shares with Trump. There is so far no reaction from the President’s Twitter feed. But Trump has never felt constrained from criticizing the British government. Several times, he has embarrassed May after criticizing her handling of Brexit negotiations. He plunged into Britain’s internal affairs in June by openly rooting for various Conservative candidates in the leadership elections. And he has waged a long-running feud with London’s mayor Sadiq Khan. Trump also raised some eyebrows in the UK by repeatedly praising Nigel Farage, one of the most prominent campaigners for Brexit. Trump has in the past suggested Farage, whom he called “a friend of mine,” should become the UK ambassador to the US. That idea was quickly ruled out by Downing Street. Farage rushed to Trump’s defense on Sunday, tweeting: “Kim Darroch is totally unsuitable for the job and the sooner he is gone the better.” Darroch had been riding high on the success of Trump’s trip to the UK in June which largely went off without a hitch. His position with the Trump administration however now looks difficult at best. Though his memos are deeply sensitive given the source, the unflattering depiction of the Trump White House is one that will be recognizable to readers of US media outlets.

        "articles": "Donald Trump called Monday to block all Muslims from entering the United States Trump has previously called for surveillance against mosques Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump called Monday for barring all Muslims from entering the United States. “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on,” a campaign press release said. Trump, who has previously called for surveillance against mosques and said he was open to establishing a database for all Muslims living in the U.S., made his latest controversial call in a news release. His message comes in the wake of a deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by suspected ISIS sympathizers and the day after President Barack Obama asked the country not to “turn against one another” out of fear. Trump’s comments are likely to roil the Republican presidential race, forcing many of his opponents for the nomination to engage in a debate over whether there should be a religious test to enter America. But his proposal was met with enthusiasm by many of his supporters, who showed their approval via social media as well as at his rally on Monday night. RELATED: Trump to critics of Muslim travel ban: I don’t care “I think that we should definitely disallow any Muslims from coming in. Any of them. The reason is simple: we can’t identify what their attitude is,” said 75-year-old Charlie Marzka of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Moreover, the Muslim travel ban will likely do little to dent Trump’s own popularity among Republican primary voters. The billionaire businessman has dominated the GOP contest for months despite repeated controversies that would likely sink other White House hopefuls. “Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine,” Trump said in a statement. “Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.” Trump’s campaign added in the release that such a ban should remain in effect “until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” The release pointed to an online poll from the controversial Center for Security Policy, which claimed that a quarter of Muslims living in the U.S. believe violence against Americans is justified as part of a global jihadist campaign. Critics have questioned the reliability of the organization’s information. It also pointed to a Pew Research poll, which the campaign declined to identify, which the campaign claimed points to “great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.” Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told  on Monday that the ban would apply not just to Muslim foreigners looking to immigrate to the U.S., but also to Muslims looking to visit the U.S. as tourists. “Everyone,” Lewandowski said when asked if the ban would also apply to Muslim tourists. “Great surveillance and vigilance must be adhered to,” said Trump in an additional statement Lewandowski provided to . “We want to be very fair but too many bad things are happening and the percentage of true hatred is too great. People that are looking to destroy our country must be reported and turned in by the good people who love our country and want America to be great again.” Trump confirmed that his policy would not apply to current Muslims in the U.S. during a Fox News interview on Monday evening. “I have Muslim friends, Greta, and they’re wonderful people. But there’s a tremendous section and cross-section of Muslims living in our country who have tremendous animosity,” he told Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren. “It does not apply to people living in the country, except we have to be vigilant.” Obama’s deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes reacted to Trump’s call Monday on , calling it “totally contrary to our values as Americans” and pointed to the Bill of Rights’ protection of freedom of religion and pointing to the “extraordinary contributions” Muslim Americans have made to the U.S. “But it’s also contrary to our security,” Rhodes told ’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.” “The fact of the matter is ISIL wants to frame this as a war between the United States and Islam, and if we look like we’re applying religious tests to who comes into this country, we’re sending a message that essentially we’re embracing that frame and that is going to make it very difficult to partner with Muslim communities here in the United States and around the world to prevent the scourge of radicalization that we should be focused on.” “We should make it harder for ISIL to portray this as a war between the United States and Islam, not easier,” Rhodes added, using another acronym for ISIS, the radical Islamist group that controls swaths of Syria and Iraq and has called for terror attacks against the U.S. Trump has beat back criticism in recent weeks that he is bigoted against Muslims, even telling  on Saturday when asked whether Muslims pose a danger to the U.S. that he thinks Muslims “are great people.” “I love the Muslims. I think they’re great people,” Trump told  in September. And when he became tied to the idea of creating a database of all Muslims living in the U.S., Trump sought to distance himself from that proposal – insisting that the idea was a reporter’s and he was not committed to it. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, speaking to members of the Muslim community earlier in the afternoon, echoed the President’s sentiment on Sunday warning against divisiveness. “Bitterness grows out of hopelessness, and there is no hopelessness in this situation, however uncomfortable and menacing it may be at times,” he said. “Faith in the ultimate strength of the democratic philosophy and code of the Nation as a whole has always been stronger than the impulse to despair” It didn’t take long for the rest of the Republican presidential primary field to repudiate Trump’s call. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie slammed Trump’s proposal in a radio interview. “This is the kind of thing that people say when they have no experience and don’t know what they are talking about. We do not need to resort to that type of activity nor should we,” Christie said on the Michael Medved radio show. “What we need to do is to increase our intelligence activities. We need to cooperate with peaceful Muslim Americans who want to give us intelligence against those who are radicalized.” And South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham called on every presidential candidate to “do the right thing & condemn @Realdonaldtrump’s statement.” Graham later told  that Trump’s rhetoric “is putting our troops serving abroad and our diplomats at risk.” “For interpreters and others risking their lives abroad to help America – this is a death sentence,” Graham said. Graham just returned from a trip to visit troops in the Middle East and said from troops and allies there expressed concerns over Trump’s rhetoric. Graham said he assured them that Trump is in the minority, but Graham said Monday Trump’s latest proposal makes it harder to convince them of that. Every candidate for president needs to do the right thing & condemn @Realdonaldtrump's statement. Another GOP presidential contender, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, said, “‎That is not my policy.” “I have introduced legislation in the Senate that would put in place a three year moratorium on refugees coming from countries where ISIS or al Qaeda control a substantial amount of territory. And the reason is that is where the threat is coming from,” Cruz said as he was leaving a South Carolina field office. In a statement, Ohio Gov. John Kasich said, “This is just more of the outrageous divisiveness that characterizes his every breath and another reason why he is entirely unsuited to lead the United States.” And former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweeted that Trump is “unhinged.” “Donald Trump is unhinged. His “policy” proposals are not serious,” he said. Donald Trump is unhinged. His \"policy\" proposals are not serious. Former neurosurgeon Ben Carson also said is opposed to placing a religious test on U.S. visitors. “Everyone visiting our country should register and be monitored during their stay as is done in many countries. I do not and would not advocate being selective on one’s religion,” he said in a statement. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul’s campaign did not explicitly refute Trump’s proposal. “Sen. Rand Paul has led on the issue of border security, proposing real solutions. That’s why earlier this month he introduced legislation to block visitors and immigrants from nations with known radical elements while a new system is developed to screen properly,” said Sergio Gor, Paul’s communications director, in a statement. Former tech CEO Carly Fiorina said Trump’s “overreaction” is as bad as Obama’s “under reaction.” “President Obama isn’t prepared to do anything, which is clearly foolish, but Donald Trump always plays on everyone’s worst instincts and fears. And saying we’re not going to let a single Muslim into this country is a dangerous overreaction,” she said during a gaggle with reporters in Waterloo, Iowa. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said he disagrees with Trump. “(Trump’s) habit of making offensive and outlandish statements will not bring Americans together. The next president better be somebody who can unite our country to face the great challenges of the 21st Century,” he said in a statement. Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore tweeted, “Trump’s fascist talk drives all minorities from GOP.” Trump's fascist talk drives all minorities from GOP. And former Vice President Dick Cheney, speaking with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, said such a policy goes against the spirit of America. “This whole notion that somehow we can just say no more Muslims, just ban a whole religion, goes against everything we stand for and believe in,” he said. “I mean, religious freedom has been a very important part of our history and where we came from.” Democrats were quick to condemn Trump’s call, with two of the three Democratic presidential candidates calling Trump a “demagogue.” “.@realdonaldtrump removes all doubt: he is running for President as a fascist demagogue,” tweeted Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont also slammed Trump as a demagogue and suggested Trump’s rhetoric would make the U.S. weaker. “Demagogues throughout our history have attempted to divide us based on race, gender, sexual orientation or country of origin. Now, Trump and others want us to hate all Muslims. The United States is a great nation when we stand together. We are a weak nation when we allow racism and xenophobia to divide us,” Sanders said in a statement. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, in a signed message, tweeted, “This is reprehensible, prejudiced and divisive. @RealDonaldTrump, you don’t get it. This makes us less safe. -H” This is reprehensible, prejudiced and divisive. @RealDonaldTrump, you don't get it. This makes us less safe. -H  And the Democratic National Committee sought to align the GOP as a whole alongside Trump. “Donald Trump is indeed a ‘net positive’ for the Republican Party – as their chairman called him – because he shows America what the Republican Party really stands for with his rhetoric that only helps enemies like ISIL/Daesh to recruit extremists,” said DNC spokeswoman Christina Freundlich. Trump’s call for a shutdown of Muslim immigration in the U.S. came hours before he was set to speak aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown, a World War II era ship parked near Charleston, South Carolina. ’s Eric Bradner, Dana Bash, Tom LoBianco, Sara Murray and Elizabeth Landers contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Two years before the housing market collapsed in 2008, Donald Trump said he hoped it would tank Trump made the remarks in a 2006 Trump University audiobook Two years before the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, Donald Trump said he was hoping for a crash. “I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy,” Trump said in a 2006 audiobook from Trump University, answering a question about “gloomy predictions that the real estate market is heading for a spectacular crash.” The U.S. housing bubble burst two years later, triggering the stock market crash of 2008 that plunged the U.S. economy into a deep recession, leaving millions of Americans unemployed. Trump was speaking with Jon Ward, a marketing consultant who “masterminded all the initial education programs for Trump University,” according to his website. The audiobook is available on iTunes. “If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money,” Trump said in the 2006 audio book, “How to Build a Fortune.” “If you’re in a good cash position – which I’m in a good cash position today – then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.” The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Few, including Trump, predicted the 2008 crash or the magnitude of the recession that would ensue. “I’m not a believer that the interest market – that the real estate market is going to take a big hit,” Trump said in the same interview. But Trump’s comments in the audio book, a project of his Trump University – which is currently facing three lawsuits representing thousands of former students – underscore the challenges the billionaire and presumptive Republican nominee will increasingly face in the general election as comments from his life before politics return to haunt him. Trump has come under fire for a slew of remarks he made before entering the presidential fray last year, from misogynistic comments about women to statements on certain issues that undercut his current policy positions. But in beating back such criticism, Trump has sought to convince voters that, despite his multiple flirtations with running for president over the last two decades, he never planned to run for president, “Don’t forget, I was never going to run for office,” he has said. Trump, who has staked his candidacy on his wealth and business acumen, has also been unabashed about prioritizing his business interests above all else – even when it has involved helping politicians with policy positions antithetical to his own. He defended his hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to Democrats by saying that he “got along with everybody” in order to boost his business. Trump has also defended the bankruptcies several of his businesses have undergone, saying he has “taken advantage of the laws of this country,” even as thousands of his employees lost their jobs as a result. And he has also defended manufacturing much of his merchandise abroad, including in countries like China. But as he launched his presidential bid last June, Trump flipped the script and struck a decisively populist tone –pledging take on very same self-interested maneuvers of businesses that he also employed – and vowed to compel U.S. businesses to manufacture in the U.S. and slammed the influence of special interests in Washington. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "The \"Let Girls Learn\" program was launched by Michelle Obama A Trump administration memo says it is discontinuing it The Trump administration is discontinuing a signature girls education initiative championed by former first lady Michelle Obama, according to officials. The “Let Girls Learn” program, which she and President Barack Obama started in 2015 to facilitate educational opportunities for adolescent girls in developing countries, will cease operation immediately, according to an internal document obtained by . While aspects of the initiative’s programming will continue, employees have been told to stop using the “Let Girls Learn” name and were told that, as a program unto itself, “Let Girls Learn” was ending. “Moving forward, we will not continue to use the ‘Let Girls Learn’ brand or maintain a stand-alone program,” read an email sent to Peace Corps employees this week by the agency’s acting director Sheila Crowley. ” ‘Let Girls Learn’ provided a platform to showcase Peace Corps’ strength in community development, shining a bright light on the work of our Volunteers all over the world,” Crowley wrote. “We are so proud of what ‘Let Girls Learn’ accomplished and we have all of you to thank for this success.” Hours after  reported on an internal document advising administration employees that the education initiative would not be maintained, the White House said the program had not changed. “There have been no changes to the program,” said Kelly Love, a White House spokeswoman, referring to the “Let Girls Learn” initiative, which Obama launched in 2015. Despite memo, White House says Michelle Obama program unchanged The White House originally referred questions about the program to representatives of first lady Melania Trump, who declined to comment. In its comment, the White House did not say whether “Let Girls Learn” would be maintained in the future as a standalone program – and they also did not directly address the memo or why it had been sent. The memo came the same day President Donald Trump’s agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, was visiting an elementary school in suburban Virginia to announce changes to another initiative spotlighted by the former first lady, healthy school lunches. Perdue was set to unveil a rule change “providing regulatory flexibility for the National School Lunch Program” during a visit to Catoctin Elementary School in Leesburg. Like “Let Girls Learn,” improving the nutritional quality of school meals was a major focus of Obama’s during her tenure as first lady. By the numbers: How Trump stacks up after 100 days It wasn’t immediately clear how Perdue’s announcement would alter the nutritional makeup of school lunches nationwide, though health advocacy groups warned that backtracking could prove dangerous for children. “Rather than altering the current path forward, we hope the agency focuses more on providing technical assistance that can help schools get across the finish line, if they haven’t done so already,” said American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown. “Let Girls Learn” was an inter-governmental initiative run primarily at the Peace Corps and the United States Agency for International Development. A spokesman for the Peace Corps said Monday the agency would continue its efforts toward girls’ education. “The Peace Corps continues to prioritize girls’ education and empowerment programming,” the spokesman said. “Girls’ education and empowerment has been a hallmark of our work over the past 56 years and we look forward to continuing those efforts with our interagency partners. We remain dedicated to the passionate work of our volunteers and staff to empower and educate girls in their communities.” Tina Tchen, who served as Obama’s chief of staff during her time in the White House, said the end of “Let Girls Learn” was a disappointment given a global recognition that educating young women could help improve conditions across developing nations. “We felt it was important to have a branded campaign that drew attention to those issues, and we found that when we did it, we had extraordinary support,” Tchen said. “I think it’s unfortunate to not continue with the branded campaign. We think that this is an issue that has bipartisan support, it’s really not a Republican or Democratic issue.” Tchen said the benefits of the program, which drew upon private sector support as well as government dollars, outweighed the costs. She noted that a development program launched by President George W. Bush to combat global HIV/AIDS, PEPFAR, had been maintained and expanded by the Obama administration. Donald Trump’s next 100 days ” ‘Let Girls Learn’ had several years of funding already baked,” she said. “We were hopeful that given that, it could continue. But obviously elections have consequences, and nobody knows that better than we.” After launching the initiative in 2015, Michelle Obama heavily promoted “Let Girls Learn,” including during travel abroad and at events held in Washington.  Films produced a documentary highlighting some of the girls participating in “Let Girls Learn” programs in Morocco and Liberia during the then-first lady’s trip there. Obama also harnessed her popularity on social media to promote “Let Girls Learn,” and enlisted celebrities like Frida Pinto and Meryl Streep to help highlight the struggle girls in many developing countries face in regularly attending school. In October of last year, the Obama administration attempted to reinforce “Let Girls Learn” ahead of a new administration. The White House announced $5 million in private sector commitments toward the programs administered under the “Let Girls Learn” banner, bringing the total financial pledges to more than $1 billion for programs in 50 countries. The hope then was to underscore the success of the initiative in the hopes the next administration would continue it. The memo comes as Melania Trump begins to define her own platform as first lady. While she hasn’t formally announced an official platform, women’s empowerment and access to education for women and girls is emerging as a key area of importance for her growing East Wing. “I continue to firmly believe that education is the most powerful way to promote and ensure women’s rights. Together we will do this not only by striving for gender parity at all levels of education, but also by showing all children, and especially boys, that it is through empathy, respect and kindness that we achieve our collective potential,” she said in a recent speech at the State Department. First daughter Ivanka Trump who serves as an adviser to the President, is focused on women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship, topics she’s touted on panels and in speeches. She is a self-described “Entrepreneur & advocate for the education & empowerment of women & girls,” according to her Twitter biography. In promoting the importance of girls education, Obama regularly highlighted her own educational path, and said it was critical to her success in the private sector and later as first lady. “Education is a very personal thing for me,” she said in October during a discussion at the Newseum with a group of girls from across the globe. “As I tell girls whenever I meet them, I wouldn’t be here, sitting here not just in this chair but in the life that I have, if it weren’t for my education.” Tchen said Monday that the former first lady was still assessing how to promote this issue in her new life as a private citizen. “This is an issue she cares passionately about,” Tchen said. “I think it’s still early days for what she will do in her post-White House life. But this is one she’s looking at figuring out where can she be value added, where can she help with this issue.” ’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.

        "articles": "Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton each lead their party’s respective primary race in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to new polls from Quinnipiac University. But neither Clinton nor Trump fares as well as their top competitors in hypothetical general election match-ups in these three swing states. Home state politicians don’t fare well either – Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Floridians Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush all trail in their respective states. Facing off against each other, Clinton narrowly tops Trump in Florida, 46% to 42%, while she runs about evenly against the other four potential Republican candidates tested. Clinton and Trump run about evenly in Ohio (43% Clinton to 42% Trump) and Pennsylvania (44% Clinton to 42% Trump). But the former secretary of state trails retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson in both states, falls behind Rubio in Ohio and trails both former tech CEO Carly Fiorina and Bush in Pennsylvania. When Trump is matched against either of the other two top Democratic contenders, Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the businessman trails by a significant margin in all three states. But both front-runners still face a long road to their party’s nomination. Florida and Ohio, both currently scheduled to host presidential primaries on March 15, loom larger in the nomination battle than Pennsylvania, where voters will go to the polls in late-April. But if the primary contests on either side remain competitive into the spring, Pennsylvania is one of the biggest prizes slated to vote after March 15. Bill Clinton on Trump: ‘The most interesting character out there’ With support from 28% of Republican registered voters in Florida, Trump tops the GOP field there by 12 points, with Carson in second at 16%. The two candidates who call Florida home follow, with the state’s current senator Rubio at 14% and former governor Bush at 12%. In Ohio, Trump tops Carson 23% to 18%, with Ohio’s governor, John Kasich, in third with 13%. Texas Senator Ted Cruz (11%) and Fiorina (10%) follow. Rubio stands at 7% here, Bush at 4%. In Pennsylvania, Trump has 23% to Carson’s 17%, with Rubio behind at 12%. No other candidate hits double-digits, including Pennsylvania’s Santorum, who has 2% support there. Pennsylvania is kinder to the Democratic candidate with ties to the state, Biden. There, Biden holds 25% and stands second to Clinton’s 36%, with Sanders at 19%. Clinton holds wider leads in Ohio (40% Clinton to 21% Biden and 19% Sanders) and Florida (43% Clinton to 19% each for Biden and Sanders). Without Biden in the race, Clinton holds majority support in all three states when his supporters are re-allocated to their second choice candidate, while Sanders’ backing hovers around 25%. Hillary Clinton: Trump ‘used to think I was great’ Both front-runners, Trump and Clinton, have negative favorability ratings among all registered voters in these three key states, and most in all three say they have doubts about Trump’s and Clinton’s honesty. Carson and Biden are most apt to be seen as honest in trustworthy in all three states. Majorities in each state say Trump and Clinton have strong leadership qualities, the only other candidate viewed that way by majorities in all three states is Biden. Biden also leads all others as an empathetic candidate, with more than 6-in-10 in each state saying he cares about the “needs and problems of people like you.” Clinton, Biden and Bush are most apt to be seen as having the right kind of temperament and personality to handle an international crisis as president, about two-thirds in each state say Trump does not have the right temperament for that. A majority of Ohio voters view Kasich favorably, 52%, but none of the candidates tested are viewed favorably by a majority of voters in all three states. Biden comes closest with 55% seeing him favorably in Florida and 52% in Pennsylvania alongside 47% who view him favorably in Ohio. Biden’s positive ratings in the poll may reflect the fact that he hasn’t been campaigning and hasn’t recently faced the kinds of scrutiny given to the active candidates in the field. Clinton, notably, saw her favorability ratings plummet after her campaign began in earnest this spring. Bill Clinton: Trump is ‘fact-free’ Though there is lots of time remaining before voters in these states will head to the polls, a sizable share say they’ve already started ruling out some candidates. Trump is the top choice in each state as the candidate Republicans say they definitely would not support, with 31% saying they’ve ruled him out in Pennsylvania and 29% each in Ohio and Florida saying they definitely won’t support him. About 1-in-5 in each state say they wouldn’t back Bush, while roughly 1-in-8 in each state say they definitely will not vote for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Among Democrats, 56% in Florida, 50% in Ohio and 47% in Pennsylvania say they haven’t ruled out anyone in the party’s field of potential nominees. The Quinnipiac University polls were conducted by telephone from September 25 through October 5. In Florida, the poll includes interviews with 1,173 registered voters, including 461 Republicans and 411 Democrats. In Ohio, it includes 1,180 registered voters, 433 Republicans and 396 Democrats. And in Pennsylvania, 1,049 registered voters, 427 Republicans and 442 Democrats. The margin of sampling error for results among registered voters is roughly plus or minus 3 percentage points in each state, among Republicans, it is 4.6 points in Florida, 4.7 in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and for Democrats, it is 4.8 points in Florida, 4.9 points in Ohio and 4.7 points in Pennsylvania.

        "articles": "Michael Cohen on Wednesday provided the House Intelligence Committee with new documents showing edits to the false written statement he delivered to Congress in 2017 about the Trump Organization’s pursuit of the Trump Tower Moscow project into the 2016 campaign season, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. The documents Cohen provided are intended to further explain his public testimony last week, in which Cohen said that President Donald Trump’s then-personal lawyer Jay Sekulow made changes to his statement to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, and that it was reviewed ahead of time by lawyers like Abbe Lowell, an attorney for Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the President’s daughter and son-in-law who are both White House advisers. It’s unclear what Cohen’s documents show was specifically changed in the statement. Cohen testified Wednesday behind closed doors at the House Intelligence Committee. “There were changes made, additions – Jay Sekulow, for one,” Cohen said last week. “There were several changes that were made including how we were going to handle that message, which was – the message of course being – the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive.” Sekulow pushed back on Cohen’s allegations in a statement last week, saying that the “testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the President edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false.” As  previously reported, according to two of the sources familiar with the preparation, including one close to the Trump Organization and one close to the President’s legal team, the lawyers had no indication that any of the information in the testimony of Trump’s now-former longtime attorney and fixer was inaccurate. Lanny Davis, Cohen’s attorney, told  that Cohen himself authored the false line in his 2017 testimony to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project timeline. Cohen wrote the initial draft of the testimony himself and then his attorney Stephen Ryan edited it, sharing it with other attorneys who were part of the joint defense agreement, to review for accuracy and potential privilege issues and those attorneys provided some suggested changes, a source familiar with the drafting of Cohen’s testimony said. Cohen and his attorney approved all changes, according to the source. The source said the claim that the Trump Tower Moscow deal was over in January was in the draft from Cohen’s initial writing and remained. That timeline was consistent with documents that had been seen by the attorneys. Cohen pleaded guilty late last year to lying to Congress on three different issues, according to Justice Department court filings: the project’s timeline and his discussions about it with Trump, that Cohen never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project, and that Cohen did not recall any Russian government response. Cohen also accused Trump in his public testimony of encouraging him to lie about the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, though he said Trump did not tell him to do so directly. “He doesn’t tell you what he wants. What he does is again, ‘Michael, there’s no Russia, there’s no collusion, there’s no involvement, there’s no interference.’ I know what he means because I’ve been around him for so long,” Cohen testified. “That’s the message that he wanted to reinforce.” Cohen was supposed to report to prison Wednesday to begin serving a three-year sentence for tax crimes, tax evasion and lying to Congress. Instead, Trump’s former lawyer was on Capitol Hill talking about the crimes he is now accusing Trump of committing. Cohen, who is now slated to begin his prison term on May 6, was back on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a final eight-hour session — his fourth appearance in the last nine days — concluding his closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that began last week. He spent roughly 30 hours in total with three different congressional committees. “It’s been a long day, it’s been a long couple of days but again I believe they are happy,” Cohen said as he left the committee’s spaces. “I have given them my assurance that any additional information that they need I’m here to cooperate and will continue to cooperate.” House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff wouldn’t discuss Cohen’s testimony, but acknowledged the panel had received new documents and said they expected further cooperation from Cohen. “Mr. Cohen cooperated fully with the Committee, answered every question we asked of him during both interview sessions, and provided important testimony and materials relevant to the core of our probe and that will allow us to advance our investigation substantially,” Schiff said. “We look forward to his continued cooperation with Congress and law enforcement.” In the first round of testimony last week, Cohen was asked about a range of topics, with lawmakers seeking additional details on the drafting of Cohen’s statement as well as any discussions about a possible pardon. The session also included some of the partisan fighting that plagued the committee during its Russia investigation in the last Congress, according to sources familiar with his testimony. Republicans on the committee objected to what they felt were untoward Democratic tactics in the run-up to the interview, noting that Democratic committee staff met with Cohen several times before the hearing without telling the Republicans, according to the sources. They also asked Cohen about his comments in last week’s public hearing that he had discussed “topics” with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff before the hearing, the sources said. Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, sent Cohen’s attorney a letter on Thursday asking for details about his contact with Schiff and his committee staff, suggesting the staff may have “coached” Cohen. Patrick Boland, a spokesman for Schiff, said that the committee was running “a professional investigation in search of the facts, and we welcome the opportunity to meet with potential witnesses in advance of any testimony to determine relevant topics to cover in order to make productive use of their time before the committee.” “Despite this professed outrage by Republicans, it’s completely appropriate to conduct proffer sessions and allow witnesses to review their prior testimony before the Committee interviews them — such sessions are a routine part of every serious investigation around the country, including congressional investigations,” Boland said. Consultation with witnesses ahead of a hearing or interview isn’t necessarily out of the ordinary. For instance, Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, also spoke to Republicans on the House Oversight Committee ahead of their hearing last week. But the questions about Schiff’s consultation from Intelligence Committee Republicans underscores the divisions between the two parties on that panel when it comes to the Russia investigation. Cohen’s final day of Capitol Hill testimony, notably, comes in an even more heated environment than last week, after House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler announced Monday the start of a sweeping investigation into the President. House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings signaled after Cohen’s public testimony that he wanted to interview Trump’s eldest son Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, among others. And the House Intelligence Committee has signaled interest in Weisselberg, while Schiff said the committee would hold a public hearing next week with Felix Sater, the Russian-born Trump business associate who worked with Cohen on the Trump Tower Moscow project. Trump has aggressively pushed back on the House investigations following Cohen’s testimony, charging that “the witch hunt continues” and Democrats have effectively “started the campaign.” House Oversight to pursue interviews with Trump family members, close associates “The witch hunt continues. The fact is that – I guess we got 81 letters. There was no collusion. It’s a hoax,” Trump told reporters Tuesday when asked about the investigations. In his public testimony last week, Cohen accused Trump of directing him to make hush-money payments to women alleging affairs, and then displayed a reimbursement check he was paid with Trump’s signature. He also accused Trump of telling him to publicly lie about Trump’s knowledge of the payments in February 2018, along with committing financial fraud. He followed up that public House Oversight appearance with the first part of his closed-door House Intelligence interview the following day, where Schiff said the committee was able to “drill down” certain issues in even more detail. “We are in communication with, obviously, Mr. Cohen and his counsel about further document requests following our interview today that we’ll be able to discuss at our next session,” Schiff said after Cohen had finished for the day. “We also went through documents in our possession, dozens of documents in our possession with Mr. Cohen, but we have additional document requests that we will be in discussion with him about.” There are a host of topics that lawmakers are interested in hearing from Cohen about, including his public testimony about overhearing a conversation between Trump and longtime confidante Roger Stone involving a WikiLeaks’ email dump, presidential pardons, and Cohen’s public testimony that the Southern District of New York could be investigating his conversations with Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Cohen’s former lawyer, Stephen Ryan, discussed the possibility of a pardon for Cohen with Trump’s attorneys after the FBI’s raid on Cohen. The House Judiciary Committee is also asking questions about pardons, as they asked a number of Trump officials related to possible pardons for Cohen, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.

The letter from press secretary Stephanie Grisham cited his conduct at President Trump’s event with social media allies on July 11, when Karem had a heated exchange with pro-Trump radio host Sebastian Gorka. Grisham intended to keep the letter private, according to a source, but Karem chose to make it public in a tweet on Friday. “I can and will appeal this decision,” Karem wrote.

On Friday evening Playboy and Karem retained First Amendment attorney Ted Boutrous, who successfully represented  and Jim Acosta last November. The White House revoked Acosta’s “hard pass,” a badge that speeds up entry to the White House complex, after Acosta questioned Trump at a post-midterms press conference. The pass was revoked without any warning shortly before Acosta was due back at the White House for a live shot on . The network filed suit a few days later. A federal judge sided with the network and Acosta and issued a temporary restraining order, thereby forcing the White House to restore his press pass for 14 days. The administration then backed down and restored Acosta’s access. But Trump said the White House would “create rules and regulations for conduct” so that the administration could revoke press passes in the future. In the Karem case, Grisham appears to be following a process that was laid out last fall after the Acosta court fight. Grisham’s letter to Karem said that the suspension is a “preliminary decision,” according to a source. Karem has until Monday to submit a response. Then Grisham will make a final determination. This process establishes a paper trail and possibly some sort of due process, which was at issue in the Acosta case. When contacted by  on Friday evening, Grisham declined to comment on the action against Karem. Karem is a highly controversial figure on the White House beat. He writes opinionated columns for Playboy, hosts a podcast and appears on  as a political analyst. Some White House reporters privately grumble that he strays way too far into advocacy territory. But he has won fans and an ardent social media following, especially on the left, for the same reason. Karem is a fixture at the White House, often heard shouting questions during the president’s brief Q&As with the press. In fact, Trump fielded one of his questions on Friday. The incident in the White House Rose Garden on July 11 made headlines at the time. Trump held what he called a “social media summit” of influential online supporters, including some fringe radio hosts and extremist social media personalities. As the summit wrapped up, Karem tried to shout questions to the president. He says some of the pro-Trump attendees made critical comments back at him. “Don’t be sad,” someone was heard saying to Karem in a video of the incident. “This is a group of people that are eager for demonic possession,” he said to some of the attendees. Some of them seemed to laugh. But Gorka responded angrily and questioned if Karem is really a journalist. Karem waved Gorka over to him. “Come on over here and talk to me, brother. We can go outside and have a long conversation.” The two men briefly traded barbs, with Gorka saying “you’re not a journalist, you’re a punk.” Videos of the incident went viral on social media and both men were criticized for their behavior. The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple called the spat “a battle of loudmouths.” The White House is asserting that Karem’s conduct should be sanctioned through a suspension of his press pass. Boutrous, on the other hand, tweeted that “the only person who should be banned from the White House as a result of this exchange” is Gorka. Playboy signaled on Friday night that the magazine will stand with Karem: “Suspension of credentialed press by the government is incredibly concerning. We are working with our lawyers to appeal the decision.” The magazine added, “Since 1953, Playboy has fought to protect First Amendment rights, and the fight must continue today.” All Content by CompareCards Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "articles": "The first of two -sponsored Democratic presidential debates is over. I watched – from the debate site in Detroit – and jotted down some of the best and worst performances from the 10 candidates on stage. My picks of the winners and losers from Tuesday night’s debate (in no particular order) are below. *Bernie Sanders: The Vermont senator clearly got the message that he wasn’t lively or active enough in the first debate of the cycle. He came out feisty – and stayed that way. Asked about former Maryland Rep. John Delaney’s criticism of his health care plan, Sanders responded bluntly, “You’re wrong.” Questioned about his single-payer “Medicare for All” plan, Sanders snapped, “I wrote the damn bill.” Sure, Sanders probably came across to some people as irascible and scoldy. But for liberals looking for Sanders to stand up proudly and unapologetically for the need for huge structural change in our politics and our culture got exactly what they wanted. And not for nothing, Sanders clearly outshone Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in this debate. *Steve Bullock: The Montana governor, to his immense credit, understood that this debate was his one big chance to make an impression with voters – and move from the third tier upward. I’m not sure if his numbers will move in a major way, but Bullock went for it – from his opening statement on. He made clear, time and time again, that he did not believe that the liberal views of Warren and Sanders were grounded in reality and did believe that those views would cost Democrats the election. He blasted “wish-list economics” and talked about the need to solve the “here and now” problems rather than offering what he views as unworkable pie-in-the-sky policies. If moderates were looking for someone other than former Vice President Joe Biden to support in this primary, Bullock offered himself as a viable alternative. * Pete Buttigieg: As in the first debate, the South Bend, Indiana mayor played it (relatively) safe. But unlike the first debate, there was a clear message: I am young, yes, but the older people on stage with me haven’t fixed any of these problems, so it’s time for something different. I think it’s smart for Buttigieg to a) own his age (he’s 37) and b) try to turn it from a perceived weakness into a strength. The idea that politics (and politicians in both parties) have failed and it’s time to give a whole new generation of politicians a chance has always been a powerful one – especially in a time where people on all sides of the political spectrum hate politics. That said, there were moments in this debate where Buttigieg leaned too far into his own mystique; “The racial divide lives within me,” he said at one point. Dude, what?  Democratic debate: Night one by the numbers *John Delaney: Before this debate, no one knew who Delaney was or what he believed. If you watched this debate, both of those questions were answered. That doesn’t mean you necessarily loved Delaney, as he quite clearly embraced a moderate view on almost everything. But Delaney’s repeated clashes with Sanders and Warren were a win for the former Maryland congressman in the very fact that they existed. Yes, Warren dunked on Delaney over what she insisted was his emphasis on what Democrats can’t or shouldn’t do, but all in all, this was a very good debate for him. * Elizabeth Warren: Her retort to Delaney was the line of the night – and encapsulates for a lot of Democrats why it’s so important to nominate someone who is willing to take on big fights, unapologetically. And her answer on electability – that no one thought Donald Trump could win – was pitch-perfect. *Donald Trump: An extended conversation about eliminating all private insurance. A top-tier candidate – Warren – fully embracing decriminalizing illegal immigration. All of that is music to the President’s ears. Remember that his poll numbers – job approval that has never broken 50%, etc. – suggest that there is no positive message that wins Trump a second term. Which means he needs as much fodder as possible to cast Democrats as deeply out of touch and representative of a creeping socialism. He got plenty on Tuesday night. *Opening statements: I really liked the fact that each of the candidate got a chance, right at the top of the debate, to lay out who they are and what they believe. It felt like a policy-centric and abundantly fair way of starting off a debate for president, and each candidate used the time well to make their case. *”Emotional turbulence” and “dark psychic forces:” God bless Marianne Williamson. We’ll miss you in future debates. *Beto O’Rourke: The former Texas congressman needed a good debate. A much better one than he had last month. While he was mildly more energetic than in the first debate – his answer on Trump’s weaponizing of race was O’Rourke’s best moment in either debate – there were large swaths of the debate where he simply disappeared from the conversation. And too many times when he did have a chance to speak, he sounded too rehearsed and wooden, a problem that plagued him in the first debate. O’Rourke has already qualified for the third and fourth debates this fall, so he won’t be going anywhere anytime soon. But if this was seen by his campaign as a chance to change the downward narrative (and spiral) surrounding his bid, I don’t think they got it. Fact check: 's Democratic debate *Amy Klobuchar: Ask yourself this: If you watched, what do you remember about the Minnesota senator’s debate performance? Maybe it’s her emphasis in her opening statement on her unblemished record of victory in campaigns? Maybe? That’s a problem for Klobuchar, who seems to be treading water in search of a moment or a surge. She didn’t get one tonight. And candidly, she didn’t really come close. *Elizabeth Warren: Yes, she made both lists. She had moments, without question (See: Winners). But Sanders seemed to better and more strongly articulate the liberal positions that define both of their campaigns, repeatedly. And Warren’s high-profile embrace of decriminalizing illegal immigration will add fuel to the fire for the already existing concerns among some Democrats that she is taking positions that could make her unelectable in a general election. *Anecdotes: Some consultant somewhere some time ago told a candidate that the best way to “connect with voters” is to tell a story about “Bill from Buffalo,” who has had some sort of terrible misfortune and was done wrong by the government. Can we all agree that this anecdote-driven empathy needs to end? It’s not effective. It feels totally pre-planned and scripted. It tells us zero about what a candidate would do for the country as a whole. Enough!

        "articles": "() – Barbara Bush, daughter of former President George W. Bush, wants Hillary Clinton to run for president. The 31 year-old CEO of the nonprofit Global Health Corps said she wants to see a Clinton run in 2016 in the upcoming Aug. 26 issue of People Magazine. During an interview that focused primarily on her volunteer work, Barbara Bush called Clinton \"unbelievably accomplished.\" But a Clinton vote by the Bush twin, herself unaffiliated politically, is not guaranteed. \"I don't know who she'd be running against,\" said the daughter of the Republican president. That would be half more than you have. There are many republicans who want to see her run – her \"What difference does it make\" how four Americans were murdered (under my watch, by the way) will haunt her forever – way beyond any election. She has exposed herself for all to see – a callous, self-serving woman who will do anything (including criminal acts) for her political ambitions. She is not worthy to hold the office of the presidency – there are many other women who surpass her by leaps and bounds – in intelligence and especially – integrity. In reference to the last comment spoken regarding the GOP by Gov. Christie: Mr. Paine I gladly second your motion!!!!!!! You are making accusations that lack credibility let alone evidence. The four murdered State Department people were in a foreign country with a significant Al Queda presence and were victims of violence that we can't always predict let alone stop. I mean, if we're keeping score, over 3,000 Americans were killed IN AMERICA under the last republican president! But I am not blaming President Bush for that, he didn't want it to happen and he had to deal with it just like President Obama and (former) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had to do when the attacks occurred in Libya. @ Freedom. How do you hold someone responsible for actions of others. You didn't mention all the people that died on Bush watch both of them. The 2nd Bush got re-elected. Hillary, what difference does it make, clinton? I don't think so, and I would've in 2008 There were many more diplomats killed while Bush was president than now under Obama. Also, Republicans cut funding for security for our diplomats in 2 consecutive budgets, now they scream that the diplomats don't have security \"She is not worthy to hold the office of the presidency \" Aaaaaw, gonna challenge her berf surtifikit too when she gets elected in 2016? Repeat after me: \"President Clinton.\" Watching your faces pucker over those words is going to be delightful. Hillary will do a great job. She is respected all over the world. \"Too bad Just sayin, Ricky McDaniel and a few others are never called on the carpet for their predictable behavior.\" Considering they are all one in the same ... I wouldn't count on it.",

        "articles": "Donald Trump on Wednesday scrambled to clarify his position on abortion He ignited a firestorm of criticism after he initially said women who obtain abortions should be punished Donald Trump scrambled to clarify his position on abortion Wednesday after he said women who undergo the procedure should face “some form of punishment” should the practice be outlawed. Several hours later – after widespread condemnation from Trump’s presidential rivals and even leading anti-abortion groups – he walked back his remarks, releasing a statement in which he said that women who obtain abortions are victims and that doctors who perform the service are the ones who should be punished. READ: Trump’s bizarre war on women “If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,” Trump said. “The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed – like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.” Clinton: Trump's comments on abortion 'unacceptable' The controversy also comes less than a week before Wisconsin Republicans vote in the state’s primary, a contest both Trump and his rivals have portrayed as pivotal in the road to the GOP presidential nomination. Trump’s initial comments on Wednesday came after a lengthy exchange with MSNBC host Chris Matthews, who pressured the Republican to give a yes or no answer to the question, “should abortion be punished.” READ: What we’ve learned about Trump’s world view “There has to be some form of punishment,” Trump said during a televised town hall event. “For the woman?” Matthews asked, to which Trump replied, “Yes.” Trump explains his worldview in new interview Trump declined to specify how women should be punished if they underwent an illegal abortion. READ: Republican candidates back off pledges to support nominee The Republican front-runner also conceded that outlawing the practice would lead some women to seek out abortions illegally. “Well, you go back to a position like they had where they would perhaps go to illegal places, but we have to ban it,” Trump said during the town hall. Trump had previously declined to answer the question about what penalties he would support for women who undergo abortions or doctors who perform them. “I just don’t want to talk about that right now,” Trump said during a news conference January in Iowa. “Everybody knows my views and I think my views are very plain,” Trump said. Throughout his campaign, Trump has faced questions about the authenticity of his position on abortion. He said he was “pro-choice in every respect” in a 1999 interview, though he said he hated the “concept of abortion.” His comments on Wednesday appeared to be the latest in Trump’s persistent efforts to court the support of socially conservative voters. But his efforts backfired as three leading anti-abortion groups swiftly criticized Trump’s comments. How Trump's comments on women play out in the polls March for Life released the toughest statement of the three groups, calling Trump’s remarks “completely out of touch with the pro-life movement.” “Being pro-life means wanting what is best for the mother and the baby. Women who choose abortion often do so in desperation and then deeply regret such a decision. No pro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion. This is against the very nature of what we are about,” the president of the group’s education and defense fund, Jeanne Marcini, said in a statement. The National Right to Life Committee noted in a statement that it has never supported penalties against women who undergo abortions. The Susan B. Anthony List chalked up Trump’s comments to his recent opposition to abortion rights and said punishments should only be dished out to “the abortionist.” “As a convert to the pro-life movement, Mr. Trump sees the reality of the horror of abortion – the destruction of an innocent human life – which is legal in our country up until the moment of birth,” the group’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said in a statement. Trump and his campaign increasingly have been under the microscope for their treatment of women. Trump has faced constant criticism throughout his campaign for comments he has made about women’s looks – from Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly to his former GOP opponent Carly Fiorina – and he has also taken flack in the last week for launching an attack against Sen. Ted Cruz’s wife. Trump adviser, pundit spar over wife tweet After a super PAC opposed to Trump and unaffiliated with Cruz’s campaign posted an ad featuring a nude photo of Trump’s wife, the Republican front-runner threatened to “spill the beans” about Cruz’s wife and tweeted an unflattering photo of Cruz’s wife alongside a picture of his own wife. The Texas senator held a campaign event in Wisconsin Wednesday morning, appearing alongside his wife and Fiorina in which he pitched himself to women voters. The scrutiny over the Trump campaign’s treatment of women continued this week after Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was charged Tuesday with simple battery for grabbing a female reporter’s arm after a news conference in Florida earlier this month. And earlier Wednesday, 16 female conservatives called on Trump to fire Lewandowski. Trump didn’t mention the abortion controversy while speaking at a campaign event here on Wednesday, shortly after the comments were made public. But, regarding the charges against Lewandowski, Trump said, “Nobody’s a bigger supporter of women than Donald Trump.” While Trump has maintained throughout his presidential campaign that he is steadfastly opposed to abortion, the Republican front-runner has also sought to distinguish himself from his GOP opponents on women’s issues. RELATED: Cruz, two super PACs hit Trump on abortion, ‘New York values’ As his GOP rivals for the presidency joined Republicans in Congress in calling for the federal government to defund Planned Parenthood following allegations over the summer that the group illegally sold aborted fetal tissue, Trump has insisted that the organization provides essential services to “millions of women.” Trump has called for the group to cease its abortion services – which are not funded by federal tax dollars – to continue receiving federal funding. Still, Trump’s comments Wednesday also drew a swift rebuke from Planned Parenthood’s advocacy arm, which called Trump’s comments “flat-out dangerous.” “Women’s lives are not disposable. There’s nothing else to say, as Donald Trump’s remarks today have said it all,” Executive Vice President of Planned Parenthood Action Fund Dawn Laguens said in a statement. The town hall comments were met with immediate criticism from presidential contenders on both sides of the aisle. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton retweeted an NBC News reporter, adding, “Just when you thought it couldn’t get worse. Horrific and telling. -H.” Just when you thought it couldn't get worse. Horrific and telling. -H  Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted, “Your Republican frontrunner, ladies and gentlemen. Shameful.” Your Republican frontrunner, ladies and gentlemen. Shameful.  Trump’s Republican opponents quickly responded as well. Ohio Gov. John Kasich told MSNBC, “Of course, women shouldn’t be punished for having an abortion.” And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said Trump’s comment “demonstrated that he hasn’t seriously thought through the issues, and he’ll say anything just to get attention.” “On the important issue of the sanctity of life, what’s far too often neglected is that being pro-life is not simply about the unborn child; it’s also about the mother – and creating a culture that respects her and embraces life,” Cruz said. “Of course we shouldn’t be talking about punishing women; we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they have to bring life into the world.” ’s Noah Gray contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "President Donald Trump's Justice Department ended DACA Tuesday with a six-month window Rep. Steve King does not want there to be a legislative fix to save DACA recipients Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, an immigration hardliner, said Wednesday that Congress does not have to do anything to protect young immigrants who came to the country illegally as children. Instead, King said they can “live in the shadows.” “They continue to live the objective that they sought to achieve when they illegally entered America,” King told reporters. “Live in the shadows.” King’s comments came after the Trump administration announced Tuesday that it would end the Obama-era program known as DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, in six months. The delayed deadline is meant to give Congress time to find a legislative solution to protect DACA recipients from deportation, but some, like King, say that the group shouldn’t expect Congress to act. In an interview with , King said that forcing young immigrants to live in the shadows was “justice.” Democrats threaten Senate logjam without stand-alone vote on DACA “Live in the shadows and if you get crossways with the law, then the law requires they be placed in criminal proceedings and go home. I think there’s justice there, but we need to provide justice,” King said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, meanwhile, told his conference Tuesday morning that he was prepared to seek a legislative solution for DACA recipients if it was paired with border security. “I think it’s totally reasonable and appropriate that when you take a look at the DACA dilemma, this is a dilemma that in large part stems from the fact that it is a symptom of a larger problem, and the larger problem is that we do not have control of our borders. So it’s only reasonable and fitting that we also address the root cause of the problem which is borders that are not sufficiently controlled while we address this very real and very human problem that’s right in front of us,” Ryan told reporters after meeting with House GOP members. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Beto O’Rourke has taken questions from the crowds at nearly all of his more than 150 events as a presidential candidate – and in his  town hall Tuesday night, it showed. The former Texas congressman spent the first two months of his bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination collecting details and anecdotes along the campaign trail, often writing them down in a notebook. He’s now using those stories to underscore the human impact of the policies of President Donald Trump, at which he is taking aim. Here are six takeaways from O’Rourke’s  town hall: O’Rourke’s habit of punctuating his message with examples he’s heard on the trail – with details of who told him and where – was on display when he recalled a girl who’d wondered whether, as an immigrant, she had a place in the United States. He said a Muslim family heard him relay that story in Houston and told him they’d been asked by their young daughter whether they were in the wrong country. He turned that into a stinging rebuke of Trump, citing the President’s attacks on Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who is Muslim, and his comments after white supremacists’ violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Trump, O’Rourke said, “does not just offend our ears and our sensibilities. He makes possible the acts of violence and hatred we’re seeing play out in this country today.” For weeks, O’Rourke has called for Congress to begin the process of impeaching Trump. On Tuesday, he took another step, breaking with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has warned that doing so could energize Trump’s base ahead of the 2020 election. He said Democrats should “look past those short-term consequences” and focus on obtaining documents and evidence. The only way to do so, he said, is to “compel the testimony, the furnishing of those documents, through impeachment proceedings.” O’Rourke cited the White House’s refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas and Attorney General William Barr’s failure to show up at a House hearing in recent weeks in his rationale for calling for impeachment proceedings. At stake, he said, are the “very sanctity of the ballot box and the very future of the world’s greatest democracy.” “If we do nothing because we are afraid of the polls or the politics, or the repercussions in the next election, we will set a precedent that, in fact, some people, because of the position of power and public trust that they hold, are above the law,” he said. The early stages of O’Rourke’s campaign were all about a personal touch. He has driven more than 6,000 miles himself, sometimes holding six town halls per day in the early-voting states. But that focus on meeting individual voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada has come with a cost: He hasn’t gained the national audience that other contenders have picked up with televised town halls and interviews. Tuesday was part of an effort to change that – but O’Rourke also launched a new feature on his campaign website called “Town Hall for America.” His site now includes a button at the top of its homepage that allows people to submit questions. “I will do my best to get you an answer to each and every single one of those and get you an answer. That level of accountability will make me a better candidate and I hope a better president for you and others,” O’Rourke said. A resident of El Paso who can see Ciudad Juárez over the US-Mexico border from his porch, O’Rourke’s strongest issue has long been immigration. He called for an immigration overhaul that would include giving so-called Dreamers – undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children – citizenship and creating a path to citizenship for other undocumented immigrants currently in the United States. “Let’s do this together, and let’s not do it as Democrats or independents or Republicans, but let’s do it as Americans: Let’s rewrite our immigration laws in our own image,” O’Rourke said Tuesday night. He criticized Trump’s family separation policy, saying he would “never again separate another family when they come here at their most vulnerable and desperate moment.” O’Rourke also sharply criticized the President for seeking to cut off $500 million in US aid to the Northern Triangle – a region that encompasses El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where many asylum seekers have fled violence. “He wants to cut that. I would double it, and I would focus it on violence prevention so that no mother has to make that god-awful decision of sending her child on that 2,000-mile trek,” O’Rourke said. “That’s the wisest, best use of our resources in this hemisphere.” O’Rourke was ready to roll out a plan to protect women’s reproductive rights – and got what might have been his biggest applause of the night from the crowd at Drake University for it. “As president, I will make sure that every nominee to every federal bench, including the Supreme Court, understands and believes Roe v. Wade is the settled law of the land,” O’Rourke said. His comment comes as Republican-led states – with Alabama at the forefront – enact restrictive laws that all but ban abortion, a series of moves aimed at having the Supreme Court, with a 5-4 conservative majority after Trump’s two appointments, take up the issue. O’Rourke’s campaign sent reporters the details of his plan, which includes appointing an attorney general who would defend abortion rights; lifting limits on doctors to provide women with information on how they can safely and legally access abortion; seeking the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal dollars from funding abortions; and prohibiting restrictions that bar insurance companies from covering abortions. O’Rourke got personal at times, discussing his father, Pat O’Rourke, a local politician in El Paso who was killed when his bicycle was struck by an automobile in 2001. “I’d like to think that he would be proud, the way that we’re doing this. Being with people, having fun, all about connecting with folks where they are, where they live. My dad, Pat O’Rourke, never met a stranger. Loved every second of being alive. Found total joy in serving others,” he said. He also talked about working as a live-in nanny briefly in New York City after graduating from Columbia University. “So I, after college I was trying to live in the city, trying to live in New York, and I was working full time but I still didn’t have enough money to pay the rent,” O’Rourke said. A family, he said, made an offer he couldn’t refuse. O’Rourke agreed to watch their children after school and on weekends, walking them to school and making them breakfast in exchange for an apartment above theirs. “Great deal. And so I took them up on that, and a great experience early on,” he said. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.  Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.",

The judiciary committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism announced earlier this week it had scheduled former acting-Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to testify at a May 8 hearing as part of that committee’s investigation into the Russia matter. The subcommittee is led by GOP Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina. The Senate and House intelligence committees also have open investigations into the matter. In multiple public appearances, Comey has forcefully defended his controversial decisions with regard to the 2016 election. Last fall before the House judiciary committee, Comey defended the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state, saying, “You can call us wrong, but don’t call us weasels.” At a more recent public appearance, Comey said the FBI had to act without regard to what political side may or may not benefit. ’s Mary Kay Mallonee contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "President Donald Trump Tuesday signed a measure nixing a regulation aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of some severely mentally ill people. The original rule was part of a series of efforts taken by the Obama administration to try and curb gun violence after other efforts failed to advance in Congress. Using the Congressional Review Act – which allows Congress to roll back regulations imposed by the executive branch – the Republican-controlled House and Senate voted to send the bill to Trump’s desk. The regulation, finalized in December under Obama’s tenure, required the Social Security Administration to disclose information quarterly to the national gun background check system about certain people with mental illness. While the list of eligible mental disorders is long – ranging from anxiety to eating disorders to schizophrenia –those who would have been reported by the agency had to meet two main criteria: a) They were receiving full disability benefits because of a mental illness and couldn’t work and b) they were unable to manage their own benefits, thus needing the help of a third party to do so. The Obama administration estimated that the new rule would have affected roughly 75,000 individuals annually. And according to a report by the Office of the Inspector General at the Social Security Administration, 81,000 disability awardees would have met the criteria in fiscal year 2015, which amounts to about 9% of the total disability awardee population. Those affected would have been notified both orally and in writing that they could potentially be prevented from buying a gun. Such individuals would have been allowed to request a relief from any firearm prohibitions if they could show evidence that they didn’t pose a risk to public safety. While the rule wasn’t effective until January 18, compliance was not required until later this year – in December. So it’s unlikely that anyone has been affected by the rule. Interestingly, the rule had opponents across a wide spectrum. Both the National Rifle Association and the American Civil Liberties Union spoke out against it. The ACLU, which advocates for people with mental health struggles, said the rule reinforced a stereotype that people with mental disabilities are violent. The organization argued in a letter to members of Congress that there’s no data to support a connection between receiving disability benefits and a propensity toward gun violence. Susan Mizner, senior attorney with the disability rights program at the ACLU, also said that people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims of violence. While proponents of the rule argue that it only affects a limited group, opponents say that it unfairly targets the wrong people. “75,000 people a year is a lot of people in my book,” Mizner said. “And these are people who are already at the bottom of our social status. We don’t need to kick them anymore.” Gun control groups and activists supported the rule because they felt it would prevent some suicides and accidental deaths. They argued that it helped enforced laws already in the books that require mental health reporting by federal agencies, said Lindsay Nichols, senior attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “The American people and the families that are being hurt day after day by gun violence – they deserve some due process too,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.  Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.",

        "articles": "By Brian Ries, Veronica Rocha, Meg Wagner, Sophie Tatum, Maegan Vazquez and Jessie Yeung,  From 's Brian Ries The Google Trends Twitter account tweeted this morning that the search phrase \"Dónde votar\" (\"where to vote\" in Spanish) is the top trending search on Google in the US today -- spiking 3,350%. In addition, three of the top five trending Google search topics in the US right now are midterms-related, with the 'polling place' topic spiking +350%, 'voting' increasing +300%, and 'election day' increasing +300%. From 's Greg Wallace Voters were locked out of a polling place in Brooklyn, New York, for about 90 minutes on Tuesday morning, according to a city elections official. Voting at the Breukelen Community Center began around 7:30 a.m., said Valerie Vazquez, the communications director for the New York City Board of Elections. The site had been scheduled to open at 6 a.m. The polling site is a New York City Housing Authority property and poll workers could not open an electronic lock on the building, Vazquez said. She did not have immediate information on how many voters were affected. The Rhode Island Secretary of State has tweeted \"we have had some reports of voters receiving incorrect polling place information from 3rd party applications.\"  has reached out for more information. From 's David Williams New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez voted on Tuesday morning at 7:14 a.m. at the Harrison Community Center in Harrison, New Jersey. He gave two thumbs up as he walked out of the voting booth. There was some applause as he walked away. The embattled Democrat is in a close race with Republican Bob Hugin, but Republicans have not won a Senate race in New Jersey since 1972. From 's Brandon Miller As polls are opening there is a line of showers and storms that extends from Western New York down the Appalachians and extends into Alabama and Mississippi -- with the strongest storms to the south. The storms have diminished in severity this morning and the only Tornado Watch still in effect as polls open is for a few counties in Northern Georgia until 10 a.m. ET. The rain will travel eastward through the day and will move through the metro areas of Philadelphia, Washington DC, and Charlotte, North Carolina in the early afternoon hours. In fact, every state east of the Mississippi River is likely to see rain at some point, though some states will undoubtedly see more storms and potentially disruptive weather than others. Several of 's top ten races to watch will be impacted by the weather, including Virginia's 7th District, New Jersey's 7th District, Georgia's 6th District and Florida's governor's race. Weather can play a significant role in voting behavior, with lousy conditions possibly suppressing turnout. From 's Gianluca Mezzofiore Voting is underway in a number of states. Here are a few photos of voters doing what they do best: Voting (or at least waiting in line to do just that). Analysis by Harry Enten The 2018 campaign (mostly) comes to an end today. If the polls and our forecasts are right, the Democrats and Republicans will each have something to be happy about. Democrats are favored to take back the House, while Republicans are favored to maintain control of the Senate. Our final House forecast has Democrats earning 227 seats to the Republicans 208. That's a net gain of 32 seats from the 195 they hold right now. Democrats only need a net gain of 23 to win the 218 seats necessary for a majority. But as we have noted all along, our forecasts come with a margin of error. Specifically, our 95% confidence interval finds that Democrats could win as few as 207 seats (11 short of a majority) to as many 255. Our final Senate forecast is something else altogether. It has Republicans controlling 52 seats and Democrats (and Independents who caucus with them) holding 48 seats in the next Congress. If this forecast were exactly right, it would mean that Republicans would have a net gain of a seat since the last Congress. Note: These aren't our official projections -- we'll get to those later tonight. These are forecasts and they're not going to be perfect. Anything within the stated range could reasonably happen, though we expect the result to be close to our best estimate. Polls in a number of states open shortly, so while you're getting up and out the door, here are six quick reads to start your Election Day. From 's Christina Maxouris and Saeed Ahmed Good morning!

        "articles": "Authors: Last five years have seen more indicted in extremist violence They say the threats have grown from domestic sources, particularly the right wing Jihadist groups no longer make up the greater threat, they say Authors: It's about time for politicians to notice the shifting threat Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is ’s national security analyst, the author of “Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden – From 9/11 to Abbottabad” and a director at the New America Foundation. Jennifer Rowland is a program associate at the New America Foundation. On the evening of March 19, Tom Clements, the director of Colorado’s prison system, was shot and killed when he answered the door of his home near Colorado Springs. The slaying sparked a police chase that ended a few days later in Texas, with authorities finally killing the suspect, 28-year-old Evan Ebel, in a shootout. It was soon discovered that Ebel had been part of a violent white supremacist gang during the eight years he spent in Colorado prisons. Clements was the latest victim of increasingly active violent right-wing extremists. While American politicians and the U.S. public continue to focus on the threat from jihadist extremists, there seems to be too little awareness that this domestic form of political violence is a growing problem at home. From 2002 to 2007, only nine right-wing extremists were indicted for their roles in politically motivated murders and other types of ideologically motivated violent assaults. But between 2008 and 2012, the number mushroomed to 53, according to data collected by the New America Foundation. (Click on chart on the left for the data.) Fifteen right-wing extremists were indicted in 2012 – including six who were involved in a militia in Georgia that accumulated weapons, plotted attacks on the government and murdered a young U.S. Army soldier and his 17-year-old girlfriend, who they suspected were planning to rat out the group to authorities. Seven claimed membership in the anti-government Sovereign Citizens movement and allegedly murdered two policemen in Louisiana. And two had gone on a murderous rampage the previous year, killing four people before they were arrested in California, where they told police they were on their “way to Sacramento to kill more Jews.” By comparison, in 2012, only six people who subscribed to al Qaeda’s ideology were indicted on terrorism-related charges in the United States, confirming the trend of the past four years, which is a sharp decline in such cases that has been documented by the authors in previous pieces for .com. It’s about time that politicians who are quick to talk about the threat posed by al Qaeda began paying attention to the shifting nature of the threats. In comparing the two sources of domestic terrorism, it’s striking that the jihadists charged with crimes were much less likely to have actually carried out a violent attack before they were arrested. According to data gathered by the New America Foundation, 207 people motivated by al Qaeda’s ideology of violence against American targets have been indicted in the U.S. on terrorism-related charges since 9/11. But only about 5% of those were indicted for their roles in violent incidents, whereas of the 139 right-wing militants indicted in the United States since 9/11, just under half had engaged in a violent attack before they were arrested. Widow: Error won't bring my husband back Neighbor: Colorado suspect always angry The word “terrorism” is not often used in the charges leveled against these right-wing militants, simply because laws in the United States primarily define terrorism as the work of a designated foreign terrorist group. But the New America data shows that domestic terrorists motivated by non-jihadist ideologies now pose a similar or even greater threat than those who admire al Qaeda. We define non-jihadist terrorists to be those who carry out or aspire to carry out acts of politically motivated violence, and who fall into the following categories: right-wing extremists who oppose the government, subscribe to a neo-Nazi ideology, or oppose homosexuality or abortion; left-wing extremists; violent animal rights activists; and violent environmental activists. Over the past several years, acts or plots of non-jihadist terrorism have derived almost entirely from right-wing extremists like the soldiers’ militia in Georgia and the anti-government group in Louisiana. Of the 54 non-jihadist terrorists indicted between 2010 and 2012, 47 were right-wing extremists. Seven were leftists or animal rights extremists. For instance, three were participants in Occupy Chicago, a leftist political movement, and were indicted on terrorism charges last June for plotting to throw Molotov cocktails at President Barack Obama and other officials during a NATO summit in Chicago. Their lawyers say an undercover government agent had urged them to plot the attacks and build the firebombs. Since 9/11, at least 29 people living in the United States have been killed by right-wing extremists, while 17 have been killed by jihadist extremists, the majority of whom died in one incident: the 2009 massacre at Fort Hood, Texas. Of course, this story would be much different if al Qaeda recruit Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab had detonated a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas Day 2009. Join us on Twitter and Facebook But it would also be much different if city workers hadn’t spotted a suspicious backpack left on the route of a Martin Luther King Jr. parade in Spokane, Washington, in January 2011, in which white supremacist Kevin Harpham had hidden a bomb packed with fishing weights coated in rat poison. Or if police hadn’t discovered a napalm bomb and several other live, wired explosives in the suburban Cleveland home of right-wing extremist Matthew Fairfield in April 2010. And of all the people indicted on terrorism charges in the United States since 9/11, no jihadist suspect has ever acquired or attempted to acquire chemical, biological or radiological weapons, while at least 11 right- and left-wing terrorists either obtained such materials or made serious attempts to do so. In 2003, federal agents discovered “nearly two pounds of a cyanide compound and other chemicals that could create enough poisonous gas to kill everyone inside a space as large as a big-chain bookstore or a small-town civic center” at the home of Judith Bruey and her husband, William Krar, according to an Associated Press report. Alongside the arsenal of chemical weapons were about 60 pipe bombs, several machine guns, remote-controlled bombs disguised as briefcases, and anti-Semitic, anti-black, and anti-government literature, the report said. Although the feds had been tracking Bruey and Krar in the mid-90s, their case fell through the cracks when the events of 9/11 turned law enforcement’s attention to jihadist terrorism. The couple was only found out when Krar tried to mail a package of counterfeit birth certificates to an anti-government militia member in New Jersey, but got the address wrong. That mistake resulted in a tip to local police. A report from the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point released in January found that, “In the last few years, and especially since 2007, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of attacks and violent plots originating from people and groups who self-identify with the far-right of American politics.” In a report that was much criticized at the time, the Department of Homeland Security predicted in 2009 that the nation’s election the previous year of its first black president, along with a severe economic downturn that created disenchantment with the government among poorer populations, had the potential to radicalize greater numbers of right-wing terrorists. The same report warned that increasing numbers of returning military veterans as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down provided those on the far right with a vulnerable population to target for radicalization. The New America Foundation data shows that about 20% of the right-wing extremists indicted since 9/11 had spent time in the military. The New America data supports the Department of Homeland Security’s assessment of the growing threat of right-wing extremist groups. American politicians and the public should become more aware of the fact that while the threat from al Qaeda-inspired terrorists is much diminished at home, the threat from right-wing militants continues to rise.

        "articles": "Hillary Clinton hailed the deal that the United States and other world powers struck with Iran on Tuesday as an “important step in putting a lid on Iran’s nuclear program.” What’s bound to draw attention as the agreement’s political ramifications come into focus: Clinton owns a piece of it. She helped the negotiations get started. The Democratic presidential front-runner said President Barack Obama – who tapped her as America’s top diplomat in his first term in office – called her late Monday night to tell her that negotiators had struck a deal: Iran will rein in its nuclear program and allow for close monitoring. Hillary Clinton: Iran deal 'an important step' After a Tuesday morning meeting with House Democrats on Capitol Hill, Clinton tread carefully, saying she hadn’t yet been brought up to date on the specifics of the agreement. “Based on what I know now, and I will be being briefed as soon as I finish addressing you, this is an important step in putting the lid on Iran’s nuclear program,” she told reporters after that meeting. After her comments and between Capitol Hill meetings on Tuesday, Clinton received that briefing. Secretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and National Security Adviser Susan Rice briefed Clinton and other former secretaries of state and former national security advisers. Clinton made reference to her role in the negotiations, saying she was “part of building the coalition that brought us to the point of this agreement.” Her top policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, sought to direct some credit toward his boss as well Tuesday morning at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, saying she was “centrally involved in the outset of all of this.” RELATED: Get up to speed on the Iran nuclear talks Clinton explained her role in the negotiations in her memoir, “Hard Choices.” She wrote that she began back-channel talks with Iran through the sultan of Oman, who had helped free American hikers imprisoned on espionage charges and suggested the nuclear talks. She then had Sullivan, a top aide at the State Department, play a central role in getting the negotiations off the ground – flying to Oman, meeting with Iranians and eventually leading to a September 2013 phone call in which Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani agreed to formally pursue the negotiations. Her role in the Iran talks were a major reversal from the 2008 Democratic primary, in which she’d blasted Obama for agreeing to talk directly with Tehran without preconditions, saying he was “irresponsible and frankly naive.” On Tuesday, Clinton praised her successor as secretary of state, Kerry, as well as Moniz, and said she’d ensure it is followed if she wins the 2016 presidential race. “We have to treat this as an ongoing enforcement effort, which I certainly strongly support and as President would be absolutely devoted to ensuring that the agreement is followed,” Clinton added, leaving shortly thereafter without answering reporter questions. Her comments come as Republicans assail the deal – and hit Obama for agreeing to it. The GOP’s presidential field roundly criticized it on Tuesday, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio saying the President gave “concession after concession to a regime that has American blood on its hands” and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said it “isn’t diplomacy – it is appeasement.” RELATED: Now that he has a deal with Iran, Obama must face Congress It’s not yet clear whether lawmakers will even allow the White House to implement it. Republicans who control the Senate could push for a vote to block the deal. Due to some procedural wrangling in a bill earlier this year, Obama needs only 34 of the Senate’s 100 members to back him – but with Republicans all but guaranteed to oppose him and Democrats taking a cautious approach, that could be a tight vote. Clinton said Tuesday that even with the deal in place, the United States’ problems with Tehran’s regime won’t end. “This does put a lid on the nuclear program, but we still have a lot of concern about the bad behavior and the actions by Iran which remains the largest state sponsor of terrorism which does go after and undermine governments in the region, that poses an existential threat to Israel, that unfairly, unlawfully confines and tries Americans on trumped up charges,” she said. “That bad behavior is something we have to address.” ’s Deirdre Walsh and Sophie Tatum contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "The year’s biggest conservative confab features thousands of activists, elected officials and party leaders gathering for the Conservative Political Action Conference. But while they’re meeting at a convention center just outside of Washington, D.C., their minds — and rhetoric — are focused squarely on the White House and on attacking Hillary Clinton, the most likely Democratic nominee in 2016. Here’s every critical thing they said about her Thursday: This year’s CPAC marks the unofficial kickoff of the battle for the conservative vote among GOP presidential contenders. For some, like Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, the event will be a homecoming, a return to their most ardent and loyal supporters. READ: Conservatives party like it’s 2016 For others, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, CPAC represents a lion’s den, full of activists skeptical of his conservative chops and wary of his presidential aspirations. CPAC can put a potential contender on the map, as it did with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson last year, when the movement launched to draft him into the presidential race drew significant attention and he took third in the presidential straw poll. But it can also cripple a frontrunner, as it did when then-GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney called himself “severely conservative” at the 2012 convention. What does CPAC look like? check out the video below: Here’s what you need to know: 3 p.m. - Jeb Bush defended his positions on immigration – and made some breaks from hard-line conservatives – in front of a rowdy crowd Friday afternoon. The former Florida governor went all-in on his support for a giving undocumented immigrants a path to legal status, and for making in-state college tuition available for those immigrants. But he earned loud cheers from the crowd by saying he’d favor closing the U.S.-Mexico border first, before enacting any other immigration reforms, and for saying tens of thousands of Central American immigrants who arrived in Texas last summer should have been deported. And he punted on a question about Congress’ ongoing fight over funding the Department of Homeland Security and whether Republicans should stick with a measure that also defunds President Barack Obama’s immigration actions – even at the risk of shutting the department down. “I’m not an expert on the ways of Washington,” he said. Bush’s comments came in a highly-anticipated question-and-answer session with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Some members of the crowd walked out early in Bush’s appearance, and others interrupted him with jeers. But they were matched in volume by Bush’s supporters. 2016 hopeful Jeb Bush booed at CPAC Hannity put Bush on defense for much of the 25-minute session, quizzing him on his stances on two issues that could hurt him with the GOP base: immigration and the Common Core education standards. Bush used the education questions to tout his role as one of the nation’s leading conservative reformers, noting that Florida had launched the first statewide voucher program on his watch and offered a long list of choices that allow students and their parents to decide how to spend public education dollars. He also told the crowd that Republicans need to pivot from their opposition to Obama – who he called a “failed president” – to a more positive agenda in 2016. “It’s good to oppose the bad things, but we need to start being for things,” Bush said. The same, he said, goes for him – the candidate with a father and brother who were president. “I have to show what’s in my heart. I have to show that I care about people, about their future,” Bush said. “It can’t be about the past.” — Eric Bradner,  In between the seemingly endless parade of 2016 hopefuls – Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson had plenty of red meat to offer to CPAC’s conservative attendees, and advice to any potential Republican Candidates. “Carry two things wherever you go in case you become president – your bible and your woman,” The former A&E reality show was not shy in asserting his own unabashedly conservative beliefs. “I am a god-loving, bible-believing, gun-toting, capitalist,” Robertson declared to the crowd. Taking a decidedly spiritual tone, Robertson read mostly from religious texts and selected writing from George Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, imploring conservatives to hold onto America’s religious roots. “If you think I’m a little too religious for you, just listen to your founding fathers, the men that founded this country,” Robertson said, “then decide if I’m too religious for you.” Robertson also lamented the decline of the American family, citing CDC data on rates of sexually transmitted diseases as evidence of the U.S.’s moral decline. He also likened the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria to the rise of Hitler and Stalin before World War II, pointing to a lack of Christian values as a common strain in those two nations. “I don’t see a dime’s worth of different in any of them,” Robertson said. He closed with another nod to 2016. “If we don’t have spiritual men making political decisions, you’re going to lose this country,” Robertson warned. – Johnny Verhovek,  1:15 p.m. Former Sen. Rick Santorum pitched his foreign policy experience at CPAC on Friday as he laid out the radical Islamist threat the United States faces. “Commander in chief is not an entry level position. And the oval office is no place for on the job training, not in times like this,” said Santorum, who spent eight years on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Santorum had trouble building applause lines as a crowd of Sen. Rand Paul supporters filtered out of the room after Paul, a crowd favorite, left the stage. But the crowd’s enthusiasm grew as Santorum shifted focus from economics and the need to “stand for the little guy” to the threat of radical Islam. Santorum laid out his vision for a hawkish foreign policy, calling for a robust military and the need for the United States military to deploy 10,000 “boots on the ground” to defeat ISIS. Jeremy Diamond,  1 p.m. - Sen. Rand Paul while speaking to a friendly audience, stuck largely to his stump speech but also used his background as a physician to distinguish himself from the rest of the crowded field of potential presidential candidates. “As a doctor, I will take it and make it my mission to heal the nation, reverse the course of Obamacare, and repeal every last bit of it,” he said, adding that Chief Justice John Robert’s decision was the “mistake of the century.” The Kentucky Republican undoubtedly had the warmest reception from the young CPAC crowd, which has traditionally tilted in favor of the libertarian-leaning senator and previously his father, former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. The audience was the fullest yet in the massive ballroom, and chants of “President Paul” occasionally broke out. Paul ticked through his views on privacy and the Bill of Rights and rallied the crowd to its feet with a healthy dish of red meat, reiterating that it’s time for Hillary Clinton to “permanently retire” and calling for term limits for members of Congress. And while polls show momentum building towards a more aggressive U.S. response against ISIS, Paul tried to carefully walk the line of supporting a strong national defense while still holding onto his non-interventionist views. “Without question we must defend ourselves,” he said. “I envision an America with a National Defense unparalleled, undefeatable, and unencumbered by nation building.” 9:42 a.m. - Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry tried to leverage the experience that 14 years as a border-state governor gives him over the rest of the 2016 Republican presidential field during his Friday morning CPAC speech. Perry hit the issue of immigration hard, repeatedly touting his state’s efforts – which included deploying the National Guard – to stop an influx of undocumented minors that were crossing the U.S.-Mexico border last summer. He recalled a conversation with President Barack Obama during the President’s visit to Dallas last year. “I said to him, Mr. President, if you don’t secure this border, Texas will, and that’s exactly what we did,” he said. Asked about his plans for immigration reform, Perry offered no specifics, though. “If you do not secure the border first, you can’t have a conversation about immigration reform, that’s just a fact,” he said. He also called for “aviation assets” to monitor the border. Perry also slugged Obama – who was the sole focus of his speech and remarks in a subsequent question-and-answer session, unlike other Republicans who have hit Hillary Clinton or other party members – for his handling of foreign threats like ISIS. He said the United States must support Israel and be sure not to “grant Iran’s nuclear ambitions diplomatic cover.” Perry touted tax cuts and regulatory reforms enacted in Texas as a national model, and said that there’s “nothing wrong with America that cannot be fixed with new leadership.” Comparing Obama’s leadership to wars, depressions and Jimmy Carter, Perry said: “We’ve survived worse.”  spent time with Perry in New Hampshire recently. He kissed babies, shook hands, and tried to convince voters that 2015 Perry is a far different potential candidate than the one who “stepped in it” four years ago. Watch that below and read on for more from CPAC: 8:40 a.m. - For Sen. Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton is “yesterday.” That may be why, during his Friday-morning speech at CPAC, the potential presidential contender laid out his vision for a “new American century.” In a succinct address, the Florida senator said that while America’s still exceptional, “you wouldn’t know it by listening to the President, who’s described our nation as sometimes being arrogant or dictating terms to others.” “Our nation is on the decline,” he added. “The good news is, we are one election away from triggering another American century.” Rubio leaned heavily on his own personal story in his speech, referencing his family’s immigration to America and his working-class upbringing. “America doesn’t owe me anything,” he said, “but I have a debt to America.” And in a question-and-answer session with Sean Hannity, Rubio again drew a juxtaposition between the problems of the past and the solutions of the future. “We’re basically having the industrial revolution every five years — and our leaders are basically stuck in yesterday,” he said. In a rapid-fire word-association segment, Rubio described Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential frontrunner, as “yesterday,” Bill Clinton as “really yesterday,” and Obama as “failed.” But he was careful to keep controversy at arms length in the question-and-answer session, distancing himself from his role in passing the Senate immigration reform bill in 2013 that sparked heavy backlash from conservatives. He called for tougher border control and restrictions on legal immigration before addressing those in the U.S. illegally. “You can’t even begin to have a conversation about [immigrants in the U.S. illegally] until people believe, and know … that future illegal immigration will be controlled,” he said. 6:25 p.m. - Gov. Bobby Jindal laid out his criticism of Common Core, slammed President Barack Obama on the fight against radical Islam and reemphasized the need for immigrants to assimilate in the United States. Jindal’s one-liners may have been new to many in the crowd, but most of his speech was recycled from past appearances and resembled an address he delivered earlier this month at an American Principles Project event. Jindal also took the opportunity to knock Obama on remarks he made earlier this month at the National Prayer Breakfast. “I’ll keep my eye out for the medieval Christians,” Jindal said. “Why don’t you go out and win the war against radical Islam.” When taking questions, Jindal emphasized the time he’s spent in the last year putting out policy papers through his policy organization, America Next, noting that he’s staked out positions on everything from energy independence to alternatives to Obamacare and Common Core. 5:25 p.m. – Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker offered a blistering critique of President Barack Obama’s handling of the threat of “radical Islamic terrorism” on Thursday – but little substance on how he’d address the challenge himself. “We need a president, a leader, who will stand up and say, we will take the fight to them and not wait until they bring the fight to America’s soil, to our children and our grandchildren,” Walker said. Later, in a short opening speech, he added: “We need to show the world that in America, you have no better ally and no greater enemy. In America, we will stand up for what is right and stand against what is wrong.” Asked by an audience member about how he’d deal with the threat of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Walker responded that he gets FBI threat briefings from his adjutant general and that “without divulging confidential information,” he’s been concerned about the group for years. But he didn’t offer a specific answer to how he’d take on the group, instead pivoting back to his experience in Wisconsin. “If I can take on 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,” he said. It was a reference to Walker’s fight against labor unions in Wisconsin, where his move to strip public employees’ collective bargaining rights caused months of protests, forced him to survive a recall election, and turned him into a rock star on the right. Those fights were Walker’s comfort zone. He touted Republican efforts in Wisconsin to block government dollars from going to Planned Parenthood, to require photo IDs to vote, and to reduce regulations. He also pointed to a new GOP push to enact union-busting right-to-work legislation there. In making his pitch, Walker showcased the no-compromise rhetoric that has made him a conservative favorite. “We won in Wisconsin a state that hasn’t gone Republican for president since 1984. … We did it without compromising,” he said. “We stood up and said what we were gonna do, and then we did it.” - Eric Bradner,  4:55 PM – After he joined the 2012 presidential race, a brash Rick Perry quickly laid down a marker when asked how he differed from George W. Bush, another Texan who made it to the White House. “I went to Texas A&M,” Perry told reporters as he strolled confidently through the Iowa State Fair in late summer 2011. “He went to Yale.” Perry was drawing an unmistakable cultural contrast and making no secret about his frosty relationship with the Bush family. Today, with Perry and another Bush — Jeb — both looking at the presidency in 2016, the recently-departed Texas governor is this time staying away from direct attacks on the GOP’s most famous family. Asked if the country has an appetite for a third Bush presidency, Perry passed on needling the former Florida governor. “Really I think the country has an appetite to get the country back working,” he told  as he walked through the crowded hallways of CPAC on Thursday. “I don’t think the country cares what state they’re from.” Asked again about his relationship with the Bushes, Perry again punted. “I don’t think the country cares about anything other than who is going to get this country back working again, and who is going to have a foreign policy that is cogent, where are allies know who is going to be there for them, and when people who aren’t our friends cross red lines, there is a consequence,” Perry responded. “They could care less what state they’re from.” – Peter Hamby,  4:40 p.m. - Shortly after Carly Fiorina wrapped her speech to CPAC, where she repeatedly attacked former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s record on foreign policy issues, a pro-Clinton rapid response political organization reminded reporters of a time when the former Hewlett-Packard executive spoke at the Clinton family’s flagship organization. “#TBT that time @CarlyFiorina spoke at the Clinton Global Initiative. #CPAC2015,” the group Correct the Record tweeted on Thursday afternoon, a reference to the Throwback Thursday ritual of recalling times gone by on the social media outlet. The group also included a link to a press release including details of the May 2013 event, which was billed as an event gathering top CEOs and government officials on “boosting the economy.” “I think on balance it’s a positive thing, actually,” Fiorina says of the foundation in 2013. She added in an interview with Jake Tapper that “the Clinton Global Initiative does a lot of good work around the world,” but says that the group’s corporate ties will likely cause HRC problems if she runs. When asked about the Clinton critique, a spokeswoman for Fiorina turned the query back on the former first lady. “It’s a simple question: can they name a single accomplishment from her time as Secretary of State? They’ve been asked many times. I have yet to see an answer,” Sarah Isgur Flores said in an emailed statement. -Jedd Rosche and Dan Merica,  2:15 p.m. - Sen. Ted Cruz is hoping his kind of conservatism could “bring back the miracle that is America.” “America is in jeopardy and we are met totday in a great battlefield. The men and women who are gathered here today are gathered to fight for freedom in our country,” Cruz told his CPAC audience Thursday. Cruz, who has often set himself up at odds with the Republican leadership in Congress, said voters will need to “differentiate” between true conservatives and, essentially, posers. No one will say “‘I’m a squishy moderate that stands for nothing,’” Cruz joked before quoting Scripture: “You shall know them by their fruits.” “Demand action, not talk,” Cruz urged the audience of activists. “If a candidate tells you they oppose the debt and debt ceiling that are crushing our kids. Terrific. What if you stood up and fought against it.” As he has in past speeches, Cruz rallied the crowd by painting a stark contrast between Washington and what “the people want” and used it as an opportunity to take a shot at former former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom he said embodies Washington. Cruz’s speech was also full of one-liners slamming Obama and his healthcare law and attacks against Democrats, some of whom plan to boycott Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress next week. “There’s not a single Democrat here. It’s almost like CPAC invited Benjamin Netanyahu to speak,” Cruz joked. Cruz also likened himself to the car service app Uber: “What I’m trying to do more than anything else is bring a disruptive app to politics.” And in a lighting round with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Cruz gave his top priorities for his first day in office if he were to be elected president, which included abolishing the IRS, repealing Obamacare and defending “our constitutional rights.” -Jeremy Diamond,  1:45 p.m. – Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive who could be the only woman to enter the Republican race, took a series of shots at Hillary Clinton – who she challenged to “please name an accomplishment.” “Like Mrs. Clinton, I too have traveled the globe. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know that flying is an activity, not an accomplishment,” she said. Fiorina lambasted Clinton’s handling of the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya, and her “conflict of interest” when the Clinton Foundation reportedly accepted gifts from foreign governments during her tenure as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state. “She tweets about women’s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights. She tweets about equal pay for women but will not answer basic questions about her own offices’ pay standards – and neither will our President,” Fiorina said. “Hillary may like hashtags. But she doesn’t know what leadership means.” Fiorina also name-dropped the woman many liberals hope will challenge Clinton in the Democratic primary: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She channeled Warren’s populist appeal, saying she’d diagnosed similar problems but had a dramatically different take on the solutions. “Elizabeth Warren is right: crony capitalism is alive and well,” Fiorina said. “Government and government programs have grown so big, so powerful, so costly and so complex that only the big and the powerful can prosper. But Elizabeth Warren is dead wrong about how to end crony capitalism. You see, whether it is Dodd-Frank, Obamacare or net neutrality, all this government complexity means the big get bigger, the small disappear, and the powerless are trapped.” – Eric Bradner,  Related: Fiorina’s HP legacy looms over potential White House bid Related: Chances of Fiorina White House bid ‘way over 50%” 1:00 p.m. - Gov. Chris Christie sought to defend his brash style and counter narratives that he’s being outrun by Jeb Bush, saying it’s too early to make sweeping predictions. The New Jersey Republican sat on stage with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, where he dropped a round of anti-media digs — “I’m giving up the New York Times for Lent” — to counter recent narratives about a slowed momentum for the potential Christie campaign. “Is the election next week?” he asked, when pressed on his low standing in 2016 polls. “If I decide to run for president, I’m not worried what polls say 21 months before” the election. Asked how he’ll manage to outperform Bush, who’s tapping into his family’s vast network to collect a massive fundraising haul, Christie said “if the elites in Washington who make backroom deals” decide the nominee, then Bush would be the frontrunner. But, he argued, he’ll “do OK” if that decision is left up to the people. He also said that Bush’s previous proposal about repopulating Detroit with immigrants was “misrepresenting the priorities” and said he would focus more on the people already living in the city. Christie, as he’s been doing in early voting states lately, embraced his “Jersey guy” persona, saying people like to hear a direct, blunt politician. “Sometimes people need to be told to sit down and shut up,” he said, defending his outburst against a heckler in the fall. – ’s Ashley Killough Related: Christie answers questions after rocky month Related: Christie shoots for new political winds with pension proposal 9:00 A.M.: Ben Carson took the stage earlier than scheduled, but still found a packed auditorium and enthusiastic audience for a relatively subdued speech that unfolded like a laundry list of his policy priorities. Carson urged listeners, “let’s not turn our backs on Israel,” said Congress should offer an alternative to Obamacare before they repeal it, and defended conservatives’ opposition to same-sex marriage. It was a departure from last year’s speech, during which he railed with fiery rhetoric against the “P.C. police.” “We need to move in a very different direction,” Carson said, calling for the nation to move away from big government programs. He also, during the question-and-answer portion of his appearance, said the government should have a “safety net” to support those in need, but should eliminate programs that cause “dependency.” And he said that home-schoolers, in his estimation, perform better than public school educated students. – Alexandra Jaffe,  Carson is one of the more interesting newcomers on the national political stage. An African American in a party desparate to make inroads with minorities, Carson is also a neurosurgeon without the burden of a political background. He has become a favorite in the conservative media. He’s also the only potential 2016 candidate to have a movie made about his medical career. Cuba Gooding, Jr., played Carson. But as a fierce critic of Obamacare, Carson has also waded into controversy. He once compared the health care law to slavery and drawn parallels between the U.S. and Nazi Germany. ’s Mark Preston made this short bio video with our digital video team earlier this year: Carson debated Wolf Blitzer about that Nazi Germany comment back in December: Meanwhile, out in the halls of the conference, some of the more interesting characters of the conservative movement had on their American flag pants: Carson suggests stripping the president of his golf game: Packed room listening to Ben Carson.

READ: D.C. legalizes pot, ignoring House Republicans “I think that we have to separate out legalization – there’s a lot of concern about drug abuse of any sort by our children and the general population – versus the heavy criminalization of non-violent drug offenses,” Obama said. “And I think that a lot of states are taking a look to see, do we have proportionality in terms of how we are penalizing the recreational user.” He said the United States has managed to discourage the use of other harmful products like tobacco without stiff jail sentences. “I think that’s what every state across the country, including some very conservative states that don’t have a lot of tolerance for marijuana, are looking at,” Obama said, “is do we want to be throwing people in jail for five, 10, 15 years if they’re not major drug dealers but they’re using a substance that’s probably not good for them but is probably not hurting too many other people?” Obama also repeated his previous stances on the Keystone XL pipeline, which he recently vetoed after Republicans sought to authorize it before the State Department completes a six-year-old review, and international trade. He touted his administration’s push for a 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership as a way to correct the labor and environmental lapses of past pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement.

        "articles": "The FBI rejected a recent White House request to publicly knock down media reports about communications between Donald Trump’s associates and Russians known to US intelligence during the 2016 presidential campaign, multiple US officials briefed on the matter tell . But a White House official said late Thursday that the request was only made after the FBI indicated to the White House it did not believe the reporting to be accurate. White House officials had sought the help of the bureau and other agencies investigating the Russia matter to say that the reports were wrong and that there had been no contacts, the officials said. The reports of the contacts were first published by The New York Times and  on February 14. The direct communications between the White House and the FBI were unusual because of decade-old restrictions on such contacts. Such a request from the White House is a violation of procedures that limit communications with the FBI on pending investigations. Late Thursday night, White House press secretary Sean Spicer objected to ’s characterization of the White House request to the FBI. “We didn’t try to knock the story down. We asked them to tell the truth,” Spicer said. The FBI declined to comment for this story. Trump aides were in constant touch with senior Russian officials during campaign The discussions between the White House and the bureau began with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on the sidelines of a separate White House meeting the day after the stories were published, according to a US law enforcement official. The White House initially disputed that account, saying that McCabe called Priebus early that morning and said The New York Times story vastly overstates what the FBI knows about the contacts. But a White House official later corrected their version of events to confirm what the law enforcement official described. The same White House official said that Priebus later reached out again to McCabe and to FBI Director James Comey asking for the FBI to at least talk to reporters on background to dispute the stories. A law enforcement official says McCabe didn’t discuss aspects of the case but wouldn’t say exactly what McCabe told Priebus. Comey rejected the request for the FBI to comment on the stories, according to sources, because the alleged communications between Trump associates and Russians known to US intelligence are the subject of an ongoing investigation. The White House did issue its own denial, with Priebus calling The New York Times story “complete garbage.” “The New York Times put out an article with no direct sources that said that the Trump campaign had constant contacts with Russian spies, basically, you know, some treasonous type of accusations. We have now all kinds of people looking into this. I can assure you and I have been approved to say this – that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me that that story is not only inaccurate, but it’s grossly overstated and it was wrong. And there’s nothing to it,” Preibus said on “Fox News Sunday” last weekend.  has previously reported that there was constant communication between high-level advisers to then-candidate Trump, Russian officials and other Russians known to US intelligence during the summer of 2016. Several members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees tell  that the congressional investigations are continuing into those alleged Russian contacts with the Trump campaign, despite Priebus’ assertion that there is nothing to those reports. It is uncertain what the committees will eventually find and whether any of the information will ever be declassified and publicly released. But the push to investigate further shows that Capitol Hill is digging deeper into areas that may not be comfortable for the White House. The Trump administration’s efforts to press Comey run contrary to Justice Department procedure memos issued in 2007 and 2009 that limit direct communications on pending investigations between the White House and the FBI. “Initial communications between the [Justice] Department and the White House concerning pending or contemplated criminal investigations or cases will involve only the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, from the side of the Department, and the Counsel to the President, the Principal Deputy Counsel to the President, the President, or the Vice President from the side of the White House,” reads the 2009 memo. The memos say the communication should only happen when it is important for the President’s duties and where appropriate from a law enforcement perspective. A Department of Justice spokesman said Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reviewing the memos and that “the Department is following the guidelines in its communications with the White House.” The effort to refute the  and New York Times stories came as increasing numbers of congressional members were voicing concern about Russia’s efforts to influence individuals with ties to Trump. On February 17, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held a briefing with Comey. It’s unclear what was said, but senators suggested there was new information discussed about Russia. “Every briefing we go through we gain new information,” said Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, a member of the committee. Lankford declined to be more specific about the briefing. Sen. Angus King of Maine also declined to reveal what was discussed during the Comey briefing. In response to a question on Priebus’ strong denial of the claims, King said he was “surprised” that Priebus would be “that categorical.” Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the goal of his panel’s inquiry is to follow “leads wherever they go even if they may be uncomfortable to Republicans.” “The American public will want to know if the President had personal or financial ties to the Russian government,” Swalwell said.

        "articles": "Jonathan Tasini: Bernie Sanders' story is powerful appeal to working class voters New polls show Sanders is a stronger candidate than Clinton against Trump, he says Editor’s Note: Jonathan Tasini (@jonathantasini) has been a frequent commentator on  and is a Bernie Sanders supporter. He challenged Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Senate primary in New York in 2006. He is the author of several books, president of the Economic Future Group and the publisher/editor of Working Life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Many observers may scratch their heads wondering how a crass billionaire can make inroads with working-class voters, but their confusion misses a critical point: The political revolt that benefited Donald Trump is not limited to the Republican Party, but is also in full fury inside the Democratic Party. Democrats, by embracing in the 1990s a series of bipartisan policies geared toward corporations at the expense of American jobs, have since failed to adequately defend America’s working class, and those voters are making their presence felt at the ballot box as a result. Recent polls show the frustrations they feel toward the Democrats pose a real danger in the race for the White House, depending on who ends up winning the nomination. Quinnipiac found a battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to be an essential tossup in three key swing states: Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. Meanwhile, in West Virginia, 53% of Democratic voters said global trade deals take jobs away from American workers. Establishment Democrats are trying to wave off a recurring theme in poll after poll, including the Quinnipiac numbers and Tuesday night’s primary results: Bernie Sanders is a much stronger general election candidate versus Trump. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday even showed Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton running nearly neck-and-neck nationally. Leaving aside Florida (which has been closely contested in recent presidential elections), the three other states tell an important story. Since the mid-1990s, a broad swath of American workers has felt shut out of every debate over economic recession or recovery. Particularly for those workers who once had unionized, middle-class jobs with solid benefits, finding decent-paying jobs has been a bust. According to Public Citizen’s analysis of official government statistics since 1994, both Ohio and Pennsylvania have lost over 300,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs each. That same time period coincides with the passage and implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the creation in 1995 of the World Trade Organization. Both were championed by Bill Clinton, and his Labor Secretary Robert Reich, and endorsed by both parties. These so-called “free trade” deals have one common thread: They set up rules benefiting corporate rights, particularly the protection of capital and patents, at the expense of wages for workers. During the 1990s, President Clinton also urged many Democrats to support other corporate-friendly measures: deregulation of the financial industry (which arguably set the stage for the recent financial crisis), welfare reform (which ripped away a safety net for millions) and tax cuts for the wealthy that exacerbated the divide between rich and poor. Enjoy getting your high cable bills every month? You can thank the Clinton administration’s 1996 deregulation of telecommunications, which ushered in a wave of anti-consumer mergers. Indeed, the much-ballyhooed Clinton economic “miracle” was significantly built on a credit bubble, not robust or sustainable wage growth. Today’s rejoinders to criticism of these policies from many establishment Democrats underscore how tone deaf the party elites have become. They claim that things would be a lot worse if Republicans had been running the show. Without a doubt, I believe that to some extent, that is true. However, “Hey, vote for us because we’re not as bad as the other guys” is a lackluster slogan — a wheezing plea that lacks credibility for many voters who have been ignored for decades. Democrats’ longtime backing for corporate-friendly policies has, unsurprisingly, created fertile ground for the appeal of a huckster who pledges to “make America great again.” Many voters are flocking to Trump not based on a complete list of specific policies they dislike on the left or support on the right. They just see a tidal wave of mounting debt, no hopes for a good job and, by contrast, the game they’re losing being rigged in favor of a tiny group of people. Working-class voters have a sometimes inchoate sense the political establishment – anyone with experience serving in public office — has abandoned them to suffer while aligning themselves with forces many people can describe only vaguely as “Washington.” Trump, who is schooled in the ability to sell anything and has a finely attuned ear to people’s wounds and desires, can promise in grand terms to heal their hurt — even if he has no intention of doing so. With Hillary Clinton’s record-high negatives in the area of trust and honesty — exceeded only, to her good luck, by Trump’s even higher negatives on those attributes — she will struggle to convince these voters that she feels their pain. She’ll gain some traction thanks to Trump’s sexism and the Republicans’ relentless assaults on her. But the fact remains that she, like her husband did, has advocated the bipartisan policies that have hurt working Americans and she represents the very establishment people are aching to kick to the curb. By contrast, Sanders’ authenticity and his consistent opposition to the policies people feel, in their gut, have hurt them continues to resonate. Indeed, in the wake of Sanders’ victory in West Virginia, even New Hampshire state Sen. Lou D’Allesandro, a Clinton supporter, told the Wall Street Journal: “Every time [Mr. Sanders] presents himself and presents his story, more people start talking about him.” 5 takeaways from West Virginia and Nebraska People talk — and voters turn out — because Bernie Sanders’ story is powerful. It describes, truthfully, what has happened to the working class in America. As a result, he is winning the debate about what the party should stand for — forcing a moderate, corporate-funded Democrat like Hillary Clinton to mimic his rhetoric and agenda. As we move into the final phase of primary season, we will soon know whether the party will also field the stronger opponent to the snake oil Donald Trump is selling.

Trump had claimed the matter was a ‘massive story.’” The second, broken by The Washington Post, reveals that the FBI obtained a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court court warrant in August 2016 aimed at monitoring the communications of one-time Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page. The key paragraph: “The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page’s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.” Scroll up. Read that one again. It’s a “wow.” Page has denied any wrongdoing. What’s become clear over the first few months of the Trump White House is that we aren’t in the midst of a “he said-she said” when it comes to the campaign’s ties to Russia. It’s more of a “he alleged-he said, he said, she said, he said, he said” sort of situation. As in, on the one hand, we have Trump asserting that the whole story of Russia’s attempts to influence the election via connections within his campaign apparatus is “fake news,” and grasping at the idea that somehow, some way he will be eventually proven right in his baseless claims that then-President Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower. On the other, we have FBI Director James Comey, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the heads of both the House and Senate intelligence committees – both Republicans – and lots and lots of other prominent voices within the intelligence community insisting the Russian investigation is entirely justified and that no evidence exists for Trump’s claims. It’s not a fair fight – and shouldn’t be presented as one. And that has zero to do with partisanship and everything to do with the facts as we know them. The best path forward for President Trump as it relates to Russia is to pivot from his current this-is-all-fake-news stance to one in which he embraces both the congressional and Justice Department investigations into the Russian meddling into the election. Given the amount of smoke surrounding Trump’s campaign and Russia, it’s no longer really a question whether it merits an investigation into whether there’s some fire at its center. Simply because that’s the path Trump should take, of course, doesn’t mean it’s the one he will choose. In fact, for someone who prides himself on zigging when everyone thinks he should zag, Trump likely won’t follow this path. But all that ensures is that the Russia story will just keep getting worse for him and his administration. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

        "articles": "Everything you need to know about bitcoin, blockchain, NFTs and more Correction: A previous version of this article misidentified one of the shootings connected to 8chan. 8chan, the internet message board notorious for serving as a home to racist and misogynist content, was struggling to get back online Monday in the wake of what authorities believe was its use by the suspected gunman in the El Paso shooting to post a white nationalist manifesto. 8chan originally went offline after internet infrastructure company Cloudflare stopped providing support for it early Monday morning. The administrators of the message board found other service providers to get back online, including the hosting company Epik. Epik, in turn, was relying on the services of Voxility, another internet company. But Voxility pulled the plug on Epik after it was made aware that its services were being used to keep 8chan online. “We do not tolerate hate speech. This is a firm stand from our team and we count on the support of our community online and via social media platforms in keeping the internet a safer place,” Maria Sirbu, Voxility’s vice president of business development, told  Business in an email. As of Monday afternoon, 8chan was largely offline. While Epik is already hosting 8chan, a representative for the company told  Business that Epik would assess in the coming days whether to provide additional services to the message board that would help keep it online, including the protection from online attacks that Cloudflare had been providing the site. “Freedom of speech and expression are fundamental rights in a free society. We enter into a slippery slope when we start to limit speech that makes us uncomfortable,” the Epik representative said. “The censorship we’ve seen across major social media platforms as of late has created a vacuum. Our services fill the ever growing need for a neutral service provider that will not arbitrarily terminate accounts based on social or political pressure. … Ultimately, we believe that “sunlight is the best disinfectant” and that exposing hateful ideas is necessary if they are to be defeated. However this must absolutely occur within the bounds of the law.” 8chan’s problems began Sunday evening, when Cloudflare announced it would reverse its stance on hosting the site. “We just sent notice that we are terminating 8chan as a customer effective at midnight tonight Pacific Time. The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths. Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit,” Matthew Prince, Cloudflare’s CEO, wrote in a blog post. The announcement was an about-face after Cloudflare told  earlier Sunday that it had no plans to stop providing its services to 8chan. The company had said it has been in contact with law enforcement about Saturday’s mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, where the suspect is believed to have posted what police describe as a manifesto on 8chan minutes before the attack. People accused of a synagogue shooting in Poway, California, and shootings at two mosques in New Zealand also reportedly announced their plans on 8chan. “We continue to feel incredibly uncomfortable about playing the role of content arbiter and do not plan to exercise it often,” Prince said in the post. While 8chan has been offline since roughly midnight PST, it’s possible the site may be able to get back online using a different internet services provider. A message posted on the website’s official Twitter account said “there might be some downtime in the next 24-48 hours while we find a solution.” Cloudflare provides cybersecurity and other services to websites that help them to stay online. In 2017, Cloudflare pulled its services from The Daily Stormer, a Neo-Nazi website. Douglas Kramer, Cloudflare general counsel and a former lawyer in President Barack Obama’s White House, told  Business on Sunday that the company does not believe it should have the power to unilaterally decide what can and cannot stay on the internet. The company isn’t legally required to provide its services to any website, regardless of content. Kramer said Cloudflare complies with requests from law enforcement agencies and from courts relating to websites that are involved in child pornography and other illegal activity. El Paso mass shooting is at least the third atrocity linked to 8chan this year He said Cloudflare would comply with a request relating to 8chan if such a request were made, but the company would “want to see something from law enforcement or a regulator agency or a court that says, ‘We have made this decision after going through due process.’” Kramer said while there are laws, regulations and processes in place for pulling online support services from websites like those used for child pornography, lawmakers and regulators have been less active in creating processes for sites like 8chan. After the company stopped working with The Daily Stormer in 2017, Prince questioned his own decision. “You win a lot of points for firing Nazis from using your service,” Prince told  at the time. “But it sets a dangerous precedent when a company that most of your viewers have never heard of is effectively deciding what can and cannot be on the internet.” “Without a clear framework as a guide for content regulation, a small number of companies will largely determine what can and cannot be online,” Prince wrote in a blog post at the time. Cloudflare even posted a list of criticisms about its decision to its website. Cloudflare sees itself as fundamentally different to services like Facebook, Kramer told , because it is not involved in surfacing or moderating content. The El Paso shooter faces the death penalty in a 'domestic terrorism' case “We really don’t have anything to do with content,” Kramer said. “We see bits moving around the internet and we are one of the groups that make sure those bits move safely and securely.” “Facebook sits up at the surface of the internet, forming communities, moderating those communities, figuring out what people want to see next,” he said. “We recognize the tragedy of the two incidents that happened yesterday,” Kramer said, adding that Cloudflare was continuing to monitor the situation. Fredrick Brennan, who created of 8chan, told  on Sunday that the site’s current administrators “are running it in a way that is indefensible.” “If it’s going to keep on like this it should be shut down,” he said. “I don’t want to pile on but they are not doing anything to solve this. They should at least shut down the board for a week or a month after something like this. They are letting their users incite violence.” He later tweeted a thank you to Cloudflare after the company announced its decision. “Finally this nightmare might have an end. I just want to go back to making my fonts in peace and not have to worry about getting phone calls from /New York Times every time a mass shooting happens,” he tweeted.

        "articles": "Do Not Sell Moody's Analytics estimates that if the Democratic presidential nominee's proposals are enacted, the economy would create 10.4 million jobs during her presidency, or 3.2 million more than expected under current law. The pace of GDP growth would also accelerate to an annual average of 2.7%, from the current forecast of 2.3%. \"The upshot of our analysis is that Secretary Clinton's economic policies when taken together will result in a stronger U.S. economy under almost any scenario,\" Moody's writes in its report. Moody's Analytics is an independent research group, but the lead author of the report on Clinton is Mark Zandi, who donated $2,700 to her campaign last year, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Zandi was a vocal supporter of the stimulus package President Obama deployed during the financial crisis of 2009, but he has also served as an economic adviser to former Republican presidential candidate John McCain. Related: Trump supporters feel worse off than Clinton fans Moody's published a similar analysis of Donald Trump's plans in June. It concluded that the Republican presidential nominee's policies would result in an economic downturn that would last longer than the Great Recession. About 3.5 million Americans would lose their jobs, unemployment would jump to 7% and home prices would fall. The reports are based on a forecasting model similar to those used by the Federal Reserve and Congressional Budget Office. Moody's found that several of Clinton's key policies would boost the economy: Her immigration proposal would increase the number of skilled workers in the country, more government spending on infrastructure would help business productivity, and her paid family leave proposal would bring more people into the workforce. Related: Why Trump isn't scaring the stock market Other Clinton proposals would have a more complicated effect. Gradually hiking the minimum wage to $12 would reduce employment by 650,000 as businesses chose to hire fewer low-wage employees. However, pay would rise substantially for workers that kept their jobs. \"Evident from her proposals is the belief that the country needs to invest more in education, infrastructure and workers, and that the well-to-do, and to a lesser degree financial institutions and businesses, should pay for it,\" Moody's said. \"While her budget arithmetic does not completely add up, it is pretty close, and the nation's debt load under her plan is no different than under current law,\" the group continued. The team at Moody's also ran the numbers on what would happen if Clinton could only get some of her policies through Congress. This \"Clinton Lite\" option still produces stronger growth in GDP and jobs than current law, but the gains aren't as impressive. In a third scenario, under which Clinton is elected but congressional opposition prevents her plans from being implemented, the economy's performance is similar to what is expected under current law. -- Heather Long and Cristina Alesci contributed reporting.

        "articles": "A family’s SUV found at the bottom of a California cliff last week may have been deliberately driven off the road, police told media Sunday. The bodies of Jennifer and Sarah Hart, both 38, were discovered inside their overturned SUV near a remote stretch of Highway 1 in Northern California last Monday. Emergency responders found the bodies of three of their six children – Markis, 19, and Jeremiah and Abigail, both 14 – outside the car, which landed upside down on the rocky shoreline below the cliff. Their other children – Hannah, 16, Devonte, 15, and Sierra, 12 – are missing. Nobody reported seeing the crash, so authorities don’t know exactly when or how it happened and it is unclear whether the three missing children were in the SUV when it fell 100 feet into the sea. Family's SUV goes over a cliff, leaving authorities seeking 3 children and clues to what happened Police said that preliminary information suggested the car may have been intentionally driven straight off the edge of the cliff. Data from the vehicle’s air bag module and software indicated that the car had stopped at the pull out and then accelerated off the road, said Greg Baarts, acting assistant chief of the California Highway Patrol’s Northern Division. “At this point in our investigation, that is the direction we are going,” Baarts said. Preliminary data from the car suggested that there had been approximately 70 feet of continuous acceleration from the last moment the brakes were applied before the SUV went over and hit the ocean floor, Baarts said. There was no evidence to suggest the car had been driving at an angle when it left the road, he said. The SUV’s speedometer was “pinned” at 90 miles per hour, Baarts said, although he clarified that this was preliminary information and did not mean the vehicle was going that fast. “The most likely cause of that reading is the shock from the impact,” he said, adding that when a vehicle collides with something, the speedometer will lock at a certain speed. That alone cannot be used to determine how fast the vehicle was going. Baarts said that “in this vehicle the speedometer is electronically controlled,” which could have caused an electrical charge to give that reading, or it could have been unintentionally manipulated during the recovery efforts. Baarts stressed that investigators were still verifying the information, but that authorities believed that a felony had been committed in the crash. He denied rumors that a suicide note had been found at the Harts’ Washington house but said investigators were still evaluating some items found at the residence and said there had been some red flags raised. Deputies from the Clark County Sheriff’s Office in Washington executed a search warrant Thursday night at the family’s home in Woodland, looking for any evidence in the missing persons case, Sgt. Brent Waddell told media late last week. He said the office was working with California authorities to find the missing children. Police have said conditions at the house indicated that any trip would have been temporary. The Harts’ neighbor, Bruce DeKalb, said the family moved in about 10 months ago and was “very private.” DeKalb told HLN last Thursday that Devonte and one of his sisters had said they were not being properly treated. Devonte, who is black, earned national attention when a photo of him at age 12 went viral. In the image, tears stream down his face as he embraces a white officer in the middle of a demonstration in Portland, Oregon, related to the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Devonte had been holding a sign offering “Free Hugs.” DeKalb said that he had called Child Protective Services March 23 and they had arrived at the house just after Jennifer Hart came home from work but that she didn’t answer the door. Sarah Hart came home not long afterward, DeKalb said, and by Saturday morning the family and their vehicle were gone. After the Friday visit, Child Protective Services tried to visit the family twice more, on Monday and Tuesday, to no avail, according to the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services. The agency was trying to get in touch after the “now deceased children were identified as potential victims of alleged abuse or neglect,” according to a statement from the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services. The department said it had no history with the family. Before the Harts moved to Washington, they had lived in Minnesota, where Sarah Hart pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic assault involving one of the children in 2010, according to court records from Douglas County. Friends of the Harts had a different view of the couple, describing them to  affiliate KOIN as loving parents who gave the kids everything they had and radiated positivity. “Jen and Sarah really were the kind of parents that I think the world desperately needs,” friend Zippy Lomax told KOIN. ’s Melissa Gray contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Prince never formally worked for Trump either during or after the 2016 campaign He has maintained close ties to the Trump orbit and acted as an informal adviser on foreign policy matters The House Intelligence Committee is set to meet Blackwater founder Erik Prince on Thursday for a closed-door interview that could shed light on one of the enduring questions of the Russia investigation. His interview is designated as an “open hearing in a closed space,” which means it will be conducted privately but the committee will later release a public transcript, likely with some redaction. While Prince never formally worked for President Donald Trump either during or after the 2016 campaign, he has maintained close ties to the Trump orbit and has acted as an informal adviser on foreign policy matters. Donald Trump Jr. to talk to House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors Prince is one of at least 12 Trump associates who had contacts with Russians during the campaign or transition. His role in the Russia investigation centers on a secret meeting in the Seychelles, a remote island chain in the Indian Ocean, with a Russian businessman tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some key questions remain unanswered eight months after the meeting was first reported in the press. Lawmakers will likely ask about his communication with the Trump team about the meeting. The White House has said that it was “not aware” of any meeting between Prince and the Russians. A spokesman for Prince separately said that “the meeting had nothing to do with President Trump.” The Seychelles meeting happened after a complex series of events thousands of miles away. In early December 2016, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who’s now a senior White House adviser, and Michael Flynn, who later served briefly as Trump’s national security adviser, met at Trump Tower with then-Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Kushner acknowledged this meeting in his testimony at the Senate Intelligence Committee in July. Kushner testified that the meeting attendees unsuccessfully explored options to open a secure communication channel with Russian military officials to discuss Syria. The Washington Post reported that it got a letter from an anonymous but credible source that said the gathering also included talk of arranging a meeting between a Trump representative and a Russian contact in a third country. Top White House lawyer prepares for questioning in Russia probe Later in December, Flynn, Kushner and Steve Bannon, who was the campaign’s chief executive and until August the chief strategist in the White House, met at Trump Tower with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. The United Arab Emirates never told the Obama administration that Zayed would be visiting New York, even though it is customary for foreign dignitaries to inform the US government about their travels. A classified intelligence report was written about the meeting and Susan Rice, then-President Barack Obama’s national security adviser at the time, requested that the names of the Americans mentioned in the report be revealed,  reported. The Americans ended up being senior Trump officials, though it’s unclear exactly which Trump officials were named. Officials from both parties say that this procedure, known colloquially as unmasking, is legal and is commonly done by top US intelligence officials. After that meeting, Prince approached Zayed and said he had authorization to act as an informal emissary for Trump, according to the Washington Post. Zayed then arranged the meeting. Hope Hicks: A witness to Trump's rise In mid-January 2017, Prince met the Russian businessman in the Seychelles.  previously reported that Prince met a close Putin ally. Prince’s closed-door interview on Capitol Hill will be his first chance under oath to confirm the identity of the Russian he met.  reported that the purpose of the meeting, held weeks before Trump’s inauguration, was to arrange a possible backchannel of communication between the Kremlin and the incoming administration. The Washington Post reported that the meeting was also about an effort to curtail Iran’s influence. Prince told ’s Erin Burnett in August that he doesn’t remember the name of the Russian businessman but that he was “some fund manager.” Prince said the meeting was solely about his personal business dealings and that the conversation “probably lasted as long as one beer.” He denies any wrongdoing and strongly denies that anyone on Trump’s team asked him to take the meeting. Prince never officially worked for the Trump campaign, transition or administration, but he was a prominent Trump supporter during the campaign, spent time around the transition office and has continued informally advising the Trump White House on some major foreign policy decisions.  reported that Prince met with Trump and Flynn during the campaign. He was also a major donor: Records from the Federal Election Commission indicate that Prince donated $250,000 to pro-Trump efforts last year. The FEC records, while sometimes imperfect, match Prince’s name and address. In the months before the election, Prince regularly went on Bannon’s radio show to promote Trump’s candidacy and occasionally spread conspiracy theories about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Bannon hosted the radio program, Breitbart News Daily, before joining the Trump campaign. Bharara: 'Substantial likelihood' Flynn lawyers are in discussions on cooperating in Mueller probe “John Podesta’s emails, I can assure you, did not come from the Russians,” Prince said in October 2016, referring to Clinton’s campaign chairman, whose personal emails were released by WikiLeaks. “This idea that the left, and even the administration, even some in the intelligence community, are now claiming it’s all the Russians is entirely too cute and very, very thin on any kind of fact or legitimacy.” The US intelligence community later announced that Russia was responsible for the Podesta hacks and had transferred the information to WikiLeaks as part of its plan to interfere in the 2016 election. Prince attended the victory party at Trump Tower on election night, Bloomberg reported. During the transition, Prince met with members of Trump’s incoming national security team,  has reported. He was also spotted riding the Amtrak and discussing policy with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and someone who now works on the National Security Council, according to Bloomberg. During the transition, Prince boasted about his influence in the Trump orbit,  reported. Around that same time, Trump appointed Prince’s older sister Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education. More recently, he was recruited by Bannon and Kushner over the summer to help the administration devise a new Afghanistan strategy, according to The New York Times. He proposed replacing US troops with private military contractors – like the fighters employed by his former company, Blackwater, which is now known as Academi. His ideas were met with heavy skepticism at the Pentagon and Trump did not embrace the plan. Prince may also be eyeing a future in politics, as the former Navy SEAL said in October that he was considering a potential US Senate bid in Wyoming. Bannon has expressed interest in persuading Prince to challenge Republican Sen. John Barrasso, according to a source familiar with Bannon’s thinking. “I am a Wyoming resident,” he told  in October. “I’ve had a home there for 25 years, was a resident of Wyoming for many years, already back when I was on the SEAL team. It is an option I’m looking at.” © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.  Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.",

Linda McMahon, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, made the $1 million donation to a super PAC funded by the Ricketts family and casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson in early October, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission late Thursday. The super PAC, Future 45, was revitalized as a pro-Trump committee in early fall by the Ricketts, who earlier in the election support anti-Trump efforts, and by Adelson, who sat out the Republican primary. One of the Ricketts siblings, Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, has been named by Trump as deputy commerce secretary. Linda McMahon picked to lead SBA McMahon’s most recent donation brings her total contributions to pro-Trump super PACs this election to $7 million, making her one of the largest contributors in support of Trump. She had previously given $6 million in August and September to Rebuilding America Now, another super PAC that supported Trump’s campaign. Super PACs are a type of campaign committee that are allowed to raise unlimited sums of money from Americans for political purposes, provided they do not directly coordinate with official candidate campaigns. The WWE co-founder was named this week to serve as the chief of the SBA. She started the pro wrestling franchise with her husband, Vince McMahon, but stepped down from her role in the company in 2009.

        "articles": "() Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, publicly rejected former President Donald Trump's most recent false charge that he would've won the 2020 election if not for \"fraudulent\" votes, her latest rebuke of the former president that has put her at odds with many members of her own party. Cheney has repeatedly pushed back on Trump's baseless assertions that there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. She was one of only 10 Republicans to vote to impeach the former president for \"incitement of insurrection\" after the deadly riot at the Capitol on January 6. \"The 2020 presidential election was not stolen,\" Cheney tweeted on Monday. \"Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system.\" Cheney's remarks were in response to Trump, who said in a written statement on Monday, \"The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!\" Cheney's outspoken criticism of Trump has led to some House Republicans to accuse her of dividing the conference and distracting from the party's goals. Some have recently warned that Cheney could face a vote to oust her from her spot in the House Republican in leadership, although Cheney survived a similar test earlier this year. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy has the power to call for that vote, but it's unclear if he will do that as soon as next week, according to multiple House GOP sources. But multiple Republican lawmakers and aides say that Cheney is on very shaky ground internally and whether she can hang on to her post in a secret-ballot election is highly uncertain. When Cheney easily survived a bid to oust her in February, McCarthy came to her defense and called on the House GOP Conference to keep her in the spot in a speech delivered behind closed doors. This time, however, could be different. A House GOP source who has been in contact with McCarthy said the GOP leader has been \"furious\" at her for weeks amid her comments about Trump. A House Republican lawmaker, who voted to keep Cheney in her post in February, said after speaking with many of his colleagues, it's clear that Cheney has \"less (support) than she thinks\" within the House GOP conference. If Cheney were to be ousted, it's unknown who would replace her. There are several Republicans viewed as potential candidates for the No. 3 job, including Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana. Banks, who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee, told  he hopes \"we can avoid\" a vote to oust Cheney. But he made clear his displeasure with her. \"I would like to see my friend Liz join the focus and share the mission to regain the majority,\" said Banks. \"She seems very, very focused on the past and tearing down other Republicans like myself,\" Banks added, referring in part to her criticism of a memo he authored to take back the House majority. The conference meets in full for the first time next week. At that point, McCarthy can call for a vote if he chooses to do so. If McCarthy doesn't go that route, then there are special procedures in place to ultimately force another vote, but those steps can take weeks to play out. In January, a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol in a deluded effort to overturn the 2020 election as Congress certified the vote. While nearly the entire House GOP conference voted to acquit Trump in the impeachment trial, Cheney blamed the riot -- and the death of five people -- directly on him, saying he \"summoned,\" \"assembled\" and \"lit the flame of this attack.\" \"There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,\" Cheney said. Cheney's vote to impeach Trump sparked a backlash among the House Republican conference and in Wyoming, which Trump won in 2020 with nearly 70% of the vote, the most of any state in the country. Cheney has also faced criticism after leaning in to greet President Joe Biden last week, as he made his way down the aisle for his speech to a joint session of Congress. But Cheney appears to be uninterested in backing away from her views, despite the intraparty pressure in Washington and primary challengers lining up to take her on in Wyoming. Cheney has recently opened the door to running for president in 2024 and blasted colleagues in the Senate who supported efforts to challenge the election results on January 6. In February, Cheney overwhelmingly kept her leadership position in a secret ballot vote 145-61 -- but some Republicans have grown increasingly irritated that she continues to publicly attack Trump. Last week, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy was asked if Cheney was still a good fit for leadership. He declined to endorse her, instead saying Cheney's future would be determined by the conference.

        "articles": "Conservative calls to roll back Obamacare's Medicaid expansion are gaining traction Such a move, however, could blow up the already fragile efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act The White House is privately lining up behind conservative calls to roll back Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion sooner than the health care reform bill currently calls for, two senior administration officials and a senior House conservative aide told  on Thursday. Nobody wants their name on the Republican health care bill White House officials are beginning to urge House GOP leadership to include an earlier sunset of the Medicaid expansion funds authorized under Obamacare than the 2020 date set by the current bill. The change comes just days after the bill was unveiled and follows a blitz of activism aimed squarely at the White House and President Donald Trump, who has met with conservative leaders in recent days. Such a move, however, could blow up the already fragile efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Ending the Medicaid expansion sooner could complicate prospects for the bill in the Senate. And it would likely infuriate Republican governors in states that accepted federal funds for the expansion, who face the prospect of many people losing coverage they gained under Obamacare. After 27-hour debate, second House committee OKs Obamacare repeal House Speaker Paul Ryan’s office declined to comment. But a GOP congressional aide wasn’t happy. “This could kill the bill in the Senate and make it even more complicated in the House,” the aide said. The White House movement comes as the Republican Study Committee, a group of House conservatives, endorsed two amendments aimed squarely at the Medicaid provisions, though it was not immediately clear if those were the proposals the White House would support. “We are a ‘yes’ if we get both of them. We’re ‘lean yes’ if we get one of them,” RSC Chairman Rep. Mark Walker told reporters Thursday. But when asked if they get none, Walker dodged and said they would still be focused on the process ahead. The White House has also signaled its tentative support for other measures being pushed by conservatives in private meetings, though the officials declined to elaborate on which provisions they are backing. “We’ve been pulling the bill to a more conservative place for a week plus,” one senior administration official said, adding the White House is more “in concert” with conservatives on Medicaid. Conservative Republican: Medicaid changes can win votes for health care bill Trump met with his budget director Mick Mulvaney and Reps. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan, two leaders of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of hardline conservatives opposed to the current bill. One senior administration official described the meeting as hugely influential in shifting the White House’s stance. Meadows declined to get into the substance of what was discussed at the meeting, but said he felt like progress was made when it comes to outlining conservatives’ concerns to Trump. “Whether ultimately he sides with some of the arguments that we’re making or not, I have nothing but really a heartfelt appreciation for the fact that he was willing to listen,” Meadows said. No deal was struck in the meeting, the North Carolina Republican said, but Trump is encouraging “good faith” talks between members of both chambers. When asked if he agrees with the analysis that Trump tends to tell people what they want to hear in private meetings, Meadows replied: “I didn’t say I was told what I wanted to hear, I said I had a good conversation with the President.” Jordan would not answer when asked whether the White House agreed to help push through the Medicaid change. “I thought it was a good meeting,” he said simply. Mulvaney was the founding member of the caucus and two senior administration officials cited his engagement with House conservatives as crucial to helping the White House and conservatives arrive at a consensus. Trump and other top White House officials have publicly called on conservatives to line up behind the bill, while saying they would be open to making some changes. They had not until now signaled which changes to the bill they would accept. Ryan on Thursday warned conservatives that “this is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare,” urging all Republicans to support the current bill. Paul Ryan’s TED talk ignores conservative split on GOP health care bill Paul Ryan's entire health care bill PowerPoint The move would gain the support of hardline conservatives, but could still doom the bill by losing a similar number of moderates in the House. One moderate Republican immediately said he knew of four other Republicans who would switch from “yes” to “no” if the bill ended the Medicaid expansion in 2017. And even if the altered version passed the House, it would face even dimmer chances than it does already in the Senate, where a sizable bloc of senators from states that expanded Medicaid are pushing the White House and the House to go in the opposite direction. A senior Republican aide said of the White House that this would deliberately undercut the process that the House is pursuing – a process the White House was both full looped in on “and in full agreement with after last weekend.” “They can be very helpful in this process, but this isn’t the way,” the aide said of the White House. “And they know that - or at least they should.” Speaking generally, a senior GOP source was uncomfortable with talk of changing the bill. “The more this thing is shaky, the more people can back away,” the source said. Asked if Trump should be more visible, the source said, “Absolutely.” Vice President Mike Pence, meanwhile, is signaling to abortion opponents the White House’s support for a measure to defund Planned Parenthood, days after Trump signaled he would be open to preserving funding for the group if it ended its abortion program. Planned Parenthood, a women’s health organization that receives about $500 million in federal funding, has rejected that offer, noting that taxpayer dollars already do not fund abortions. That too could rankle GOP senators like Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, who have opposed calls to tie Planned Parenthood to Obamacare repeal. Planned Parenthood rejects Trump proposal to stop abortion services But the White House was not backing sweeping changes to the GOP bill’s tax credits provision, which is crucial to the bill – and conservatives opposed to the plan are beginning to come to terms with that idea. “Everybody at this point now agrees tax credits are going to be part of this,” a top House conservative aide said. Trump to conservative leaders: If this plan fails, I'll blame Democrats The White House and conservatives opposed to the current bill are also getting more in sync after White House officials alleviated some conservative concerns by explaining that some measures they are calling for will be achieved in regulations Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price would implement through his administrative authority, a senior administration official said. Still, the official said that conservatives have made arriving at a consensus more difficult through their caustic rhetoric in recent days. “Some of the rhetoric has not been helpful,” the aide said. ’s Jeff Zeleny, Tom LoBianco, Phil Mattingly, Deirdre Walsh and Jim Acosta contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will answer questions during a live  town hall moderated by Jake Tapper, Thursday at 9 p.m. ET. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a scathing warning Thursday to a reporter who asked her a question about her feelings about President Donald Trump: “Don’t mess with me.” The California Democrat forcefully pushed back on the idea that she and her caucus are proceeding with articles of impeachment because of a personal dislike of Trump, after being asked by a reporter from Sinclair, James Rosen, if she hates him on her way out of the weekly press conference. Pelosi stopped and said: “I don’t hate anybody.” She then walked back to the microphone, and said that while she believes Trump is a “coward,” that’s only about his political positions. “I think this President is a coward when it comes to helping our kids who are afraid of gun violence,” she said. “I think that he is cruel when he doesn’t deal with helping our Dreamers, of which we are very proud of. I think he is in denial about the climate crisis. However, that’s about the election.” LIVE UPDATES: Pelosi asks House to proceed with articles of impeachment She continued: “This is about the Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the President’s violation of his oath of office. And as a Catholic, I resent your using the word ‘hate’ in a sentence that addresses me. I don’t hate anyone.” “I pray for the President all the time,” Pelosi said. “So don’t mess with me when it comes to words like that.” When asked about her comments at a  town hall later Thursday, Pelosi again invoked her Catholic faith to explain her response. “We were raised in the Catholic faith and the word ‘hate a person’ was just – that just didn’t happen,” she said. “The word ‘hate’ is a terrible word. … So for him to say that was really disgusting to me.” In a statement Thursday night, Sinclair spokesperson Ronn Torossian said the reporter meant “no disrespect” and that the organization does not “not dictate to our reporters what they can and cannot ask.” “We have reviewed the incident and based on the video, this was clearly not meant to be an inflammatory question and, further, this gave Speaker Pelosi the opportunity to clarify her own views, something that only strengthens positive dialogue,” Torossian said in the statement. “Again, both Sinclair and James Rosen respect Speaker Pelosi and hope we can continue the dialogue.” Pelosi is leading her caucus’ efforts to impeach Trump and the House Judiciary Committee announced Thursday its next impeachment hearing will be on Monday. During the press conference, Pelosi said Democrats won’t wait until courts make decisions about witness testimony before proceeding with articles of impeachment because the White House’s actions in taking these issues to court “is an obstruction of justice, and so we’re not going to be accomplices to his obstruction of justice.” Asked if the articles of impeachment should involve findings in the Mueller report, Pelosi demurred. “My chairmen will be making recommendations,” she said. “I’m not here to talk about that because that’s what they’ll be working on.” ’s Manu Raju asked if she is concerned about Democrats in moderate districts facing backlash from voters over the move. “This has absolutely nothing to do with politics. It isn’t about politics, partisanship, Democrats and Republicans. That’s totally insignificant,” said Pelosi. “It’s about the Constitution of the United States, the oath of office we take to protect and defend the constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. It’s about the President not honoring his oath of office. So no, I’m not concerned.” Pelosi also said impeachment is divisive and Democrats don’t take glee in the situation. She said it is heartbreaking, but Trump gave them no choice. “I’m really sorry the President made this necessary.” She added that the founding fathers couldn’t have predicted a “rogue Senate leader” who “will just ignore the facts and the Constitution,” referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.

Instead, the Democratic presidential hopeful said on Sunday he wants the United States to adopt a “Medicare-for-all” single-payer health care plan. “We need to join the rest of the industrialized world,” Sanders said on ABC’s “This Week.” Sen. Sanders:\"very positive reaction\" to SCOTUS ruling RELATED: Clinton weathers the summer of Sanders His comments illustrate Sanders’ appeal to Democrats’ liberal base, where his criticism that Obama’s health care law didn’t go far enough is just one of many areas he’s pushing the debate farther left. They also underscore the challenge facing the party’s frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, who is trying to navigate through a primary against Sanders without sacrificing her ability to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate. Meanwhile, Sanders’ commitment to liberals causes has caused him to gain on Clinton in recent polls. According to a new /WMUR New Hampshire Primary poll, Clinton holds just an 8-point edge over Sanders, with 43% behind Clinton and 35% backing Sanders. Sanders complained that the country is “spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.” “We are the only major country on earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people as a right and yet we end up spending much more than they do,” Sanders said. “So I do believe that we have to move toward a Medicare for all, single-payer system,” he said. “I think it’s not going to happen tomorrow, but that certainly should be the goal.” Conservative backlash against Obamacare, which critics said amounted in a government takeover of health care, led to Republicans winning back the House and Senate in recent elections.

        "articles": "A new biography of former Defense Secretary James Mattis reports President Donald Trump personally got involved in who would win a major $10 billion contract to provide cloud computing services to the Pentagon, according to the website Task & Purpose, which writes about military issues. That hotly contested contract was awarded to Microsoft on Friday evening over Amazon in a months-long battle. Task & Purpose reports the new book, “Holding The Line: Inside Trump’s Pentagon with Secretary Mattis” by former Mattis speechwriter and communications director Guy Snodgrass recounts that Mattis always tried to translate Trump’s demands into ethical outcomes. According to Snodgrass’ book, Trump called Mattis during summer 2018 and directed him to “screw Amazon” out of the opportunity to bid on the contract. Task & Purpose obtained an advanced copy of the book.  has not yet seen the book. For several years Trump has voiced his displeasure with Amazon and Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. He has accused Amazon of taking advantage of the Postal Service although independent investigations have disagreed with that contention. He also has linked his unfavorable view of Washington Post reporting to Amazon although the Post makes clear it is run separately. “Relaying the story to us during Small Group, Mattis said, ‘We’re not going to do that. This will be done by the book, both legally and ethically,’” Snodgrass wrote according to Task & Purpose. The White House did not immediately respond to a  request for comment. In response to the book and some of the other claims it contains, a spokeswoman for Mattis earlier this week released a statement saying Snodgrass was a “junior staffer” and “played no role in decision making.” Snodgrass has responded to those claims by showing a citation he received in which he said he played a vital and influential role in the Pentagon’s messaging. In a statement, Amazon said it is surprised at the decision. “(Amazon Web Services) is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion,” the statement read. “We remain deeply committed to continuing to innovate for the new digital battlefield where security, efficiency, resiliency, and scalability of resources can be the difference between success and failure.” In a statement, Microsoft pointed reporters to the Defense Department’s announcement. “We are working on this right now. In the meantime for more information see the DOD’s announcement,” the statement read. In July, Trump vowed that his administration would take a “strong look” at the Pentagon’s contract plan, saying that “some of the greatest companies in the world” had complained including IBM, Oracle and Microsoft. Oracle had pushed hard to scuttle Amazon’s effort, going so far as to develop a document alleging that officials inside and outside the Pentagon had conspired to help Amazon win.  reported in July that the document had made its way to Trump’s desk. Multiple independent reviews of the process found little evidence of wrongdoing, however. In a statement, the Defense Department’s Office of the Inspector General said investigators are close to completing their work reviewing the awarding of the contract. “To date, we have not found evidence that we believe would prevent the DoD from making a decision about the award of the contract,” said Dwrena Allen, spokesperson for the inspector general’s office. “We hope to have a completed report of our findings by the end of November, which we intend to release publicly, to the maximum extent possible.” ’s Jason Seher contributed to this story © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Mosque fires have occurred in Texas, Florida and Washington state After one mosque burned, a local Jewish leader shared the keys to his synagogue In just the first two months of the year, at least four mosques have gone up in flames as attacks against religious minorities have surged. Those fires follow “the worst year on record for incidents in which mosques were targets of bias,” according to the Council of American-Islamic Relations. CAIR documented 139 incidents of “damage/destruction/vandalism” at mosques last year – the most since record-keeping began in 2009. It does not track fires separately. “Islamophobic bias continues its trend toward increasing violence,” said Corey Saylor, director of CAIR’s Department to Monitor and Combat Islamophobia. The wave of hostility comes as President Donald Trump campaigned on – then enacted – a temporary ban on travelers from Muslim-majority countries entering the United States. He is said to be drafting a new version after the first was struck down in court. Here’s a look at the mosque fires so far this year: The Islamic Center of Lake Travis’ new mosque hadn’t even been completed yet when it mysteriously caught fire. Leaders said the center had suffered vandalism and graffiti in the past, but this fire was devastating. “You can imagine the emotions that we experienced upon seeing all our hard work, heartfelt efforts and dedication literally go up in flames,” the Islamic center posted in a statement. The damage, estimated at $370,000, was considered a complete loss, the Travis County Fire Marshal’s Office said. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. A fire that torched the Islamic Center of Eastside near Seattle was an act of arson, Bellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett said. No one was inside the mosque at the time of the blaze, which firefighters said shot 40-foot flames into the sky. Islamic Center of Eastside Rebuild -GoFundMe • someone burned down a Mosque in Bellevue WA. Donate to help rebuild  The police chief said Isaac Wayne Wilson has been charged with felony malicious mischief and was being investigated for arson. Police found the suspect lying on the ground near the back of the building,  affiliate KCPQ said. The mosque is asking for donations to rebuild. In recent months, backers of the fund-raising campaign said, “This center and a neighboring Islamic center have seen numerous acts of vandalism.” Fire rips through Houston mosque The fire that destroyed the Victoria Islamic Center mosque was intentionally set, the Houston office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives said. The ATF, CrimeStoppers and the mosque are offering a combined $30,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and indictment of whoever set the mosque on fire. While members of the mosque grappled with their loss, leaders of a local Jewish congregation stepped in to help – and gave them the keys to their synagogue so they could continue to worship. Fire at Florida mosque ruled arson A fire that damaged the Islamic Society of New Tampa has been ruled arson, Hillsborough County fire investigators said. Authorities have not ruled whether the fire was a hate crime, but Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said the attack “is no different than the wave of anti-Semitic attacks on Jewish community centers and synagogue and bomb threats that have been called in all across the country, including in Tampa over the recent months.” ’s Tony Marco, Ryan Rios and Joe Sterling contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "urls": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/12/politics/legal-immigration-public-charge/index.html",
        "articles": "The Trump administration released a regulation Monday that could dramatically cut the number of legal immigrants allowed to enter and stay in the US by making it easier to reject green card and visa applications. Paired with last week’s enforcement raids on food processing plants in Mississippi, Monday’s announcement amounts to a concerted effort by the administration to limit legal immigration and crack down on illegal immigration. The rule means many green card and visa applicants could be turned down if they have low incomes or little education, and have used benefits such as most forms of Medicaid, food stamps, and housing vouchers, because they’d be deemed more likely to need government assistance in the future. It will encourage “self-reliance and self-sufficiency for those seeking to come to or stay in the United States,” said acting US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli, appearing in the White House briefing room. In doing so, though, it’ll likely make it harder for low-income immigrants to come to the US. When asked about whether the rule is unfairly targeting low-income immigrants, Cuccinelli said: “We certainly expect people of any income to be able to stand on their own two feet, so if people are not able to be self-sufficient, than this negative factor is going to bear very heavily against them in a decision about whether they’ll be able to become a legal permanent resident. “ The 837-page rule applies to those seeking to come to or remain in the United States via legal channels and is expected to impact roughly 382,000 people seeking to adjust their immigration, according to the Department of Homeland Security. However, immigration advocates say millions of people could be affected by the regulation. Sweeping immigration changes proposed New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Monday evening that she plans to sue to block the rule. “President Trump’s new public charge rule is yet one more example of his Administration turning its back on people fighting to make a better life for them and their families,” James said in a statement. “Under this rule, children will go hungry; families will go without medical care. I am committed to defending all of New York’s communities, which is why I intend to sue the Trump Administration over this egregious rule.” Under current regulations put in place in 1996, the term “public charge” is defined as someone who is “primarily dependent” on government assistance, meaning it supplies more than half their income. But it only counted cash benefits, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or Supplemental Security Income from Social Security. Officials can take into account an applicant’s financial resources, health, education, skills, family status and age. But few people are rejected on these relatively narrow grounds, experts said. Immigrant advocates have argued that the rule goes beyond what Congress intended and would discriminate against those from poorer countries, keep families apart and prompt legal residents to forgo needed public aid, which could also impact their US citizen children. They also said it would penalize even hard-working immigrants who only need a small bit of temporary assistance from the government. “The rule reflects a dark vision of the United States – as an unwelcoming nation that wants to keep out people who seek to join their family, work hard, and climb the economic ladder – based on the erroneous assumption that they won’t contribute to our communities, our economy, and our nation,” said Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke immediately slammed the proposal Kamala Harris says Trump administration's move on green cards part of effort to 'vilify a whole group of people' “Legal. Undocumented. Refugee. Asylum Seeker. The distinctions don’t matter to President Trump. If you’re an immigrant, he believes you have no place in this country—even though, for 243 years, immigrants have made America the greatest nation the world has ever known,” the former Texas congressman tweeted. This regulation will have the “deepest, widest and most long term impact” of all of the immigration policies implemented by the Trump administration, said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center on Monday, adding that her organization and others are preparing to bring a lawsuit over the regulation. There are exceptions to the rule, such as benefits received by active duty member of the military, Medicaid for pregnant women, children under 21 years old, and emergency medical care. The rule also doesn’t impact refugees or asylum seekers. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump also issued a memorandum doubling down on a current law that requires immigrants’ sponsors to take financial responsibility for certain income-based government benefits the immigrant receives. It’s unclear whether enforcing the law would make any substantial difference. Undocumented immigrants would not be affected – unless an avenue opens up for them to apply for green cards or visas since they are largely ineligible for public aid. Monday’s regulation is likely to meet legal challenges, but it could still cause some who fear retribution to alter their daily lives. About one in seven adults in immigrant families reported that either the person or a family member did not participate in a non-cash safety net program last year because of fear of risking his or her green card status in the future, an Urban Institute study found. Among low-income immigrant families, the figure was more than one in five, according to the study, which was based on a December 2018 survey of nearly 2,000 non-elderly adults who are foreign born or live with at least one foreign-born family member. The rule includes immigrants who use one or more designated public benefits for 12 months within a 36-month period. Each benefit is counted separately, meaning if two benefits are used in a month, it’ll count as two months. The rule will take effect October 15.

        "articles": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in recent weeks in buying Greenland. That is not a sentence from an Onion article, although you could be forgiven if you made that mistake. This President, the most unorthodox resident of the White House in modern history, is actually, apparently, interested in buying Greenland – the world’s largest island currently owned by Denmark. This raises all sort of questions – like, literally, dozens – but I’ve boiled it down to five key ones, which I will now attempt to answer. It makes sense to get the big one out of the way first, right? Why would the US President want to purchase an island that is 80% covered by an ice sheet and where less than 60,000 people actually live? Trump himself hasn’t said – yet – but there are a few obvious reasons. The first is because Greenland is widely believed to be hugely rich in natural resources – including iron ore, lead, zinc, diamonds, gold, rare earth elements, uranium and oil. And much of it is currently untapped, due to the fact that, well, 80% of the country is covered by an ice sheet. But due to global warming, that ice sheet is melting rapidly – this summer NASA scientists observed two of the largest melts in the history of Greenland – and that erosion of the ice sheet is expected to make the mining of Greenland’s natural resources more doable. The second is for geopolitical reasons. The United States already has a foothold in the country – Thule Air Base – and, as The Wall Street Journal, which broke the Greenland purchase story, notes: “Located 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle, it includes a radar station that is part of a U.S. ballistic missile early-warning system. The base is also used by the U.S. Air Force Space Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command.” Third, Trump is a man very interested in his legacy in office. Buying Greenland would be a major bullet point on his presidential resume. Seems like no! “#Greenland is rich in valuable resources such as minerals, the purest water and ice, fish stocks, seafood, renewable energy and is a new frontier for adventure tourism,” tweeted the country’s government on Friday morning. “We’re open for business, not for sale.” Denmark owns Greenland, but the country has its own autonomous government. The country was granted home rule by the Danes in 1979 and in 2008 voted via referendum for even more autonomy from Denmark. Nope – despite what Twitter might make you think. The United States has actually pursued the purchase of Greenland before, according to a Danish historian named Tage Kaarsted. In 1946, US Secretary of State James Byrnes – serving under President Harry Truman – broached the idea with the Danish foreign minister at a United Nations meeting in New York. Nothing ever came of it. Almost 100 years before that, Secretary of State William Seward – fresh off the US’s purchase of Alaska – apparently looked into buying Greenland from the Danes. Um, no. One of the last times the United States bought land from a foreign country was in 1867, when Seward orchestrated the purchase of Alaska from the Russians for $7.2 million. It was heavily criticized at the time – and has gone down as “Seward’s Folly” in the history books. The US also purchased the Philippine islands from Spain in 1898 for $20 million and the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917 for $25 million. The most famous land acquisition by the United States came earlier – 1803 to be exact – when we agreed to the Louisiana Purchase with France. The US paid $15 million at the time for land that makes up almost one-quarter of America’s current territory. It goes like this: Greenland is actually icy and Iceland is actually green. And it’s generally true! Blame the Vikings for the names! The Point: Donald Trump has a lot of wild ideas as president. Buying Greenland may be one of the most unorthodox. But it’s also not one of his worst. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly state the history of US land purchases. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company.

        "articles": "President Barack Obama on Friday rejected the proposed Keystone XL pipeline The pipeline has been the focus of a seven-year political fight President Barack Obama on Friday rejected the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, ending the political fight over the Canada-to-Texas project that has gone on for much of his presidency. Secretary of State John Kerry concluded the controversial project is not in the country’s national security interest, and Obama announced from the White House that he agreed. “America is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change, and frankly, approving this project would have undercut that leadership,” Obama said. The massive project has been a seven-year political football during presidential and congressional elections that has pitted oil companies and Republicans against environmentalists and liberal activists. The State Department has been reviewing the project for much of Obama’s time in the White House. The proposed pipeline would span nearly 1,200 miles across six U.S. states, moving more than 800,000 barrels of carbon-heavy petroleum daily from Canadian oil sands through Nebraska to refineries in the Gulf Coast. Obama’s move comes as the White House continues to promote its environmental agenda and efforts to fight climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency this summer put forward new regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. And next month, Obama will attend the Paris climate talks run by the United Nations, he announced Friday. The White House is hoping to broker an international agreement committing every country to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and enact other policies to curb global warming. The President has also stepped up his rhetoric on the need to address global warming, pushing back against Republicans and climate skeptics fighting his agenda. “We know that human activity is changing the climate,” Obama said during a visit to Alaska in late summer. “We know that human ingenuity can do something about it. We’re even starting to see that we might actually have the political will to succeed. So the time to heed the critics and cynics is past. The time to plead ignorance is surely past. The deniers are increasingly alone, on their own shrinking island.” In a statement Friday, Kerry said the climate impact was the key factor. “The critical factor in my determination was this: moving forward with this project would significantly undermine our ability to continue leading the world in combatting climate change,” he said. Liberals and environmentalists, including top donors such as California’s Tom Steyer, who has committed tens of millions of dollars to fighting pro-pipeline political candidates, protested Keystone and made it a cause celebre among Democrats. The project was a major issue during the 2012 presidential campaign, when GOP candidate Mitt Romney said he would approve the pipeline. Republican candidates in the 2016 race have also pledged to let the project go forward. House Speaker Paul Ryan didn’t mince words in criticizing Obama’s action. “This decision isn’t surprising, but it is sickening,” Ryan said in a statement. “So sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline,” GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump tweeted. “Thousands of jobs, good for the environment, no downside!” In his speech, Obama said that he believed Keystone has had an “over-inflated role in our political discourse, and said the project’s potential to create jobs and the potential environmental threats were exaggerated. “All of this obscured the fact that this pipeline would neither be the silver bullet to the U.S. economy proclaimed by some, or the death knell to climate proclaimed by others,” Obama said. Obama also cited falling gasoline prices as another argument against the project. “While our politics have been consumed by a debate about whether or not this pipeline would create jobs or lower gas prices, we’ve gone ahead and created jobs and lowered gas prices.” The average price of regular gasoline hit $3.94 per gallon in April 2012 and stayed well above $3 for the rest of that election year. But this year, prices have been steadily below $3 per gallon. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also been caught up in Keystone politics. In October 2010, Clinton indicated she was “inclined” to approve the project but has since backed away from that stance, and in September said she opposes it. Fellow Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley also oppose the pipeline, and Clinton faced criticism from the left for not taking a firm stance. Related: Hillary Clinton’s 5 takes on the Keystone Pipeline Sanders noted his long-standing opposition to the project in a statement Friday. “It is insane for anyone to be supporting the excavation and transportation of some of the dirtiest fuel on earth,” he said. “As someone who has led the opposition to the Keystone pipeline from Day 1, I strongly applaud the President’s decision to kill this project once and for all.” Friday afternoon, Clinton tweeted her approval. “The right call. Now it’s time to make America a clean energy superpower. -H,” she tweeted. The right call. Now it's time to make America a clean energy superpower. -H  New Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he is “disappointed by the decision” but said he is looking forward to building his relationship with Obama. “The Canada-U.S. relationship is much bigger than any one project and I look forward to a fresh start with President Obama to strengthen our remarkable ties in a spirit of friendship and cooperation,” Trudeau said in a statement. “We know that Canadians want a government that they can trust to protect the environment and grow the economy. The Government of Canada will work hand-in-hand with provinces, territories and like-minded countries to combat climate change, adapt to its impacts, and create the clean jobs of tomorrow.” The lobbying fight over Keystone has been expensive, with all sides spending millions of dollars in an attempt to influence the White House and Congress. The Canadian and Alberta governments in particular have pushed Obama to approve the project, and Obama and Kerry noted the sensitivity of their decision. The President spoke with Trudeau before the White House made the verdict public. Kerry, in his official determination rejecting the project, said the U.S. government understands the impact it would have. “As Secretary of State, I fully recognize the importance of this project to Canada, one of our closest strategic allies and energy trading partners,” Kerry wrote. “We consulted with our Canadian friends and I spoke with Foreign Minister Dion today regarding this decision. While we understand the impact of this decision on Canada, I am confident that our close and long-standing relationship with Canada will continue to grow stronger in the years ahead.” Friday, TransCanada, the firm behind the $8 billion project, said it will “review all of its options” in light of Obama’s decision. “Those options include filing a new application to receive a Presidential Permit for a cross border crude oil pipeline from Canada to the United States,” the company’s statement said. “Today, misplaced symbolism was chosen over merit and science - rhetoric won out over reason,” company president and CEO Russ Girling said. “TransCanada is reviewing the decision and its rationale. We believe KXL is in the best interest of the United States and Canada.” Earlier this week, Kerry rejected a request by the company to halt its review of the pipeline as it awaits a separate process at the state level. TransCanada said it could take up to 12 months for the Nebraska process to be completed, adding further delay to the already lengthy approval process. But such a move would have pushed the final decision on Keystone past 2016 and left it to Obama’s successor. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said “there may be politics at play” in TransCanada’s request, suggesting it was an attempt to orchestrate such a scenario. TransCanada, which has spent at least $2.5 billion on the project thus far, first applied for a permit to build the pipeline in 2008. Obama vetoed legislation green-lighting the construction of the pipeline in February. At the time, the White House said it opposed the bill because it would have usurped the President’s authority to approve or deny the creation of the pipeline and short-circuit the State Department analysis. Proponents of the project, including Republican presidential candidates, say the pipeline would advance energy independence in North America and construction of it will create jobs. Reaction condemning Obama’s decision came swiftly on Friday, with many accusing Obama of catering to the green lobby and political left. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called the decision “predictable.” “I wish he just would have been honest with everybody and done it a long time ago,” Christie said in Concord, New Hampshire. “Why did he lie to the American people for so long that he was considering it? Did anybody with any common sense believe that Barack Obama was ever really seriously considering the Keystone pipeline?” “When I’m president, Keystone will be approved, and President Obama’s backward energy policies will come to an end,” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said in a statement. “The Obama Admin’s politically motivated rejection of the Keystone XL Pipeline is a self-inflicted attack on the U.S. economy and jobs,” former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweeted. “President Obama is bowing to radical environmentalists and snubbing thousands of high quality, high paying energy sector jobs,” Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal tweeted. “Obama’s rejection of #KeystoneXL will flush American jobs down the drain… all to appease the agenda of science denying radicals,” Jindal said in another tweet. Keystone also split a key Democratic constituency – organized labor. Terry O’Sullivan, the general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, blasted the decision. “After a seven-year circus of cowardly delay, the President’s decision to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline is just one more indication of an utter disdain and disregard for salt-of-the-earth, middle-class working Americans,” O’Sullivan said. ’s Tal Kopan and Dan Merica contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Mark Preston talks with Dana Bash and Gloria Borger about the bygone era of bipartisanship in Washington and the future of the Democratic and Republican parties Mark Preston: President Trump spends more time focused on criticizing those who don't agree with him, traditional bargaining has become a thing of the past Editor’s Note: Mark Preston is ’s executive director of political programming and senior political analyst. He hosts “Full Stop with Mark Preston” on SiriusXM POTUS 124. The full interview can be heard on Saturday at 12 p.m. ET, Sunday at 1 a.m. ET, and Sunday at 5 p.m. ET. Follow him at @preston. It is difficult to definitively say that dysfunction and partisanship in the nation’s capital is at an historic high in the era of Trump. After all, it was 161 years ago that South Carolina Rep. Preston Brooks nearly beat Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner to death with a cane on the Senate floor. That 1856 attack was over the issue of slavery, a subject that five years later would turn brother against brother in a bloody conflict resulting in the deaths of more than 600,000 soldiers and the emancipation of African-American slaves. Infighting causes clashes in Trump White House By no means are we now, as a nation, engaged in a civil war. But it would be dishonest to disregard the current of anger and frustration pulsating from coast to coast over the direction of the country. It is dividing families and friends and in some cases, leading to violence – as with the June shooting that left five people wounded, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. On Capitol Hill, the wheels of progress and action are barely turning, while down the street at the White House, President Donald Trump spends more time criticizing, rather than cajoling, Democrats and Republicans to try and work together. It was not always this way. Compromise was not always a heretical word. A concession meant you got some of what you wanted, just not all of it. Republicans and Democrats would walk away from the bargaining table half happy, half disappointed – but it allowed each political party to save face and live to debate, fight and negotiate another day. Nowadays, this type of legislating is a distant memory. In the debut episode of “Full Stop with Mark Preston,” my two  colleagues, Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash and Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger recall the days of compromise as well as explain the challenges they faced as female journalists in a male dominated town. Below are some of the highlights of our hour long interview. (This Q&A has been edited for brevity, clarity and flow). Mark Preston: When you look at President Trump winning in November and where we are right now in mid-summer, what is the mood (on) Capitol Hill? Sessions responds to Trump's criticism Dana Bash: It’s tense, it’s chaotic. (The Republicans) have a President who wants to get things done, but he’s so easily distracted by whatever it is he sees on cable television in the morning and most importantly, the Russia investigation. Gloria Borger: I think chaos is a good word, and I think it’s sort of chaotic within each party. Because the Republicans on health care and every other issue can’t figure out how to proceed, and they don’t have leadership at the White House. And the Democrats have their own problems because they’ve lost four (special) elections in a row now and they’re trying to figure out what their message is aside from being anti-Trump, and I think it’s a quite difficult path for all of them. Listen here Preston: When Trent Lott and Tom Daschle were the Republican leader and the Democratic leader … September 11th occurred, we had the anthrax attack on the Hart building … we also had the 50-50 split in the United States Senate where Republicans had to cede power to Democrats midway through a Congress. It was crazy – however, it seemed like (Congress) could at least function back then. Bash: Definitely. … Do you remember Daschle and Lott had a (private) phone (line), basically, where they could talk to each other, across party lines … so they could just get a deal done? I say this all the time … how many hours we would stand outside of Senator X or Congressman Y’s office when there were bipartisan meetings happening inside, usually with multiple representatives of the White House. And the question wasn’t, “Is there going to be a bipartisan deal?” It was, “What is the bipartisan deal going to look like?” Cabinet members beware: What Trump is doing to Sessions can happen to you Borger: You know you always felt that – and tell me if you guys disagree – when there was a big thing going on and they were backed up against a wall, they would always end up cutting a deal and getting something done. Now it’s exactly the opposite. Bash: You always had adults in the room Borger: Right, and so you always felt, they’re going to work it out. Now as we look at health care, et cetera, you think nothing’s going to happen. And it’s just a different mind-set now where I always felt that somehow the grown-ups, as Dana puts it, would work it out. Preston: Are there multiple wars occurring right now? When I say multiple wars … let’s just go back 10 years or 12 years … you had a little bit of infighting within the party, John McCain would fight with his own Republicans, you would have Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska who was more of a centrist, he would fight with Harry Reid who was the liberal leader. But now you almost have this ongoing war inside the Republican Party, this ongoing war inside the Democratic Party. They can’t seem to clean up their own messes internally in order to then fight each other. President continues public attacks on Sessions Bash: Well, yeah, that’s true. That’s totally true. Except that we are accepting the sad reality that Democrats aren’t even involved. Now they don’t want to be involved in anything that has to do with repealing Obamacare, so that’s sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Preston: You know, I was talking to a very powerful lobbyist recently, a Republican lobbyist, and just talking about health care, and this lobbyist’s head was almost exploding, saying they had seven years to get something done, seven years, and they really dropped the ball on it. Borger: As John Boehner said, the Republicans have never known what they wanted to do on health care, and he’s so happy he’s not here having to figure it out. But now that he is free to speak his mind, he says it quite openly. Listen here Preston: If you look at the Democratic Party right now, where is the leadership coming from? Why Breitbart hasn't gone to war for Sessions Bash: It’s coming from the grassroots. The problem is that “the resistance,” like any resistance at any point in history, they are purists and they are impatient, and so it doesn’t really gel well with a reality of how a party gets its mojo back, and this party is really, really struggling with that. Borger: (Democrats) have been hollowed out at the state level, so where are the leaders coming from? This is a question, it’s generational obviously, but is there any natural person on the horizon? Everyone talks about (Massachusetts Sen.) Elizabeth Warren, but is there a uniter of the Democratic party on the horizon? Preston: Let’s talk about the Republican Party. (Republicans) do have a deep bench, don’t they? Borger: Look, they had a deep bench this past election. I’m looking at a book on your desk by (Ohio Gov.) John Kasich, “Two Paths.” He was part of the bench and he’ll run again, I believe. … Look at Marco Rubio … Ted Cruz may decide (to run) again. Preston: Let’s talk about your career, you started as a newspaper reporter? Borger: At the Washington Star … they hired me at the Washington Star after I got out (of college). I was all set to go to journalism school and then I got this job, so I took it. I covered cops and dead bodies and I threw up at my first police scene. Preston: Can I ask something gruesome? Was it a gunshot? Borger: It was a stabbing. Anyway, Brenda Starr, girl reporter, goes out and throws up (and) people at the newspaper went out and dined out on that forever. Preston: Was it (similar to) “Mad Men”? Borger: Well my first boss, who was a wonderful guy, told me he hired me as an intern because I had good legs. Preston: Are you serious? Borger: That’s why he hired me. I didn’t know how to kind of receive that, you just didn’t. It was bizarre, but it wasn’t like you just take him to HR or anything. Bash: (Now) we have power in numbers. There’ s just a lot of us, and … because of that we have a camaraderie, a sisterhood. Listen here Preston: What are the misperceptions of journalism? Bash: I think journalism has changed for the better, and it’s not just “here’s what he said, here’s what she said” back to you. It is, “Here is what they are saying and here is what the truth is.” We’re liberated to aggressively talk about the truth, the reality, and not have these false equivalencies that frankly did exist when I first started in journalism. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Green Party likely nominee Dr. Jill Stein told  that there is room in her party for disappointed Bernie Sanders fans Stein said she viewed Sanders as a kindred revolutionary As the Democratic primary winds down to a close, Green Party likely nominee Dr. Jill Stein said she wanted Bernie Sanders supporters to “know that there’s a plan B here to continue to fight that revolution.” Sanders went from a long-shot candidate to the head of a national progressive movement in months, and Stein said she believed many of his supporters, turned off by presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s record and a bruising primary season, might go Stein’s way. Jill Stein: The Democratic Party ‘fakes left,’ marches right Stein offered condolences to Sanders supporters and praised Sanders for running a “revolutionary” movement that spoke to the issues she also cares about in an interview with  Tuesday evening. “We are here in the event that they feel like they don’t have a place to go,” Stein said. Stein, who was also the Green Party’s 2012 nominee, said she viewed Sanders as a kindred revolutionary, battling the political establishment. She called Clinton’s path to the nomination “a coronation” aided by the media and the Democratic Party. Stein said that although Clinton and news organizations – including  – had declared her the presumptive Democratic nominee, it was up to Sanders’ supporters not to accept that as the end of their movement. “If Bernie endorses Hillary, I urge Bernie’s supporters not to throw in the towel,” Stein said. Green Party candidate Jill Stein: ‘We need to fix our broken political system’ Stein slammed Clinton, saying the former secretary of state does not have “a track record that has been good for women and children.” The fact that Clinton has become the first female presumptive presidential nominee for the Democratic or Republican parties did not influence her either. “We need not just someone who is born with a particular gender identity, but someone in the office who supports women,” Stein said, pointing out that she was also a woman and a feminist running for president. The likely Green Party nominee is pushing progressive positions, including eliminating student debt, cracking down on Wall Street and putting an end to military interventions overseas. Stein said her campaign had no particular outreach plans set for Sanders’ voters because she wanted to be “respectful of the Sanders campaign and his supporters.” She said she had reached out to the Sanders campaign to collaborate in the past many times and that he had never responded. She said that many of Sanders’ supporters were instead seeking her out. “It’s very hard having a revolutionary campaign in a counter-revolutionary party,” Stein said. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Jeb Bush has fallen to 3% in Friday's /ORC national poll Bush has struggled to have a consistent message that breaks through His campaign says there is time, but admits numbers won't spike overnight Jeb Bush has tried everything. His campaign allies have blanketed the airwaves with almost $30 million in ads. Aiming to shake the “low-energy” tag and prove his toughness, Bush hit Donald Trump as a carnival barker unfit for the serious job of being President. He attacked Sen. Marco Rubio, suggesting his former protégé was a dilettante in a hurry. He cut staff, hired a debate coach, and pledged that “Jeb Can Fix It.” Bush is now polling at 3% – and dropping. The 3% figure puts Bush in sixth place in the national GOP race, according to the /ORC poll released Friday morning. It’s the latest insult and disappointment for Bush, a son and brother of presidents, the conservative former two-term governor of Florida and the man who started the race as the unquestioned establishment favorite. With two months left before the Iowa caucuses, Bush is saddled with the nagging questions: What happened? And is there anything the self-proclaimed “joyful tortoise” can do to turn things around? RELATED: Jeb Bush: I will ‘whup’ Hillary Clinton Bush has struggled to gain traction and settle on a distinctive message to set him apart from his Republican opponents. He has often said that elections are about the future, but his major accomplishments happened more than a decade ago. And vowing to be his own man who isn’t tied to the politics and policies of his older brother, George W. Bush, Jeb Bush has also said his family ties give him insights into foreign policy while his campaign brought on advisers from the old days. Bush’s stump speech has fluctuated as well. He used to frequently talk about his Mexican-born wife, Columba, lapse into Spanish, and promise to campaign with “brazos abiertos” – arms wide open – touting his appeal to non-white voters. Now, he doesn’t mention his Hispanic ties quite as often. Given the success of political outsiders Trump and Ben Carson, asked if this was simply the wrong year for a former two-term governor like him, Bush said no. And he insists that there is still plenty of time for his well-funded state-by-state campaign to catch on among Republican voters who have largely viewed his candidacy with a shrug. “In Iowa it’s a question of organization, in New Hampshire, it’s retail politics. In South Carolina, a great organization matters. I’m making great progress in those states. And we have the best campaign in Nevada,” Bush said Wednesday morning in an interview with Iowa Public Television. “So, look, in October, in November, even in December of the last two election cycles, the people that were winning in December weren’t the ones that ended up winning. It’s just the nature of the beast, and there’s no reason to rewrite history. People make up their minds late.” RELATED: Trump to Republican Jewish Coalition: ‘I’m a negotiator like you’ In New Hampshire, where Bush is in single digits, voters have opened their mailboxes over the last days to find direct mail pieces aimed at helping them make up their minds. The pieces make the central arguments of Bush’s campaign – that he was “Veto Corleone” in Florida, could shake up Washington and that he is a doer, not a talker — a clear swipe at Trump. On Monday, his campaign rolled out a video called “Storm Governor” that highlighted Bush’s leadership after Hurricane Ivan hit the Sunshine State in 2004. But the video, which includes footage of a not-yet-grey Bush, is also a reminder that convincing New Hampshire voters what he did 11 years ago in Florida is relevant is a hard case to make. Bush has continued to emphasize his seriousness and experience, especially in the national security field. A new ad called “Honor” featuring Medal of Honor winners started airing in New Hampshire and Boston on Wednesday on Fox News – the spot is part of a $600,000 ad buy that will run for three weeks. “This is no reality show. This is serious business,” says retired Marine Maj. Gen. James Livingston, who has been helping Bush in South Carolina. “This is about the livelihood of our kids and grandkids.” Then, with a picture of President Barack Obama on the screen: “This commander-in-chief requires training wheels.” His campaign doesn’t expect poll numbers to rebound quickly. “It’s just not an expectation that we have or something we’re concerned about. I think what we’ve got to be concerned about is getting Jeb in front of voters in the early states,” said communications director Tim Miller. He highlighted their ground game and said Bush will continue to talk more about national security and spend a lot of time in New Hampshire in the coming two months. He’ll be joined by surrogates who can serve as validators for Bush’s record. And the campaign, he said, has seen increased conversions among voters in phone calls and door knocking over the past few weeks. “It’s something that we feel optimistic about and so that infrastructure needs to be in place to capitalize on what we hope is momentum heading into the primaries and caucuses,” he said. On the stump – mostly in South Carolina and New Hampshire – Bush has shifted from telling his life story to telling stories from people featured in some of his early campaign videos. This is far from Bush’s first political campaign, but at times the press-the-flesh aspect of retail campaigning has eluded him. At an Iowa event on Monday, for example, rather than work the buffet line at a high-attendance dinner, he simply got his food and went back to his table, politely stopping to take selfies with people who came over to greet him. He quickly rushed out after his speech. Instead, the governor, a self-described introvert, fares better in smaller, more intimate events, like his town halls with 100 to 200 people. Those settings allow him to engage in one-on-one interactions that sometimes lead to long conversations afterwards when he sticks around to mix and mingle with as many voters who want to meet him. Mindful of his brother’s stumbles in New Hampshire in 2000, when he lost to John McCain, it’s those same town halls and house parties where Jeb Bush excels. “In the past candidates in who have campaigned in traditional way with town halls and house parties have been rewarded by voters and candidates who cut corners and just give big speeches suffer,” said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire GOP. “But in this cycle, voters don’t seem to be punishing Ben Carson and Donald Trump who have hardly done any traditional campaigning at all. The candidates who are wearing out their shoes aren’t really getting credit.” RELATED: Jeb Bush has a way with words Bush’s hope is that all the rules of prior presidential campaigns finally begin to shape the race. In the 2004 Democratic campaign, veteran Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry staged a comeback against then-Vermont Gov. Howard Dean in the weeks before Iowa. And in 2008, GOP Sen. John McCain ignored Iowa and camped out in New Hampshire to launch a comeback. But McCain and Kerry were sitting senators and war heroes with inspiring biographies. Bush doesn’t doesn’t deliver soaring speeches or great soundbites and debate riffs. And in his almost decade away from elective office, his party has moved rightward, fueled by an angry base that Bush has yet to connect with. “When we get closer to this…the decision will be made by voters really on the following things: Do you have ideas that will make my life better? Do you have the fortitude, the leadership skills to make it happen?…Do you care about me?” he said in Iowa. “Do you care about the condition that I’m in? And, look, my life experience is 32 years in business, eight years as a reform minded governor. I think over time that, that kind of skillset that I’ve acquired through my life experience will be helpful to me for sure.” CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the year John McCain campaigned for and became the GOP presidential nominee. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that African Americans are so delighted with his attacks on the city of Baltimore and US congressman Elijah Cummings, an African American, that they are calling him at the White House in large numbers to thank him. He also claimed that African Americans are generally happy with his performance as president. “What I’ve done for African Americans, no president, I would say, has done. Now, I’ll say this: they are so happy, because I get the calls,” he told reporters as he left for a speech in Virginia that was boycotted by black state lawmakers. “They are so happy at what I’ve been able to do in Baltimore and other Democratic-run, corrupt cities.” He continued later: “The African American people have been calling the White House. They have never been so happy as what a president has done. Not only the lowest unemployment in history for African Americans, not only opportunity zones for, really, the biggest beneficiary the inner city, and not only criminal justice reform. But they’re so happy that I pointed out the corrupt politics of Baltimore. It’s filthy dirty. It’s so horrible. And they are happy as hell.” Donald Trump made 78 false claims last week Since the controversy over Trump’s comments about Baltimore and Cummings is too new to be captured by most of the available polling data, we can’t definitively fact-check Trump’s claim about African Americans’ views on these remarks – though it’s worth noting that Trump has a history of inventing nonexistent phone calls and making dubious claims about people expressing gratitude him in private conversations. We can, however, definitively fact-check his claim that African Americans are generally pleased with his performance. They are not. Facts First: African Americans are overwhelmingly unhappy with Trump’s job performance, polls have consistently shown. Exit polls of the 2016 election found that Trump received 8% of votes cast by African Americans, with 89% of them choosing Democrat Hillary Clinton. Opinion polls in the subsequent two-and-a-half years have found that he remains highly unpopular among African Americans. Trump began talking negatively about Cummings and Baltimore in a series of tweets on July 27. In a Quinnipiac University poll conducted from July 25 to July 28 – two days before the tweets, the day of the tweets, and one day after the tweets – Trump had a 6% approval rating and 84% disapproval rating with black voters. Eighty percent of black voters said Trump is racist, while just 11% said he is not. A Fox News poll conducted from July 21 to July 23 had Trump at 75% disapproval among black registered voters, with 22% approval. In a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted June 28 to July 1, 81% of African Americans said they disapproved; 18% approved. Both of those approval numbers were substantially better than the one in the new Quinnipiac poll, but still: On the whole, large majorities of African Americans were displeased with him. Trump’s tweets about Cummings and Baltimore were not identical to his tweets about four Democratic congresswomen of color two weeks prior. But it’s important to note that black voters were unhappy about those earlier tweets: 76% in the Fox News poll said it is racist to tell a person of color to “go back” to their country of origin, while 9% said it was not. (Only one of the four congresswomen, Rep. Ilhan Omar, was born abroad.) In the Fox poll, just 11% of black registered voters approved of how he was handling race relations; 83% disapproved. And, when asked if Trump respects racial minorities, 78% of black registered voters said no. Trump has emphasized the economy in his pitch to black voters, noting on Tuesday and on numerous previous occasions that the African American unemployment rate has fallen to a record low 6.0% during his tenure. (It fell from 12.7% to 7.9% under President Barack Obama, then from 7.9% to 6.0% under Trump.) But black voters remain unhappy with Trump even on the economy in particular: 64% in the Fox News poll disapproved of his handling of the issue. There was not a single issue on which black voters in the Fox poll gave him a net positive rating. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

        "articles": "Warren is already seen as one of Democrats' foremost voices The party is without a national leader and its path forward on policy is not yet settled In the aftermath of last year’s election, the centrist old guard is out and progressives have won the battle for the soul of the Democratic Party, Elizabeth Warren declared Saturday. “But, boy, we’ve inherited a hell of a challenge, haven’t we?” she said at an annual gathering here of thousands of progressive activists. In a speech that outlined Warren’s vision for the party’s future, the Massachusetts senator offered a series of policy prescriptions, calling on Democrats to push for Medicare for all, debt-free college or technical school, universal pre-kindergarten, a $15-an-hour minimum wage and portable benefits. She dug in against President Donald Trump, saying Democrats would defend undocumented immigrants brought into the United States as children and that “we’re never, ever going to build your stupid wall.” And she celebrated the ascendant progressive wing’s takeover of the party – which has accelerated since November’s election. “We don’t have to tip-toe anymore. We don’t have to hedge our bets,” Warren said. Through her speech, Warren didn’t shy away from the prospect of a 2020 campaign for the presidency. “We’re going to fight to put more women in positions of power,” she said at one point, “from committee rooms to boardrooms to that really nice oval-shaped room at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.” The crowd responded with chants of “Warren 2020!” Warren paused and smiled, and then moved on without directly addressing the chants. Warren is already seen as one of Democrats’ foremost voices – along with Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders – on progressives’ economic policies. So she used her speech in front of about 3,000 attendees at the progressive Netroots Nation conference Saturday to dive into issues of culture, which have split progressive and centrist Democrats since Hillary Clinton’s loss in November. In a shot at Bill Clinton-era Democratic policies, Warren said Democrats are not “going back to the days of welfare reform and the crime bill.” “We’re not going back to the days of being lukewarm on choice,” she said. “We’re not going back to the days when universal health care was something Democrats talked about on the campaign trail but were too chicken to fight for after they got elected.” Warren’s comments came at a crucial moment for the Democratic Party. Its base is energized by the fight against Trump, and Democrats were thrilled to see the GOP effort to repeal former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act fail in late July. However, the party is also without a national leader, and its path forward on policy is not yet settled. For the first time in decades, Democrats reacted to a national election loss by moving leftward – rather than to the center. The party’s leaders have embraced confrontational tactics against Trump, while a growing list of its top prospects for the 2020 presidential race – including Warren – are embracing Sanders’ call for a “Medicare for all” single-payer health care system. But that shift has caused consternation in some quarters. Some leading Democrats – including Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy – recently backed the launch of a group called “New Democracy,” aimed at moving Democrats toward positions that can win over moderates, independents and disaffected Republicans. Warren pointed to a New York Times op-ed by Mark Penn, a Hillary Clinton 2008 campaign strategist, who called for the party to abandon “identity politics.” Warren noted that those calls, after previous election losses, had prevailed. “This time, no one cared,” she said. “Big yawn.” “In the wake of the last election, I’ve heard people say we need to decide whether we’re the party of the white working class or the party of Black Lives Matter,” Warren said. “I say we can care about a dad who’s worried that his kid will have to move away from their factory town to find good work – and we can care about a mom who’s worried that her kid will get shot during a traffic stop,” she said. “The way I see it, those two parents have something deep down in common – the system is rigged against both of them – and against their kids.” Warren argued that many of the voters who abandoned Democrats and either fell into Trump’s camp or stayed home in November because they see a “rigged” system and “don’t feel like anyone in politics is doing anything to un-rig it, or it’s too broken to un-rig at all.” “So spare me the argument about whether we ought to be trying to bring back folks who voted for Donald Trump or trying to turn out folks who just didn’t vote,” she said. “Because we can’t do either of those things until we can show that things can change – and that we will fight to change them.” Warren broke out her biggest applause line mid-speech, saying Democrats don’t need permission from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – a reference to a clash between her and the Kentucky Republican earlier this year. “He would probably tell me to sit down and shut up,” Warren said. “Nevertheless, I would persist.” © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Editor’s Note: James A. Gagliano is a  law enforcement analyst and retired FBI supervisory special agent. He is also an adjunct assistant professor at St. John’s University in Queens, New York. Follow him on Twitter: @JamesAGagliano. The views expressed in this commentary are his. Read more opinion on . A whistleblower’s recent bombshell revelation highlighting the US President’s quid pro quo attempts to leverage military aid to Ukraine, in exchange for an investigation into one of his chief 2020 political rivals, Joe Biden, has been supported by a rough White House telephone transcript. The accusation, which has led to a House impeachment inquiry, was further buttressed by the recent testimony of a commissioned US Army officer, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who serves on the National Security Council and was a party to the telephone call. When the Justice Department under Attorney General William Barr blocked attempts to share the whistleblower complaint with Congress and publicly pronounced the President guilty of no crime related to it, critics were incensed, leading the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff, to convene its own hearings into the charges. Democrats briefly flirted with idea of impeaching Barr but have pivoted to the more ambitious task of impeaching the President. Still, there ought to be a less fraught path by which Congress could forestall the possibility of a potentially compromised attorney general – an efficient way for the legislature to shield the AG position from partisan influence, real or imagined. What if the attorney general position was assured of a term that would extend beyond the term of the president who appointed them? Barr’s contentious confirmation hearings last winter served to highlight our nation’s deep political divisions, as he repeatedly came under fire from opposition-party critics who warned that his seeming lack of independence and partisan tendencies would be dangerous at the helm of DOJ. After all, Barr had famously earned the President’s attention with a June 8, 2018, memorandum to then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, adding support to the argument that Donald Trump should not face obstruction of justice charges in the Mueller investigation. It is almost as if the future AG’s opinion was that presidents may ultimately be above the law. President Trump was understandably enamored with this take, deciding to nominate Barr to succeed Jeff Sessions on February 14 this year. Barr previously served as the 77th AG, under President George H.W. Bush. Trump exposes and exploits holes in the traditional nation-state While Barr appeared confident and at ease during his confirmation hearings, parrying barbs from concerned Democrats, that was little-league stuff compared to what he would face following his decision to release a four-page summary of the 448-page Mueller report. Enraged critics alleged that Barr’s summary document served less to communicate Mueller’s principal conclusions and more as a preemptive diminution of heavier charges that, if not indictable, were certainly impeachment-worthy. So, is Barr the most partisan AG in recent memory? Presidential cabinet positions are political appointments. Those who fill them understand that they serve at the pleasure (or whim) of the president. Our nation’s first President, George Washington, appointed Edmund Randolph in 1789 to the position, and essentially charged him with shaping and defining our country’s justice system. Across the ensuing 230 years, members of the minority party have consistently complained of bias. In recent memory, look no further back than the “Pearl Harbor Day Massacre” in 2006, when George W. Bush’s AG, Alberto Gonzalez, insisted that the curious midterm firings of eight Republican US attorneys had nothing to do with politics. Gonzalez’s top deputy later attributed the firings to “performance-related” issues. Critics begged to differ, suggesting that the supposedly independent US attorneys were fired for refusing to remain in complete lockstep with the presidential administration they served. During the early 1960s, John F. Kennedy’s brother Robert served as his AG – an appointment that led to understandable charges of nepotism. And another more recent president who appeared to enjoy a cozy, quasi-sibling relationship with one of his AGs was Barack Obama. Here’s how his first selection, Eric Holder, described the relationship he shared with his boss in 2013: “I’m still enjoying what I’m doing, there’s still work to be done. I’m still the President’s wingman, so I’m there with my boy.” Impeachment proceedings could be a gift to US enemies Loretta Lynch, Holder’s eventual replacement, would end up recusing herself from the FBI’s 2016 investigation into then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s private email server because of an ill-advised private meeting with the candidate’s husband, former President Bill Clinton. Lynch later described the impromptu tarmac meeting as simply a conversation about their travels, golf and grandchildren. If nothing else, it gave the appearance of unseemly partisanship. Even more baffling were Lynch’s instructions to then-FBI Director James Comey to avoid referring publicly to the Clinton investigation as an investigation. Comey testified to the curious term that Lynch wanted him to use: a “matter.” Lynch has denied this conversation ever took place. If these examples indicate the position may be subject to undue partisan influence, then what, if anything, can be done to combat that influence? One available solution may be to subject the AG position to something like the provision in Section 203 of the Crime Control Act of 1976, which sets forth a 10-year term for the director of the post-J. Edgar Hoover FBI. Such a term would serve as a check on presidential power, helping to foster a DOJ better prepared to resist partisan influence. It would be more difficult to exert pressure on an AG who is certain to outlast the presidential administration that appointed them. That job security could essentially inspire the courage necessary to stand up to a president’s orders – or suggestions – of any act that appears partisan, untoward, unethical or illegal. This new protocol wouldn’t protect the AG from, say, getting fired for cause, just as Comey’s 10-year term as director of the FBI didn’t prevent Trump from firing him – but it would still offer a much-needed guardrail against partisanship. It is almost impossible to imagine this Congress coming to consensus on any matter these days. But a 10-year term for attorneys general should be palatable to both political parties, who know by now that one side never remains in power – or out of power – for too long. Congress should make this change in the spirit of a bipartisan commitment to maintaining an apolitical Justice Department. Make it before the final scintilla of America’s waning trust and confidence in the department’s independence is gone. Act before it’s too late. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company.

        "articles": "Supreme Court won't take up challenge to Connecticut post-Sandy Hook gun law Law bans certain types of 'assault weapons' and ammunition The Supreme Court declined Monday to take up a constitutional challenge to a Connecticut gun law passed in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The law bans certain semi-automatic assault weapons and large capacity magazines. Although the decision comes days after the Orlando shooting, that event probably didn’t move the justices either way. In recent years the Court has declined to take up a major Second Amendment case. In 2008, 5-4 Supreme Court held in District of Columbia v Heller that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to bear arms, and except for a follow up decision two years later, the court has not weighed in again. Since then, a raging debate has developed between gun rights supporters who say that lower courts are not heeding supreme court precedent and gun control activists who say they are pushing for what they consider reasonable restrictions. “The Supreme Court’s decision to let stand Connecticut’s assault weapons restrictions, is just the latest indication that Courts almost universally recognize that common sense life-saving gun laws are fully compatible with the Second Amendment, ” said Jonathan Lowy, director of the Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun violence. “The fact that Connecticut chose to restrict assault weapons like the ones used in the Orlando and Sandy Hook mass shootings was both reasonable and constitutional,” he said. Gun rights groups – the plaintiffs in Shew v. Malloy – had hoped the Supreme Court would step in to clarify the Heller decision. Scott Wilson Sr., president of the Connecticut Citizens’ Defense League, a gun rights group, issued a statement saying that his group fully intends “to renew our challenge to Connecticut’s blatantly unconstitutional ban as soon as there are five Justices sitting on the Supreme Court committed to the proper understanding of the Second Amendment.” To do so, Wilson would need to find another challenger to bring up the case. It is a long-shot strategy, especially if the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia is filled by a nominee from a Democratic president. The Heller decision was written by the late Scalia and is considered one of the most important cases of his legacy. Connecticut’s law was passed after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, when 20 students and six educators were killed, and expanded the list of assault weapons that had already been prohibited in the state. In court papers, state Attorney General George Jepsen said the law was aimed at restricting access “to firearms that are owned by a small percentage of gun owners and are disproportionately used in gun crime, particularly the most heinous forms of gun violence.” He added, “The shooter fired 154 rounds with devastating accuracy and efficiency with a firearm that was designed for killing human beings in close quarters, an AR-15 type rifle.” © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "President Donald Trump told Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan he would grant McAleenan a pardon if he were sent to jail for having border agents block asylum seekers from entering the US in defiance of US law, senior administration officials tell . Trump reportedly made the comment during a visit to the border at Calexico, California, a week ago. It was not clear if the comment was a joke. Two officials briefed on the exchange say the President told McAleenan, since named the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that he “would pardon him if he ever went to jail for denying US entry to migrants,” as one of the officials paraphrased. The White House referred  to the Department of Homeland Security. A DHS spokesman told , “At no time has the President indicated, asked, directed or pressured the Acting Secretary to do anything illegal. Nor would the Acting Secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our responsibility to enforce the law.” Trump denied reports he offered pardons in a tweet late Friday night. Trump confirms he's looking at releasing detained immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities The exchange came amid threats by the President to close the border in response to a steep uptick of migrants at the border. In March, there were approximately 92,000 arrests of undocumented migrants for illegal entry on the southern border, up from 37,390 last March, according to CBP. During his visit to Calexico last Friday, Trump said on camera: “We’re full, our system’s full, our country’s full – can’t come in! Our country is full, what can you do? We can’t handle any more, our country is full. Can’t come in, I’m sorry. It’s very simple.” Behind the scenes, two sources told , the President told border agents to not let migrants in. Tell them we don’t have the capacity, he said. If judges give you trouble, say, “Sorry, judge, I can’t do it. We don’t have the room.” RELATED: Trump pushed to close El Paso border, told admin officials to resume family separations and agents not to admit migrants After the President left the room, agents sought further advice from their leaders, who told them they were not giving them that direction and if they did what the President said they would take on personal liability. You have to follow the law, they were told. Trump has grown frustrated by the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border, placing blame on Democrats and the nation’s immigration laws. On Friday, the President said he’s considering releasing immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities in part to retaliate against Democrats, undercutting earlier denials from his own administration officials. “Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,” Trump said on Twitter. “The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy – so this should make them very happy!” Yet the White House received legal guidance months ago that such a policy would run afoul of the law, open the administration to lawsuits, and ultimately undermine the President’s desire to deport undocumented immigrants. WH told by lawyers in February that proposal to drop migrants in sanctuary cities had legal issues In February, according to documents obtained by , the general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, John Mitnick, told the White House in writing that such a move could only be done if there was a “strong, mission-related rationale” pertaining to the responsibilities of the department. ’s Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Do Not Sell After years of unsuccessfully looking for steady work in Boston, Sharada Jambulapati's father set his sights on the Deep South. He bought a farm and soon afterward, moved the family to the small 450-person town of Whigham, Georgia. It was the 1990's and for this family of Indian immigrants, the Mayberry-like town seemed to offer chance at a new start. But life in Whigham presented its own difficulties. Most of the town's residents were either white or black and the Jambulapatis stood out. Sharada remembers classmates and others using terms like 'nigger,' 'dirty' and 'illegal.' \"Even teachers seemed too comfortable using unacceptable words,\" she said. But things were slowly starting to change as a growing number of immigrants opted to move to the suburbs or rural areas over the big cities. \"The new people that arrived around that time -- mostly from Latin America -- were seen as 'the other.' They weren't assigned a race, they were just 'foreign,'\" Jambulapati recalled. \"Growing up, I always felt so alone,\" she said. But now, many years later, she has found the place where she belongs. Jambulapati is now getting her law degree at the University of California, Berkeley. Her dream is to serve as an advocate for immigrant children and young convicts, who feel much like she did when she was growing up. To help her pursue this goal, she was recently granted the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans, which pays up to $90,000 for the graduate education of immigrants or children of immigrants. \"My main desire is that we have justice in this society for people like my family,\" Jambulapati said. \"I can never let go of my personal experiences, of seeing the struggles that my mom faced and the experiences that the Latino and Black communities have endured.\" Related: I want to bring health care to undocumented immigrants When they first moved to the farm in Whigham, Jambulapati's father grew cotton and corn. But as the South Asian population expanded -- especially a few hours away in Atlanta -- he began to grow curry leaves and other vegetables used in South Asian cuisine, selling them at Hindu temples and at the Dekalb Farmers Market in the city of Decatur. \"He struggled to make ends meet at first,\" Jambulapati said. The stresses of life in Whigham pulled her parents apart. And a few years after the family's arrival, they divorced. The three kids and their mother all stayed in a mobile home on the farm. Their dad moved into a place in town. The split was especially difficult for Jambulapati's mother, who struggled with English and had a limited education. \"My parents divorced and she always took jobs that didn't pay more than $10,000 a year. I remember filling out her applications and sometimes she would be rejected even if she was qualified,\" she said. Her mother took jobs as a factory seamstress and a janitor. Eventually, she found work in Atlanta as a nanny, but it meant leaving the kids on their own during the week. Jambulapati says her two older siblings essentially raised her. \"They were exceptional role models,\" she said. Despite the hardships they endured, the three siblings were all able to attend college and pursue graduate degrees. Her sister would eventually get a master's in public policy from Georgetown University and now teaches at a charter school. Her brother is now getting his PhD at the Sloan School of Management at MIT. For undergrad, Jambulapati attended Stanford University where she studied international relations and became active on campus about immigration and other social issues. After graduation, she received a fellowship to work at the Southern Poverty Law Center, where she had the valuable experience of advocating for children of immigrants and young convicts living mainly in Alabama. Related: Bringing solar power and jobs to low-income neighborhoods While there, she helped get undocumented immigrant children enrolled into Alabama schools that were unlawfully rejecting children because they didn't have a birth certificate or a Social Security number. As a result of the Southern Poverty Law Center's efforts, Alabama schools now no longer ask for Social Security numbers on enrollment forms, she said. Jambulapati also worked with children convicted of crimes who'd been tried as adults and imprisoned in adult facilities. She remembered visiting a boy who had sent the Southern Poverty Law Center letters expressing his fears about serving a 20-year sentence in an adult prison even though he was still a child. At age 15, he had been convicted as an adult for a felony, Jambulapati said. In the letters, he said he didn't think he'd survive in prison because he was scrawny and weighed just 120 pounds. He said he was being exposed to daily violence and sexual abuse. \"He was a kid who had been bounced around foster homes,\" Jambulapati said. \"His parents were addicts. He was a victim of injustice long before he went into the prison system. Being incarcerated was how he was going to be 'rehabilitated.'\" Related: Offering legal help to other immigrants Jambulapati says that while progress has been made, the civil rights work in the South is far from over. Now it's time to make sure that people and institutions are complying with the laws, she said. \"The South always gets knocked for its history of racism, but people forget that there are so many courageous people who live there and who are pushing through that and fighting against the injustice,\" Jambulapati said.

        "articles": "Editor’s Note: John Avlon is a  senior political analyst and anchor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are the author’s own. View more opinion articles on . There’s an old saying in American politics that a Democratic crook is just as bad as a Republican crook. The point, of course, is that we should hold people to the same standard, regardless of political party. It’s a good, solid principle. And it seems almost impossibly quaint, because the search for the truth in the Trump investigations is breaking down along partisan lines. During Michael Cohen’s testimony, Republicans focused more on attacking the witness than questioning his serious allegations. And on ’s “New Day” this week, Republican Sen. Mike Rounds suggested Trump made hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels to protect his family. “I honestly think this president loves his family,” Rounds said. The new standard seems to be that allegations of lies and obstruction of justice don’t matter to Republicans when it’s about a president from their party. We know that this is situational ethics because 20 years ago, some of the same senators were singing a very different tune. Most Democrats call for investigation instead of impeachment Here’s Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell talking to  in 1999 about impeachment proceedings against then-President Bill Clinton: “The problem is lying under oath and obstructing justice. The subject matter is not what is significant here; it’s lying under oath and obstructing justice.” McConnell voted to find President Clinton guilty on both counts – lying and obstruction of justice. Sen. Chuck Grassley, who stepped down as chairman of the judiciary committee last year, told  the importance of leaving partisanship behind during the impeachment trial in January 1999. “We are miraculously transformed from politicians to people who leave their Republican and Democrat labels at the door…We’re there to seek the truth and to find out whether the president is guilty or not guilty, and no stone should be left unturned to make that determination.” Poetic stuff. But today, the search for the truth seems secondary for Senate Republicans. Trump’s former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, took a strong stand against lying from the oval office. After Clinton was acquitted by the Senate on two articles of impeachment in February 1999, Sessions spoke out about the impact it could have on the culture of the country. “It is crucial to our system of justice that we demand the truth. I fear that an acquittal of this President will weaken the legal system by providing an option for those who consider being less than truthful in court,” he said. Ken Starr and Clinton press secretary agree: 'Impeachment is hell' One of President Trump’s strongest supporters in the Senate is South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, who was previously considered a member of the maverick posse as one of John McCain’s closest friends. When Graham was still a representative in the House, he offered a notably low standard for impeachment. “You don’t even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job in this constitutional republic … Impeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office,” he said. Former Sen. Rick Santorum, now a  commentator, also was very concerned about the impact of presidential lying at the time: “He lied to protect himself from being prosecuted for a crime. I could think of no other lie that is a more egregious lie… I fear that if this country is confronted with a serious crisis over the next two years, that his ability to marshal the American public behind what he tells them is the truth would be diminished.” When it was all over, a handful of House Democrats voted against Clinton, and several Republicans crossed partisan lines to acquit the president on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. So while partisan lines did largely hold, there were still some politicians who put their principles ahead of party loyalty. There’s precious little evidence of that now. One of the first Senate Democrats to publicly condemn Clinton’s behavior – although he did not vote for his removal from office – was Joe Lieberman, and his independence earned him a spot on the Democratic ticket as Al Gore’s running mate in 2000. Looking at the GOP’s approach to Clinton’s impeachment trial 20 years ago, it’s clear there is now a double standard when it comes to Trump. Hypocrisy used to be the unforgivable sin in American politics. But that seems to be one more casualty of Trump’s presidency. © 2021 Cable News Network. A Warner Media Company. All Rights Reserved.

        "articles": "Bernie Sanders’ campaign invoked Robert F. Kennedy in a Twitter comeback to Hillary Clinton on Tuesday. For four minutes. Then, the tweet was deleted. And the campaign hasn’t responded to questions about why. Clinton’s campaign was live-tweeting the former secretary of state’s speech on racism, piece-by-piece. One of the @HillaryClinton account’s tweets said: “Anyone asking for your vote has a responsibility to grapple with reality—to see things as they actually are, not just as we want them to be.” Anyone asking for your vote has a responsibility to grapple with reality—to see things as they actually are, not just as we want them to be. Here is the full context of Clinton’s comments: “For many white Americans, it’s tempting to believe that bigotry is largely behind us. That would leave us with a lot less work, wouldn’t it? But more than half a century after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and John Lewis bled, race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind. Now anyone – anyone asking for your vote has a responsibility to grapple with this reality. To see things as they actually are, not just as we want them to be. I’d be the first to admit I don’t have all the answers. I’ve made my own mistakes. I’ve walked my own journey. But I believe with all my heart we can and must do better.” The tweet, sans full context, sounded similar to the shots Clinton has taken at Sanders over the feasibility of his policy proposals. The @BernieSanders account – which is run by staff, not Sanders himself – had a ready response, quoting Robert F. Kennedy. The tweet: “‘Some people see things as they are and say why? I dream things that never were and say why not?’ - RFK” That tweet was deleted four minutes later, according to Politiwoops, the website that tracks politicians’ deleted tweets. Sanders’ aides have not responded to questions about why it was deleted. I can understand why the @BernieSanders team deleted this. pic.twitter.com/EWQDvD9DSq This all comes as President Barack Obama leaves the door open to an endorsement in the Democratic presidential race. During a news conference Tuesday, Obama said he’s staying out of the Democratic contest for now, but “eventually I’m sure I’ll have an opinion on that, based on my experience having been a candidate of hope and change and the cuts and bruises I have from seven years of trying to get things done.” © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "David Gergen: This is my 20th political convention and I cannot remember one with such a raucous, rocky start Trump and campaign are mirroring Nixon's 1968 presidential run and that could be a big mistake, says Gergen Editor’s Note: David Gergen is a senior political analyst for  and has been a White House adviser to four presidents. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. Follow him on Twitter: @david_gergen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Donald Trump is rightly “furious” about the controversy enveloping his wife, Melania, after her speech on GOP opening night – but he should be angry at a lot more than that and ought to be kicking himself the hardest. This is my 20th political convention and I cannot remember one that has gotten off to such a raucous, rocky start. Apparently, the Trump staff is so lean – and mean – that since conventioneers started to arrive, they have been continually misplaying one of the most important moments of the campaign. And if recent reports play out about their affinity for Richard Nixon, they are careening toward more trouble. To be sure, as the Trump camp believes, the press is blowing some of the early mishaps out of proportion and is focusing too little on barn burning speeches like that of Rudy Giuliani on opening night. But pros understand that is the nature of the game and they know how to handle it. Welcome to the NFL! The trouble started right out of the gate on Monday morning when two leading surrogates for Trump launched attacks on the Bush family, Mitt Romney, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The most jarring was the criticism that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort aimed at Kasich. It is by now axiomatic that Trump must win Ohio to win the White House, that the race here is a dead heat, and that Kasich – the most popular political leader in the state – may hold the keys to victory. Knocking him on day one was a blunder, and an omen of things to come. That very afternoon, the Trump team compounded its problems as anti-Trump forces demanded an open, roll-call vote. When Trump’s allies squelched the protesters, all hell broke loose on the convention floor. “Chaos,” the press called it, casting a shadow over the entire first day. And bitter tastes lingered: delegates on the losing side claimed they had been “strong armed.” One put it this way to me: “The Trump people would have won the roll call; they had plenty of votes. If they want to unify the party, why weren’t they smart enough to give us something we could take home?” Why not, indeed? Trump's convention choice: Bring the party together or blow it apart A surly mood continued into Monday night, but this time was directed in rat-a-tat attacks against Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the Democratic establishment. The moment that was to recast the evening in a warm glow and to serve as its climax was the debut of Melania Trump on a national stage. Convention nominees historically stay away from personal appearances until their final night, but so important was Melania’s speech that Trump flew in to introduce her. And she delivered! In the moments immediately after, commentators from one network to the next gushed over her poise, her portrayal of her husband as a patriot, and her embrace of her new homeland. She seemed, and remains, a woman of good values. Melania: the good, the bad and the beautiful By now, everyone knows the glow didn’t last long, as a sharp-eyed gent took to social media to point out the remarkable parallels between her speech and that of Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention eight years ago. A new hell broke loose across all media, shredding hopes by convention planners for a great opening night. Melania Trump is hardly the first high-profile person to be accused of plagiarism, but this won’t be forgotten quickly. Manafort: Plagiarism accusations are crazy That is especially true because the Trump campaign made such a hash of things in the aftermath Tuesday morning when they denied there was anything wrong but added – ludicrously – that if there were anything wrong, the blame should lie with Hillary Clinton! Sure. That argument came right out of a Richard Nixon playbook. When in trouble, stonewall. And perhaps therein lies the root of the problems the Trump team is having: They have spent so much time studying Nixon’s 1968 campaign that they are starting to copy it. Top aide: Trump will channel 1968 Nixon in speech It is hard to believe, but we now know that Trump and his team have come to believe that Richard Nixon’s 1968 convention speech and campaign should serve as their model. There are indeed some parallels between then and now: Nixon was running at a time of turmoil on the streets at home and an agonizing war overseas. Middle class voters were angry. Nixon proclaimed himself to be the law-and-order candidate and as Joe McGinnis records in his classic book, “The Selling of the President,” he skillfully used television to speak over the heads of a querulous press corps to what he called “a silent majority.” Nixon went on to win in a tight election, a lesson the Trump team has taken to heart. Join us on Facebook.com/Opinion. So, it makes sense to study the Nixon years, but it is bizarre beyond words to intentionally choose his candidacy and presidency as a role model. As a young man, I worked for Nixon in the White House and believe he did far more good for the country than is generally appreciated. Yet, even the most loyal Nixonite would acknowledge that his insecurities and paranoia led to a long string of political and legal abuses. He could not control his inner demons and eventually did himself in. In politics, moreover, his “Southern strategy” became an invitation for segregationists, then staunch Democrats, to become Republicans. That was a Faustian bargain that ultimately tore the party away from its Lincolnian roots and haunts it still. DNC chair: Trump campaign has to answer for RNC speech In days ahead, commentators here in Cleveland will hammer Trump over his embrace of Nixon. In a preview of what is likely coming, Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution acidly wrote Tuesday, “But why should anyone be surprised at an instance of plagiarism in a single speech? By Trump’s campaign manager’s own admission, they are plagiarizing the entire campaign from Richard Nixon’s 1968 law and order campaign.” There are surely people around Donald Trump who know all this. But Trump hasn’t invested enough resources to build a first-rate staff around him and after all, they take orders from the top. Trump has every reason to be angry with his team over the Melania speech, but when it comes to the presidency, as Harry Truman pointed out a long time ago, the buck stops with him. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "NEW: Attorney General Loretta Lynch says the Justice Department is suing Ferguson NEW: \"We intend to aggressively prosecute this case,\" she says In a 6-0 vote, Ferguson City Council called for amendments to a deal with the feds The feds are suing Ferguson in a move to force police reform in the city. “We intend to aggressively prosecute this case,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters Wednesday, “and we intend to prevail.” Authorities had no choice but to file a lawsuit after the Ferguson City Council voted Tuesday to change the terms of a deal negotiators had been hashing out for months, Lynch said. “The residents of Ferguson have suffered the deprivation of their constitutional rights, the rights guaranteed to all Americans, for decades. They have waited decades for justice,” Lynch said. “They should not be forced to wait any longer.” The residents of Ferguson should not be forced to wait any longer.  The lawsuit alleges a pattern and practice of unconstitutional police conduct in the city. A city spokesman told  that officials will have no comment about the Justice Department’s lawsuit until Thursday. Ferguson officials have not seen the lawsuit, city spokesman Jeff Small said. Negotiations over reforms to the city’s police force and municipal court system began after a Justice Department investigation last year found the Ferguson Police Department had discriminated against African-Americans, targeting them disproportionately for traffic stops, use of force and jail sentences. “These violations were not only egregious, they were routine. They were encouraged by the city in the interest of raising revenue,” Lynch said Wednesday. “They were driven, at least in part, by racial bias and they occurred disproportionately against African American residents of Ferguson.” City officials last month insisted that their vote wasn’t a rejection of the Justice Department consent decree but rather a push to return to the table because of concerns over the cost of some terms. Lynch said the council knowingly voted against an agreement approved by the city’s own negotiators. “The city was well aware that by deciding not to accept it, they were choosing litigation,” she said. “This was their choice.” In a unanimous vote Tuesday night, council members approved the deal – but only if the Justice Department accepts seven amendments. The Justice Department wasn’t expecting any changes to the negotiated deal and wasted little time in responding. “The Ferguson City Council has attempted to unilaterally amend the negotiated agreement,” Vanita Gupta, head of the agency’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. “Their vote to do so creates an unnecessary delay in the essential work to bring constitutional policing to the city, and marks an unfortunate outcome for concerned community members and Ferguson police officers.” Ferguson protests mark a year of outrage The national spotlight on Ferguson began after the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson in August 2014. Brown, who was unarmed, was black, and Wilson is white. Brown’s death prompted days of protests and riots in Ferguson and a national conversation about the role of race in police interactions with citizens. Reaction to the City Council vote was mixed, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. One activist, Debra Kennedy, called the public hearings “a farce, because the DOJ is not going to go back and renegotiate,” the newspaper reported. “It was like a ‘no’ vote.” Others chanted, “You can’t amend justice,” according to the Post-Dispatch. The agreement was negotiated over seven months. “Although we did not get everything we wanted in the agreement, we certainly made sure that what was agreed upon can be implemented in a timely and sufficient manner,” Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III said of the consent decree the city received January 26. “We’re not trying to take away any safeguards,” Knowles told  affiliate KMOV. “We’re not trying to take away anything substantive out of the decree.” City Councilwoman Ella James agreed. “There are some things in the consent decree that we’re asking to be amended, but all in all I think we’re moving forward, we’re moving in a positive direction,” she told  affiliate KTVI. The consent decree requires the city to hire additional senior staff dedicated to the implementation of the deal and in areas such as crisis intervention and community-police relations. Other costs to the city of Ferguson would include the creation of an electronic complaint tracking system, an early intervention system and training throughout various levels of the police department. Ferguson reacts to grand jury decision Brown’s parents filed a wrongful death suit against the city in April. • That it contains no mandate for the payment of additional salary to police or other city employees. • That it contains no mandate for staffing at the city’s jail. • That the deadlines set forth are extended. • That the terms do not apply to other agencies that take over services currently provided by the city. • That a provision for local preference in contractors and consultants is included. • That goals for minority and women participation in consulting, oversight and third-party services are included. • That monitoring fee caps are changed to $1 million over the first five years and no more than $250,000 in any single year. Spirited public input preceded Tuesday night’s vote. “Black lives matter! Black lives matter!” chanted one community member. Another suggested it was time to wrap up this chapter in the city’s history. “It’s time to stop. Just go and sign the decree. You still haven`t settled the Mike Brown settlement,” he said. “Get it done. Just sign it.” Brown’s parents filed a wrongful death suit against the city in April. A 102-page report issued by the Justice Department last March said some Ferguson police officers saw residents as “sources of revenue,” leading to practices that federal investigators said disproportionately targeted black residents. It also found evidence of racist jokes sent by some Ferguson police officers and court officials. The department made 26 recommendations, including: Ferguson police provide training to ensure officers aren’t using bias in policing; officers practice community policing by getting out of cars and getting to know communities; focus police stops, searches and ticketing on protecting the public, as opposed to fund-raising for the city. • Ferguson police provide training to ensure officers aren’t using bias in policing. • Officers practice community policing by getting out of cars and getting to know communities. • Focus police stops, searches and ticketing on protecting the public, as opposed to fund-raising for the city. In March, The Justice Department declined to bring civil rights charges against Wilson in Brown’s death. Justice Department investigators concluded Brown was moving toward the officer when Wilson fired. A grand jury also declined to indict Wilson, who left the force in November 2014. ’s Sara Sidner, Dani Stewart and Sheena Jones contributed to this report. © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "President Barack Obama will nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court Senate Republicans have said they will not hold a hearing on the nomination Garland, 63, the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has been on short lists before President Barack Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland, who is respected across political lines, to the Supreme Court Wednesday, in an epic power play targeting the resolve of Republicans who have vowed to block any replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia until a new president takes office. GOP leaders, caught in the undertow of an election in which the conservative grass-roots are already in revolt, immediately renewed their refusal to consider Garland, 63, saying their reservations were not personal but motivated by a desire for the American people to weigh in on Scalia’s replacement. The showdown is even more fraught than most Supreme Court fights, since Obama’s choice could tilt the ideological balance of the court away from conservatives – possibly for years. Who is Merrick Garland? In a speech in the evocative ceremonial surroundings of the White House Rose Garden, Obama praised Garland as “one of America’s sharpest legal minds,” making a case that he was so eminently qualified for the job in terms of legal learning, experience and temperament that any attempt to ignore his appointment could only be the result of base political motivations. “I have selected a nominee who is widely recognized not only as one of America’s sharpest legal minds, but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency modesty, integrity, evenhandedness and excellence,” Obama said. These qualities and his long commitment to public service have earned him the respect and admiration from leaders from both sides of the aisle.” Senate Republicans do not plan to vet or have hearings on Garland, let alone a vote on his nomination. Obama and Democrats argue that with 10 months left in his term, there is plenty of time for the Senate to take up and confirm a new justice. The gravity of Obama’s announcement on Wednesday was part of an attempt to pressure Republicans, especially senators with an eye on their own legacies or those who face tough re-election fights, to peel away from their leadership. Mitch McConnell responds to Supreme Court nomination But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the GOP chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, have both expressed little leeway in their determination to forgo hearings for Obama’s nominee. “The American people may well elect a president who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration,” McConnell said Wednesday. “The next president may also nominate someone very different. Either way, our view is this: Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy.” McConnell spoke with Garland this afternoon by phone. “Rather than put Judge Garland through more unnecessary political routines orchestrated by the White House, the leader decided it would be more considerate of the nominee’s time to speak with him today by phone,” McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said. “And since the Senate will not be acting on this nomination, he would not be holding a perfunctory meeting, but he wished Judge Garland well.” Garland, the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has been on short lists before. An appointee of President Bill Clinton, Garland is a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School. As a Justice Department lawyer, he supervised investigations in the Unabomber case as well as the Oklahoma City bombing. His voice cracking with emotion, Garland called Obama’s decision to nominate him “the greatest honor of my life.” “For me, their could be no higher public service than serving as a member of the Supreme Court,” Garland said. Obama’s announcement amplifies the ongoing political battle over the precedent and propriety of considering a Supreme Court nomination amid a heated presidential election. Trump on Supreme Court: ‘The next president should make the pick’ The announcement comes after a big night in the 2016 election, with both party’s front-runners – Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump – emerging with sweeping victories as they march toward their respective nominations. Some believed Obama would time his pick so it wouldn’t get lost in a news cycle dominated by election results. But the timing seems suited to directly insert the selection into the political conversation. Fueling the argument is the potential for the first shift in the court’s ideological leaning in two decades. If confirmed, Obama’s nominee will likely offer a vastly different legal outlook that Scalia, who was considered one of the court’s most conservative members.  senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the pick of Garland, who is well-respected in legal circles “takes the issue of qualifications off the table,” but noted the fight now is all about politics.” “He is the chief judge of the second most important court in the country, but the political calculation here is, I think, quite clear,” Toobin said. “President Obama is saying to the Senate Republicans, you can take my 63-year-old now or wait for President Hillary Clinton to bring up a 45-year-old in 10 months.” At 63, Garland is much older than the other contenders on the short list such as Judges Sri Srinivasan, Paul Watford and Jane Kelly. Garland’s supporters argue he is the nominee that the senators couldn’t refuse even in a contentious environment. Obama: I'm looking for a 'consensus' SCOTUS candidate Obama had said his goal was to find a “consensus candidate.” “It is my intention to nominate somebody who has impeccable credentials, somebody who should be a consensus candidate,” Obama told  en Español anchor Juan Carlos Lopez in an interview last week. This is Obama’s third nomination to the high court. Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed in 2009 and 2010, respectively. But those confirmation hearings and votes occurred when Democrats were firmly in control of the Senate. Democrats have already begun a campaign to pressure Republicans into considering Obama’s nomination. In their sights: vulnerable senators up for reelection, some of whom are already facing backlash from opponents for refusing to consider even a hypothetical Obama nominee. The White House launched a Twitter account, @SCOTUSnom, designed to promote the nomination as well. How to get instantly verified on Twitter: Be Barack Obama But while some moderate Republicans have expressed willingness to meet with the nominee, their ability to force hearings before the full judiciary panel appear slim. A McConnell aide said noted the Kentucky senator voted against Garland when he was confirmed to the appeals court in 1997 and argued Obama’s choice is a recognition that this pick not getting through – otherwise the President would have picked a younger nominee who would serve longer. Sen. Pat Roberts, one of seven current Republicans to vote for Garland in 1997, told  he will not back the judge now. “It’s not about the person. It’s about the process. Let the people decide,” Roberts said. Asked why he voted for Garland previously, Roberts replied, “I supported him.” Trump said he agrees with the stance of the Hill Republicans. “I think the next president should make the pick. And I think they shouldn’t go forward. And I believe I’m pretty much in line with what the Republicans are saying,” Trump told ’s Chris Cuomo Wednesday on “New Day.” Toobin said it will be difficult for them to change tactics now. “I don’t see how at this point they can go back on this promise,” not to move on the nominee, Toobin said Wednesday morning. Polls show most Americans support giving a nominee a congressional hearing. A /ORC survey taken late last month indicated sizable majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents want Senate Republican leaders to hold hearings on the nominee. The complete /ORC poll on the Supreme Court nominations Grassley last week said the Senate retained a prerogative to forgo hearings for Obama’s selection. “It isn’t any different if the President of the United States notifies Congress well in advance of a piece of legislation that he’s going to veto it,” Grassley said at a Judiciary panel hearing, citing criticism from Republicans over the role of the high court. “Whether it’s today or tomorrow or whether it’s for the next seven or eight months, this is a very important debate that we ought to have about the Constitution and about not only who’s going to be a replacement for Justice Scalia but about the role of the Supreme Court,” he added. “At the grassroots of America, there’s a real feeling of ‘Is the Supreme Court doing what the Constitution requires?’” The announcement comes 32 days after Scalia’s death, only slightly longer than it took him to name his two previous appointments to the high court. Unlike his nominations of Sotomayor and Kagan, the vacancy this time wasn’t expected. White House officials have said they weren’t anticipating another Supreme Court nomination during Obama’s term ahead of Scalia’s death. Obama oversaw a team led by his counsel Neil Eggleston, chief of staff Denis McDonough, and his senior adviser Brian Deese to select and vet a group of potential nominees. After conducting interviews last week, Obama narrowed his list to include Merrick, Watford and Srinivasan, each of them considered “consensus” candidates for their history in gaining confirmation support from Republicans. Any replacement of Scalia has the power to tilt the ideological balance of the court for decades, something conservatives are using to move their base to hold the line. “This seat could be transformational to the court because Justice Scalia’s fidelity to the Constitution was a real anchor for the court. If he were replaced by an Obama nominee that would give the court a solid five votes for enacting an extremely liberal agenda that the American people will not be comfortable with,” Carrie Severino, of Judicial Crisis Network , a conservative group opposed to any candidate getting a hearing until after the election. It would shift the court –that is somewhat balanced –to a liberal stronghold. She is a former clerk of Justice Clarence Thomas. Since Scalia’s death and for the foreseeable future, the court has operated with eight justices, four appointed by Democrats and four by Republicans. Justices have been considering several major cases, including a challenge to public sector unions, a race-conscious admissions plan at the University of Texas, the first big abortion case since 2007, challenges to voting rights, the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate and a challenge to Obama’s executive actions on immigration. Scalia’s death means not only the loss of the court’s main conservative voice but also increases the likelihood of a 4-4 split on controversial issues. If the court is equally divided in a case, ruling 4-4, it means the lower court opinion stands and there is no precedent set by the Supreme Court. ’s Ted Barrett, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Evan Perez, Tom LoBianco and Dan Berman contributed to this report © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Jeb Bush said that Democrats win black voters with 'free stuff' The comment echoed criticism from Mitt Romney in 2012, when he said Barack Obama won minorities with \"gifts\" Jeb Bush told a South Carolina crowd Thursday that Democrats play to African-American voters by offering “free stuff,” a similar comment to a contentious one that Mitt Romney made in the days after his 2012 loss to President Barack Obama. Bush, analyzing Republicans’ chances with black voters, said that his party needs to make a better case to the traditionally Democratic voting bloc. “Our message is one of hope and aspiration. It isn’t one of division and ‘Get in line and we’ll take care of you with free stuff,’” Bush said Thursday at an event in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. It was similar to a Romney comment three years ago, in the days after his 2012 loss, where the former Massachusetts governor blamed the outcome, on a call with donors, on Obama’s “gifts” for minority voters. “What the president, president’s campaign did was focus on certain members of his base coalition, give them extraordinary financial gifts from the government, and then work very aggressively to turn them out to vote,” Romney said at the time, according to audio obtained by ABC News. Other Republicans quickly denounced Romney’s comments and party leaders, as part of their assessment of how to win in 2016, determined that they needed to do a better job reaching out to minorities. A Bush spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a  request for comment Friday, but declined to address the “free stuff” phrase directly in a reply to The New York Times. “We will never be successful in elections without communicating that conservative principles and conservative policies are the only path to restoring the right to rise for every single American,” Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told the Times. RELATED: Jeb Bush defends attacks against ‘multiculturalism’ Bush’s “free stuff” comment came as he explained another comment, from Tuesday, that the U.S. should not be a “multicultural” society. “We’re a pluralistic society. We’re diverse, we have people that come from everywhere,” Bush told reporters Thursday. “We’re not multicultural. We have a set of shared values that defines our national identity, and we should never veer away from that because that creates the extraordinary nature of our country.” © 2021 Cable News Network.

        "articles": "Stein's disdain for the Democratic Party is key to her campaign She welcomes collaboration with Sanders There’s an independent senator – a democratic socialist, no less – with climate change on the brain making a real play for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton, who exudes establishment politics. What’s the Green Party, which has been railing against the Democratic Party for years, to do in the year of Bernie Sanders? For Jill Stein, 2012 Green Party presidential nominee and current candidate, the answer seems to be keep on going. “Forward movement is a good thing, but I always include that it’s not enough, and we have to have a base where we can truly build,” Stein told . “That cannot be done inside of the corporate, establishment political parties.” Stein’s third party bid for the presidency is centered on student debt, climate change and opposition to the economic and political establishment – also focal points for the Sanders campaign, a similarity Stein readily acknowledged. Sanders, Clinton spar over Wall Street ties “I think we share very similar values and visions,” Stein said. “I just happen to be working in a party that supports those values and those visions.” Sanders has made changing the Democratic Party a key pitch to his voters. Stein’s disdain for the Democratic Party is key to hers. “I have long since thrown in the towel on the Democratic and Republican parties because they are really a front group for the 1%, for predatory banks, fossil fuel giants and war profiteers,” Stein said. Clinton: ‘I’m not even sure’ Sanders is a Democrat Stein had many positive words for the Sanders campaign but said he was constrained by a political party with a history of coopting progressive campaigns. “The party allows progressive faces to sort of be their figurehead for a little while, but while it does that, while it sort of fakes left, the party continues to march toward the right,” Stein told . Stein said the Democratic Party, along with the Republican Party, represented corporate interests and has not allowed progressives to take charge. The story she told of the Democratic Party was one of a party that had used its “kill switch,” in the form of packed primary days, like Super Tuesday, and super delegates, to take down “very good and principled campaigns” over the decades. These progressive campaigns “are invariably sabotaged by the (Democratic) party,” she said. She cited the Democratic Party’s changing of nomination rules following George McGovern’s 1972 bid as well as the failures of Jesse Jackson, Howard Dean and Dennis Kucinich. She predicted a similar fate for the Sanders campaign, which she said had nevertheless “elevated the debate enormously.” “I think the Democratic Party is going to cut them off at the path, and then maybe it will fall to our campaign to be the Plan B for Bernie’s supporters,” Stein said. In 2012 when Stein last ran for the presidency, she garnered almost 470,000 votes, or .36 percent of the popular vote, according to the FEC. The Green Party’s high water mark was Ralph Nader’s 2000 run, where he got nearly 3% of the vote nationwide. Although she split with Sanders on a number of major issues, she welcomed the opportunity for the two candidates to collaborate. “The Green Party has been trying to contact Bernie Sanders since 2011 through emails, paper letters and phone calls,” Stein said. “We approached him about a potential collaboration in 2012 race and again before this race actually.” Stein said her invitations to collaborate have received “no response whatsoever” from Sanders. “He’s a team player, and he believes in the Democratic Party, so I have to respect that,” Stein said. “He believes in the establishment, in the political establishment. He’s been in Washington a long time. He caucuses with the Democrats.” The Sanders campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this article. John McAfee still thinks ‘this is the year of the third party’ 2000: What stopped Gore from going on stage Stein said she does not believe the Democratic Party can or will bring about the kind of revolution she, and Sanders, have called for. “It (the Democratic Party) hasn’t been winning for the agenda that Bernie Sanders supports, but he’s very afraid of splitting the vote,” Stein said. By “splitting the vote,” Stein was referring to a belief she said many Democrats have that third party candidacies bolster those they most oppose. For example, some said Ralph Nader, who ran as the Green Party candidate and got 2.74 percent of the vote, helped George W. Bush defeat Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election – an assessment Nader rejected. Stein said any worry over a potential third party spoiler effect could fixed through voting reform. “We could fix that in the blink of an eye with a simple voting reform called rank choice voting that allows people to rank their choices,” she said. Although she welcomed collaboration with Sanders, she had few positive words for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Asked if Clinton was, in her view, a progressive, Stein laughed and said, “No, not in the least. This is Goldman Sachs’ best friend.” First & last Democratic debates were totally different Stein offered a litany of Clinton’s failures to live up to the Green Party’s standards, from the former secretary of state’s Wall Street speeches to her record on foreign policy, international trade, fracking and many other issues. “In what way exactly is she progressive?” Stein asked. “There’s a very long and consistent track record on the part of Hillary Clinton, and it’s not been favorable to women, to children, to the cause of peace, justice and a sustainable climate,” Stein said. © 2021 Cable News Network.
