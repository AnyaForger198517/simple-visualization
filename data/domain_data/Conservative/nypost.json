In a pre-primary bombshell, the city’s Board of Elections was pummeled with questions Monday about how 54,000 Democratic voters vanished from the rolls in Brooklyn. The voter rolls on April 1 showed the borough had 853,687 registered Democrats who are considered “active” because they voted at least once in the last four years. But in November, there were 917,508, or 63,558 more. The board said the numbers changed because many once-active voters were moved to the inactive list. But that list grew by only 9,154 voters — from 82,807 to 91,961 — leaving 54,404 Brooklyn voters missing. Voters on the inactive list can still cast a ballot if they live in the city. But the “missing” voters are out of luck — their names have been stricken from the records. Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was “confused” by the discrepancy and would seek an explanation. “I’ve asked already today for an analysis of this from the Board of Elections,” the mayor said. Bertha Lewis, director of the Black Institute, called for an investigation. “There needs to be a probe. We know that 300K-plus have been purged without explanation,” she said. Brooklyn Councilman Brad Lander called the purge “weird” and “troubling.” Board of Elections Executive Director Michael Ryan said the mystery is easily explained: Because of retirements and staff illness, the voting list was not properly maintained in Brooklyn for six to eight months. When staffers caught up with the backlog, he said, they purged voters who should have been removed earlier last year. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Sometime this week, President Obama is scheduled to sign an executive order to meet the Oct. 15 “adoption day” he has set for the nuclear deal he says he has made with Iran. According to the president’s timetable the next step would be “the start day of implementation,” fixed for Dec. 15. But as things now stand, Obama may end up being the only person in the world to sign his much-wanted deal, in effect making a treaty with himself. The Iranians have signed nothing and have no plans for doing so. The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) has not even been discussed at the Islamic Republic’s Council of Ministers. Nor has the Tehran government bothered to even provide an official Persian translation of the 159-page text. The Islamic Majlis, the ersatz parliament, is examining an unofficial text and is due to express its views at an unspecified date in a document “running into more than 1,000 pages,” according to Mohsen Zakani, who heads the “examining committee.” “The changes we seek would require substantial rewriting of the text,” he adds enigmatically. Nor have Britain, China, Germany, France and Russia, who were involved in the so-called P5+1 talks that produced the JCPOA, deemed it necessary to provide the Obama “deal” with any legal basis of their own. Obama’s partners have simply decided that the deal he is promoting is really about lifting sanctions against Iran and nothing else. So they have started doing just that without bothering about JCPOA’s other provisions. Britain has lifted the ban on 22 Iranian banks and companies blacklisted because of alleged involvement in deals linked to the nuclear issue. German trade with Iran has risen by 33 percent, making it the Islamic Republic’s third-largest partner after China. China has signed preliminary accords to help Iran build five more nuclear reactors. Russia has started delivering S300 anti-aircraft missile systems and is engaged in talks to sell Sukhoi planes to the Islamic Republic. France has sent its foreign minister and a 100-man delegation to negotiate big business deals, including projects to double Iran’s crude oil exports. Other nations have also interpreted JCPOA as a green light for dropping sanctions. Indian trade with Iran has risen by 17 percent, and New Delhi is negotiating massive investment in a rail-and-sea hub in the Iranian port of Chah-Bahar on the Gulf of Oman. With help from Austrian, Turkish and United Arab Emirates banks, the many banking restrictions imposed on Iran because of its nuclear program have been pushed aside. “The structures of sanctions built over decades is crumbling,” boasts Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Meanwhile, the nuclear project is and shall remain “fully intact,” says the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Agency, Ali Akbar Salehi. “We have started working on a process of nuclear fusion that will be cutting-edge technology for the next 50 years,” he adds. Even before Obama’s “implementation day,” the mullahs are receiving an average of $400 million a month, no big sum, but enough to ease the regime’s cash-flow problems and increase pay for its repressive forces by around 21 percent. Last month, Iran and the P5+1 created a joint commission to establish the modalities of implementation of an accord, a process they wish to complete by December 2017 when the first two-year review of JCPOA is scheduled to take place and when Obama will no longer be in the White House. (If things go awry Obama could always blame his successor or even George W Bush.) Both Obama and his Secretary of State John Kerry have often claimed that, its obvious shortcomings notwithstanding, their nuke deal with the “moderate faction” in Tehran might encourage positive changes in Iran’s behavior. That hasn’t happened. The mullahs see the “deal” as a means with which Obama would oppose any suggestion of trying to curb Iran. “Obama won’t do anything that might jeopardize the deal,” says Ziba Kalam, a Rouhani adviser. “This is his biggest, if not the only, foreign policy success.” If there have been changes in Tehran’s behavior they have been for the worst. Iran has teamed up with Russia to keep Bashar al-Assad in power in Syria, mocking Obama’s “Assad must go” rhetoric. More importantly, Iran has built its direct military presence in Syria to 7,000 men. (One of Iran’s most senior generals was killed in Aleppo on Wednesday.) Tehran has also pressured Iraqi Premier Haidar al-Abadi’s weak government to distance itself from Washington and join a dubious coalition with Iran, Russia and Syria. Certain that Obama is paralyzed by his fear of undermining the non-existent “deal” the mullahs have intensified their backing for Houthi rebels in Yemen. Last week a delegation was in Tehran with a long shopping list for arms. In Lebanon, the mullahs have toughened their stance on choosing the country’s next president. And in Bahrain, Tehran is working on a plan to “ensure an early victory” of the Shiite revolution in the archipelago. Confident that Obama is determined to abandon traditional allies of the United States, Tehran has also heightened propaganda war against Saudi Arabia, now openly calling for the overthrow of the monarchy there. The mullahs are also heightening contacts with Palestinian groups in the hope of unleashing a new “Intifada.” “Palestine is thirsty for a third Intifada,” Supreme Guide Khamenei’s mouthpiece Kayhan said in an editorial last Thursday. “It is the duty of every Muslim to help start it as soon as possible.” Obama’s hopes of engaging Iran on other issues were dashed last week when Khamenei declared “any dialogue with the American Great Satan” to be” forbidden.” “We have no need of America” his adviser Ali-Akbar Velayati added later. “Iran is the region’s big power in its own right.” Obama had hoped that by sucking up to the mullahs he would at least persuade them to moderate their “hate-America campaign.” Not a bit of that. “Death to America” slogans, adoring official buildings in Tehran have been painted afresh along with US flags, painted at the entrance of offices so that they could be trampled underfoot. None of the US citizens still held hostages in Iran has been released, and one, Washington Post stringer Jason Rezai, is branded as “head of a spy ring “in Tehran. Paralyzed by his fear of undermining the non-existent deal, Obama doesn’t even call for their release. Government-sponsored anti-American nationwide events are announced for November, anniversary of the seizure of the US Embassy in Tehran. The annual “End of America” week-long conference is planned for February and is to focus on “African-American victims of US police” and the possibility of “self-determination for blacks.” According to official sources “families of Black American victims” and a number of “black American revolutionaries” have been invited. Inside Iran, Obama’s “moderate partners” have doubled the number of executions and political prisoners. Last week they crushed marches by teachers calling for release of their leaders. Hundreds of trade unionists have been arrested and a new “anti-insurrection” brigade paraded in Tehran to terrorize possible protestors. The Obama deal may end up as the biggest diplomatic scam in recent history. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Bernie Sanders’ team is pressing the Democratic Party to do something it’s never before done: adopt an official party platform plank referring to Israeli “occupation” of the West Bank. It would mark yet another significant step in Democrats’ growing abandonment of their historic support of Israel dating back to President Harry Truman. Then again, Sanders’ hand-picked members of the platform committee make no bones about wanting exactly that. At a recent committee hearing, Cornel West charged that the Democrats have “been beholden to AIPAC” — the pro-Israel lobbying group — “for too long.” Yes, Hillary Clinton’s supporters pushed back. Ex-Rep. Robert Wexler, for one, insisted the platform isn’t the place to litigate the Middle East conflict. But it’s telling that he made a procedural argument, rather than face the Israel-bashers’ charges head-on. The final call may not be up to Clinton — not judging by what went on four years ago. That’s when the convention chair had to resort to outright subterfuge to reinstate a clause (dropped by the platform committee) declaring Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital. On several votes, delegates loudly booed down the motion to restore the traditional language — before the chair just declared it passed, when it clearly hadn’t. A party’s platform is its official declaration of its stances. And the Democratic platform has never used the word “occupation.” Clinton surely would love for this all to go away quietly. But polls show liberal Democrats are now more pro-Palestinian than pro-Israeli. If it comes to a floor fight, will she stand up for principle and demand the delegates oppose the Israel-bashers? Or will party leaders again just ignore the actual votes so they can pretend Democrats haven’t turned against the Jewish state? Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. What did he know and when did he know it? The immortal question about Richard Nixon and Water­gate should be posed to Barack Obama about Syria. What and when did he know about Vladimir Putin’s axis-of-evil coalition? The significance is not limited to Syria. The question goes to the heart of the Iran nuclear deal, especially the timing of the congressional votes. Imagine Obama trying to sell the Iran deal now. With Russia, Iran and Iraq working together to muscle the United States aside and defend Bashar al-Assad, the president couldn’t possibly argue that the nuke deal would help stabilize the Middle East. Nor could he argue that Russia could be trusted to help enforce ­restrictions on Iran. The strong likelihood that Obama would have lost the Iran vote if Congress knew then what the world knows now suggests the possibility the president concealed the Russian plan until the Iran deal was done. That view fits with his single-minded determination to get a deal at any price, including making key concessions and downplaying Iranian threats to Israel and the United States. After all that, what’s another lie? That view is also supported by the chronology, which reveals strong evidence the president hid the truth. For much of September, reports of Russia moving soldiers and military equipment into Syria invariably said the Pentagon was “puzzled” or the White House was “unclear” about Putin’s intent. Obama declared on Sept. 11 that whatever the dictator’s plan, it was “doomed to fail.” The claims of fuzziness about Syria allowed Obama to keep the focus on his push to sell the Iran pact to Congress. He touted Russia’s support, vowed to impose “snapback” sanctions if Iran cheated and said he would work to stop the mullahs’ ­regional aggressions. His arguments and arm-twisting kept 42 Senate Democrats in line, enough to save the deal. Yet soon ­after opponents lost their final vote, on Sept. 17, Russia revealed that it would lead a coalition of Iran and Iraq to intervene militarily to save the Assad regime. The shock-and-awe attacks launched last week are rattling the world as Russian airstrikes pound Syrian rebels, including some we support, with Iraq and Iran providing boots on the ground. But it’s not possible that nobody in Washington saw this coming. After all, the Russian plan took shape well before late September. The Iran deal was officially finalized on July 14, and Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani met with Putin in Russia on July 24. Fox News, which first reported the meeting, even had the flight numbers of Soleimani’s Iran Air flights between Moscow and Tehran. Soleimani, banned from international travel because of links to terrorism, earlier had been spotted in Iraq, helping to defend Assad against Islamic State. Yet five days after Soleimani was in Moscow, Secretary of State John Kerry told the Senate the travel restrictions against Soleimani would never be lifted. Apparently, they would never be enforced, either. Although Russia and Iran had separately supported Assad, Kerry never mentioned that they could be working together militarily. Yet the Institute for the Study of War, a respected think tank, reported that “available satellite imagery and open sources” showed that “the new buildup of Russian military forces in Syria began in July 2015 and accelerated considerably in late August and September.” That means the buildup began near the Soleimani visit to Putin. The institute offered key details, including that in late August, a Russian ship unloaded armored personnel carriers. It cited another report from Syrian rebels that Russian-speaking soldiers were engaged in combat against Assad’s opponents. Yet in early September, less than two weeks before the final Iran vote, Kerry still wondered whether the buildup reports were “accurate.” That ridiculous feint would soon morph to an acknowledgment of a buildup, but with convenient claims that nobody understood Putin’s intent. Now, of course, everybody understands Putin’s intent and is alarmed because the war is widening and Russia has replaced the United States as the region’s top power broker, a blow to our national security and allies. But there still is little understanding of the connection between this tectonic shift and the Iranian nuclear deal. In fact, the deal was the final piece that put the Syria plan into action. By eliminating most sanctions and freeing Iranian assets, the nuke deal provides money and protection for the world’s largest sponsor of terrorism to attack our allies. And Iran’s liberation gave Putin the Muslim ground troops he needs. So the question needs to be asked of Barack Hussein Nixon: What did you know, and when did you know it? Top aides are locked in a bitter battle over one of the most important issues in New York, so what does Mayor Putz do? He punts and heads out of town. On the same day Police Commissioner Bill Bratton announced reforms to use-of-force guidelines, the NYPD’s inspector general released a study of incidents and said Bratton’s reforms fall short. The IG, Philip Eure, accused the department of being “in the dark ages” compared to other cities. A furious Bratton demanded an apology, but got none. At that point, a mayor who is a leader and who understands the difficulty of police work would have stepped in to defend his commissioner and his troops. No surprise, de Blasio is not that mayor. While he repeatedly praised Bratton, the Putz ducked and weaved when asked Friday about Eure’s outrageous “dark ages” remark. “It’s not surprising that the inspector general has an opinion,” de Blasio told an interviewer. It’s not surprising that de Blasio is a wimp, either. He’s a fair-weather friend to cops, in their corner until something goes wrong or a charge is leveled. Then he checks to see which way the wind is blowing, or which way Al Sharpton is leaning. The pattern is fixed, but this case is no mere difference of opinion. The city should speak with one voice on such a crucial topic, and if de Blasio can’t stand with the cops, he ought to stay out of town. It’s unanimous. Obama, Gov. Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio all denounced the “gun violence” in the Oregon slaughter — and all failed to mention that Christians were singled out for murder. Would they have been silent on religion if the dead were Muslims? The question answers itself. Whatever their personal faith, leading Democrats believe in only one politically correct religion. It’s impossible to count Hillary Clinton’s lies about her e-mail scandal, but here’s a handy shortcut. Despite her claim that there was “no classified material” on her home-brew server, officials found 400 e-mails they now consider classified, even if they weren’t marked at the time. Because Clinton was required to safeguard sensitive information, that makes 400 lies in one sentence. Even for her, that’s gotta be a record. Guinness! Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. If the stock market is worried about the President Trump getting impeached it has a funny way of showing it: The Dow, the S&P and Nasdaq set new records Monday, buoyed by strong corporate earnings, a possible trade deal and the wide-spread belief among sophisticated investors that the US economy will continue to chug along handsomely. Despite what you hear from doomsayers like the newly minted Dem front-runner Elizabeth Warren, the rising Trump economy is raising all boats, not just the fat cats on Wall Street. At least that’s what the people who have money in the game are saying, and their word counts a lot more than any leftist politician. Of course, even in the best of times — and according to the data we are pretty close to them now with unemployment hovering at a 50-year-low of 3.6 percent — there are things to worry about. Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping may not reach their long-coveted trade deal. Sluggish business investment (which declined in the last quarter by an annualized rate of 3 percent after a 1 percent decline) could get even more sluggish, sending the modest economic growth of 1.9 percent in the past quarter into the red. Wages are growing better than the dog-days of the Obama presidency, but growth has tapered off recently (to 3 percent in October) suggesting employers aren’t that worried about a tightening labor market and they’re slowing the pace of new hires. Meanwhile, the impeachment hearings could batter and bruise Trump so much that even an economic arsonist like Elizabeth Warren could slip through the electoral cracks and become president despite her fantastical utopian ideas of handing free stuff to everyone except wealth creators, who of course, she will tax so much they will stop creating any wealth. More likely is that the current economy — which is strong and with a little luck likely to get stronger — will make Trump formidable in 2020. The US economy grew nearly 2 percent last quarter, powered largely by continued strength of consumer spending, which grew solidly by 2.9 percent. People don’t generally spend money unless they’re feeling pretty good about their economic future, and you need more than the top 1 percent feeling good to accrue consumer spending growth like we now have. In other words, the rich may be getting richer in the Trump economy, but so are most others. Again, look at the numbers. I can’t wait for Warren & Co., to explain black unemployment, which has remained at record lows for the past three months. Yes, more needs to be done; black unemployment rate is at 5.4 percent compared to the overall 3.6 percent rate, but only a fool would argue that these numbers (possibly the biggest economic achievement of the Trump presidency) aren’t heading in the right direction, which is why for all of Warren’s class-warfare posturing, she has steered clear of them. Keep in mind all this progress on the economy has been taking place in the face of prolonged business uncertainly as Trump fights his trade war with China. The president maintains he has good reasons to take on China’s abusive trade practices — from the theft of intellectual property to the uneven playing field faced by US companies doing business in the mainland — and he might have a point. But there was an economic consequence to the tit-for-tat tariffs China and the US has been imposing on each other. As Trump and Xi move closer to ending the hostilities, the headache of uncertainty will be at the minimum removed. If they reach a decent deal allowing the likes of Chinese telecom company Huawei to have access to US markets, while US companies can have the same access to Chinese consumers, the economic benefits from both countries will be enormous. I don’t know about you, but to me, a trade deal seems a lot more important for the markets, the economy and Trump’s re-election chances than some impeachment vote. And the best minds on Wall Street appear to agree. Charles Gasparino is a Fox Business senior correspondent. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Since losing the most winnable presidential election in modern American history, Hillary Clinton has, among other things: given a series of high-profile speeches, joined Gov. Cuomo at his public unveiling of tuition-free college, refused to rule out a run for mayor of New York and issued an online video message exhorting fellow Democrats to fight on in her name. “The challenges we face,” she said, “as a country and a party, are real.” Clearly, Hillary still sees herself as the leader of the Democratic Party. And why shouldn’t she? Democrats have been locked in an abusive relationship with the Clintons for decades, enabling, explaining, convincing themselves that next time will be different. Party faithful hew to Hillary’s excuses for losing to Donald Trump: It’s James Comey’s fault, plus the Russians, white supremacists, misogynists, the deplorables and immobilized millennials, among other things. Her losses in 2008 and 2016 have been framed as things that happened to Hillary — not one, but two Black Swan events that stymied her historic destiny. How is it that Democrats have fealty here, let alone sympathy? How is it that Hillary routinely walks into standing ovations at Broadway theaters? Where is the realization that Hillary is to blame or the rational rejection of a two-time loser? Any debate about what happened last November ends with Tuesday’s publication of “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign.” Journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes spent the past two years talking to Hillary’s most trusted advisers, and what emerges is damning. Every mistake made in her 2008 run was compounded in 2016: the paranoia, the staff infighting, the underestimation of the intra-party wild card, the self-righteousness, the failure to connect with average voters, the belief that because it was her turn the presidency would be hers. It’s “Groundhog Day” with global consequences. According to “Shattered,” after a year spent crisscrossing the country, “Hillary still couldn’t figure out why Americans were so angry.” Jon Favreau, Obama’s favorite speechwriter, lasted with Hillary mere weeks, quitting before she even formally announced. She has no clear reason for running, Favreau told her staff. She has no clear vision for the country and can’t answer two simple questions: Why her, and why now? By late 2015, Hillary told an aide she still had no idea what voters needed. “I’m really trying to put my finger on what the electorate, the Democratic primary electorate, the broader electorate is thinking and feeling right now.” By then, the US economy had been decimated for seven years. Unemployment was stagnant, with 7.5 million Americans without work. One of every 122 homes had been foreclosed. More than 33,000 Americans died as a result of the opioid epidemic. An average of 20 veterans committed suicide per day. There was no shortage of issues. Where is the realization that Hillary is to blame or the rational rejection of a two-time loser? Similarly, Hillary didn’t get why Bernie Sanders was resonating. Her worst defenses kicked in, fertilized by her top aides. “From the Clinton campaign’s perspective,” the authors write, Bernie “was getting an even easier ride from the media than Obama had in 2008.” Hillary’s Twitter feed indicates that she’s learned nothing. She posts about social issues and identity politics through the prism of her loss. She remains woefully out of touch and she still doesn’t get what her husband did way back in 1992: It’s the economy, stupid. Unless deprived of oxygen, Hillary and her cohort will press on, further retarding party progress. Stars such as Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand are fighting for column inches, airtime and party dominance as the Clintons stubbornly remain. Two weeks ago, reports surfaced that Huma Abedin, long viewed by Hillary’s top aides as a major liability, is shopping a $2 million tell-all. Given that the book has Hillary’s blessing, and that Abedin’s husband, Anthony Weiner, remains under federal investigation for child pornography — and that she’s still married to Anthony Weiner — who really thinks she’s going to spill anything? It smacks of Abedin’s environment: another grubby Clinton-style cash grab, promising something she’ll never deliver. Chelsea Clinton, meanwhile, is reportedly being groomed for a congressional seat and this week appeared on the cover of Variety as a “Woman of Power.” She’s never looked happier, and she’s never attempted to look so hip, outfitted in jeans, a white T-shirt and black leather jacket. Who could she be hoping to reach? “This is not the time to be silent or stay on the sidelines,” Chelsea said. In true Clintonian mixed-messaging, she’s ruling out a run for office while continuing to raise her profile, offering policy-free platitudes to heartbroken Dems. “Talk about what’s really at risk in this moment,” she said. “Raise your voice and help others raise their voices.” It’s a version of her mother’s intransigence, the refusal to admit voters have rejected this brand twice and to act with resultant humility. According to “Shattered,” Hillary’s repeated refusal to apologize for anything — most notably the use of her private server while secretary of state — was one of her most frustrating faults. Her closest aides kept pushing early on for a sincere apology to the American people, but Hillary remained defiant. In fact, the only time her aides heard Hillary apologize was on election night, after her loss was indisputable. Even then, President Obama had to urge her to concede. “Mr. President,” Hillary said, “I’m sorry.” It’s an apology Hillary owes her supporters, who have stuck through two ostensible “sure-thing” runs for president. And then Hillary and the would-be Clinton dynasty should do the right thing and just go — before the party, like the weary American electorate, is forced to show them the door. Share Selection",

CHARLOTTE, NC — Two hours after getting drunk on the rhetorical moonshine served up by Bill Clinton Wednesday night, delegates and hacks won’t stop believin’ there’s a decent place to get a real drink in this dismal Southern burg. We’re stumbling thirstily along South Tryon Street at 1:31 a.m. when a hunched lone figure is stopped by an excitable young woman. Dude is dressed all in black, scraggly beard, greasy hair, tiny frame. He’s so aggressively meek that he’s gotta be a celebrity of some sort. He looks like the rough draft they threw out when they were making Johnny Depp. Girls in iridescent cocktail dresses and freshly pressed hair have a better sense for these things than I. They flock around the little guy brandishing iPhones. He poses without smiling, then moves along, hands in pockets, the weight of fame pressing his head downward. “Who was that?” we ask, for we are tired middle-aged hacks, not swoony young Democratic party groupies on the make. “JARED GATO!!!!” cries one of the young women. “Who?” says a colleague. “Thirty Seconds to Mars?” she says. Ah, well. If you’re extremely female and 24, Jared Leto is indeed the singer of Thirty Seconds to Mars, a mediocre rock band. If you’re the same plus 20 years, he’s an actor, the one who played the dreamboat on “My So-Called Life.” On the other hand, if you have any taste, he is (along with Meat Loaf) one of Tyler Durden’s creepy postmodernist terror troops in “Fight Club.” Mr. Gato/Leto is, in other words, a rock star, a love object, a monster. He reminded us all of another celebrity shuffling dejectedly through Charlotte. Another guy whose best work was years ago, whose reinvention hasn’t really worked out, who was a heartthrob before he became just “that guy.” And though his youngest fans still want a picture, they’re a little confused about his true identity. What happened to the great conciliator who said, “There’s not a liberal America and a conservative America; there’s the United States of America,” at the DNC in 2004? This time around, Barack Obama the unifier became Barack Obama the divider. Speaker after Democratic National Convention speaker pursued a strategy of Karl Rovian “shoring up the base” — appealing to specific minority interests rather than the general interest — by emphasizing, and re-emphasizing, and re-re-emphasizing, the party’s stance as the champion of abortion (“women’s health decisions”), gay marriage (“who we love”) and illegal immigrants (“Dreamers”). As though any American seriously doubted which party was more supportive of these things. In 2004, Obama said, “We worship an awesome God in the blue states.” The Almighty’s awesomeness had been substantially downgraded by last week, when Obama approved a platform that excluded the word God. Then, under pressure, he restored it. But a flock of the faithless thrice cried “No!” when asked whether a single mention of God should be added to the party platform. They furiously booed when their voice vote was ignored. To put it mildly, booing God doesn’t look good when the world is watching, and the pundits were forced to hit pause on 30 years of asserting conventions are phony stage shows to admit that the Democrats had come up with something spontaneous, and it was spontaneous combustion. Who boos God? Who makes a fuss over one harmless word? Were they worried about offending the United Association of Satanists? Does Lucifer have a back-channel link to Valerie Jarrett? Did Beelzebub go to school with Tim Geithner? But Democrats didn’t need God in the platform. Because as of Thursday night, they had God on the platform. Obama walked on stage for what could be the second to last of his 45,617 nationally televised addresses, should he be forced to concede on Nov. 6. On this night, true to the party’s three-day mission to alienate the American middle, the crowd frequently chanted, “Four more years!” as though they didn’t read the memo that only 23% of Americans consider themselves better off than in 2008. Obama did not mention the Lord (except for the “God bless you” stuff at the end) but did quote Scripture. It turns out the part he finds intriguing is the seven words that sound most like one of his campaign slogans: “Ours is a future filled with hope.” But according to the speech, ours is a future filled with the past. Thousands of words boiled down to three: “More of same.” Obama promised more unfunded “investments” of the kind he borrowed $5 trillion to buy in his first term — in the poor, in health care, in clean energy, in education, in regulations. He issued prickly defenses of previous bailouts and handouts. Like his predecessors on the podium (“The rescue of the auto industry . . . saved more than 1 million American jobs,” said Joe Biden at a particularly ludicrous moment), Obama sought to portray himself as the Jesus with the power to raise an Escalade from the dead. “We reinvented a dying auto industry,” he claimed, by which he meant he bailed out the unions that had bankrupted two of the many companies that build cars here. Ford, to Obama, doesn’t count and the nonunion manufacturers in right-to-work states super-especially don’t count. Oh, and all auto manufacturing in the US combined employs only 700,000 people. Saving GM and Chrysler saved 1 million out of 700,000? Must be another lesson in what Obama called “Clinton arithmetic.” Which is a class taught right after the Clinton English seminar on the definition of “is.” Nor would GM have ceased to exist (Biden: “If the president didn’t act immediately, there wouldn’t be an industry left to save”). Had it gone through an ordinary bankruptcy; it simply would have restructured and shed more of the union obligations that are a hazard to its long-term health. And far from thriving, GM (“on top of the world” — Biden) is about to fall into third place and its stock has been about as attractive as Groupon’s. Taxpayers got the sticker shock of $25 billion. And for that they didn’t even send you a Malibu. I have no idea where Biden learned such misleading tactics, but by coincidence he is the son of a used-car salesman. (Or as he put it in his speech, “an auto man.”) Obama was lively. The crowd was jubilant. It’s just his ideas that were dead. Even the people who get paid to notice things have finally noticed. (“Oba-meh” — Politico. “Just didn’t have that spark” — Bob Schieffer. “Disappointed me, and I’m not quite sure why” — Joe Klein). Believe it or not, a recent study rated coverage of Obama on MSNBC to be only 54% favorable. Walking out of the convention center, Sam Donaldson compared Obama to a poker player who keeps raising but eventually gets called — on the pair of deuces he’s holding. On Wednesday, two-thirds of Democratic consultants (and 98% of GOP ones) surveyed by National Journal said Obama had not answered the charge that we’re worse off than four years ago. How could he? Real median wages last quarter were down 1.5% in the last two years — and are still lower than they were in 2002. Joblessness has been over 8% for a 43 months. So why did the crowd cheer? The answer was written on a bus parked outside the arena. It was promoting an Obama-backing PAC, and emblazoned on its side was an elaborately painted image of the president and the legend, “STOP DISRESPECTING MY PRESIDENT!” Note the possessive. One of Obama’s big applause lines Thursday was this: “I’m no longer just a candidate. Now I’m the president.” It’s impossible to imagine George Bush or Jimmy Carter inviting people to cheer his job title, but the Democrats were really cheering for themselves, for having the goodness of heart to make this man the leader of the free world. MY president. This is why so many Democratic speakers fired up the crowd by excoriating Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell’s unexceptional statement that denying the president a second term was his party’s “top political priority.” Was not defeating President Bush Democrats’ top political priority in 2004? Of course. The difference is that people didn’t feel that President Bush was them. To put the goal of defeating Obama so bluntly felt like singling out the nation’s most successful black man. It felt personal, it felt like disrespect. Obama is unlike any candidate in the way many millions of his supporters feel a personal connection to him, one that can be closely tied to race. Black Americans have many good reasons to feel they have received less than adequate respect in the history of our country, and to many of them any knock on Obama — even in the cold, hard language of budget numbers — is a knock on the entire group. Core supporters are thinking, “What did people expect? Miracles? Do they ever hold a white guy to that standard?” The Nov. 5, 2008, issue of The Onion was prophetic: “Black Man Given Nation’s Worst Job.” The story continued, “In his new high-stress, low-reward position, Obama will be charged with such tasks as completely overhauling the nation’s broken-down economy, repairing the crumbling infrastructure and generally having to please more than 300 million Americans and cater to their every whim on a daily basis.” Voters know, or think they know, that Obama means well, but they also know he has failed. Democrats know this also, hence the many variations on Bill Clinton’s implausible excuse (cue the finger wag most famously deployed in denying he had sexual relations with that young woman), “No president — not me, not any of my predecessors — no one could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years.” Clinton offered no support for this unprovable assertion, just as he didn’t explain how it is possible that Democrats should feel good both about the Clinton years, when the federal share of GDP fell from 22% to 18%, and the massive Obama spending spree that jacked that figure up to a gargantuan 24%. Few can be persuaded that more of such extravagant waste will form what Clinton called “the foundation for a new, modern, successful economy of shared prosperity.” In Romney’s tenderly brutal formulation, “You know there’s something wrong with the kind of job he’s done as president when the best feeling you had is the day you voted for him.” Even many white moderates who convene in focus groups speak in hushed tones of their personal fondness for Obama, or at least for his “story.” Catering to them is a group of the most polite and delicate attack ads in history, in which ordinary people first praise Obama before announcing their support for his challenger. Undecided voters say things like, “He’s trying,” but also things like, “Disappointing.” Obama is pitied. And that has to be even more infuriating than the racism he famously predicted would be at the heart of any case against him (“He’s got a funny name. And did I mention he’s black?” was his best guess at how the attack ads would go). The opposite has been the case: Romney treads carefully because of Obama’s race. He must not make things personal, must not indulge in name-calling of any kind, must not turn Obama into a victim. Yet in a sense Obama is the nation’s No. 1 victim, of the absurdly grandiose mythology he unabashedly encouraged. The sound of a giant hot-air balloon deflating was everywhere at the convention, if you were listening for it. Thursday afternoon Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters chose to sing “My Hero,” which he said “makes perfect sense here.” So it did, as it seemed to usher Obama out the door of the White House: “There goes my hero/Watch him as he goes/He’s ordinary.” Even more painfully, hilariously appropriate was Mary J. Blige’s bizarre choice to perform U2’s “One” — a breakup song that for 20 years has been mistaken for an anthem of unity. (The band’s guitar player The Edge once said he was gobsmacked to hear that newlyweds were playing it at their weddings.) “I’m just so glad that we’re all in this together,” Blige said, echoing a notion trumpeted dozens of times at the podium over the three days. Yet the song sounded like a cross-examination of the president on this stage. “Is it getting better?/Or do you feel the same” sounded like a Republican attack ad. Then Blige continued on with what sounded like a mockery of Obama’s speech and his failure to wield mystical powers (“Have you come here for forgiveness? Have you come to raise the dead? Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head?”) In the song you can also hear Obama’s plea that we should (somehow, impossibly) carry each other. But there’s still no doubt that “One” is about lost patience, affection reaching its expiration date. The caustic climax of “One” seemed to presage the dismal jobs report that would come out 18 hours later and reveal that four times as many Americans dropped out of work as found jobs last month. It sounded like the two-thirds of Americans who think the country is on the wrong track. It sounded like the pro-Romney ad released the very same day that likened America’s love affair with Barack Obama as a relationship that just didn’t work out. “You gave me nothing now,” Blige sang, for America. “It’s all I got . . . I can’t be holding on/To what you got/When all you got is hurt.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, is paid not to tell the truth about school choice. She deserves a raise. In a speech last week, she purported to uncover the racist roots of the school-choice movement in “massive resistance” to school desegregation in the 1960s. She noted that segregationist politicians in Prince Edward County, Va., notoriously shut down the public schools rather than integrate, and set up a private-school system that white kids could use tuition grants and tax credits to attend. “Make no mistake,” Wingarten said, by way of prefacing not just a mistake, but a historically perverse smear, “this use of privatization coupled with disinvestment are only slightly more polite cousins of segregation.” Therefore pro-school choice Education Secretary Betsy DeVos bears an ideological relation to George Wallace. QED. Weingarten must know that no one in the school-choice movement looks for inspiration to Prince Edward County, even if she doesn’t let that stop her. The intellectual seed of school choice was first planted in 1955 by Milton Friedman, the late Nobel Prize-winning libertarian economist never mistaken for a bigot. Friedman believed widely available vouchers would create new dynamism in a state-dominated sector characterized by stasis. The real-world political impetus for choice has been developing alternatives to rotten public schools for poor minority kids without other options. see also Teachers union president calls charter schools ‘polite cousin of segregation’ The first notable law came in the late 1980s in Minnesota, championed by its Democratic governor, Rudy Perpich, and passed by its impeccably progressive legislature. It permitted parents to send their kids to school districts where they didn’t live with public money. The liberal American Prospect reported at the time that supporters of the reform included “1960s-era ‘open school’ progressives.” Then came an experiment in Wisconsin to provide poor parents assistance to send their kids to private schools. Polly Williams, an African-American state assemblywoman from Milwaukee, became a high-profile advocate of choice. A Black Panther and the state chairman of Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign, Williams was open about her “pro-black” views and even said in private she didn’t much like white people. Harry Byrd, the Virginia champion of “massive resistance,” she was emphatically not. From these beginnings, choice has burgeoned into the educational mainstream. Half of states have private school-choice programs, and more than 40 have charter-school laws. They don’t aim to take white kids out of integrated schools, but to take minority kids out of underperforming de-facto segregated schools. Weingarten used to head the teachers union in New York, where her nemesis was Eva Moskowitz, the founder of the Success Academy Charter Schools. Moskowitz is a Democrat who happens to believe poor kids deserve better than what they get in the traditional public-school system. More On: school choice 6,163,001 reasons for California voters to recall Gavin Newsom on Tuesday Happy Birthday, freedom-fighter Institute for Justice Teachers unions' mask demands have gotten them into a Catch-22 dilemma Dems' disgraceful war on schools that actually teach poor, minority children According to the New York Post, her 41 schools enroll about 14,000 kids, almost all of them minorities. The demand is vast: Annual waiting lists exceed 10,000 families. The analogue for today’s choice programs aren’t the segregationist academies of Prince Edward Island but the efforts by black leaders to bypass a system long designed to deny their children a proper education. “An analysis of American history,” a recent piece in The Atlantic related, “indicates that the use of private means was a critical aspect to ensure quality education for African Americans legally excluded from access to public institutions.” Today, black kids aren’t legally excluded from the best schools but legally bound to failing ones. In her speech, Weingarten bizarrely compared defenders of the status quo — amply funded by union dues, and embedded in entrenched bureaucracies — to David and the reformers fighting for every inch to Goliath. These are the words of a woman who knows the other side has the moral high ground and the only way she can try to re-gain it is through obfuscation and tortured rationalizations. Hers, in short, is the voice of someone who is losing — and deserves to. Twitter: @RichLowry Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Donald Trump is gaining support among African-American voters — whose enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton is eroding, a tracking poll released Saturday revealed. Trump saw a 16.5 percentage-point increase in backing from African-American voters in a Los Angeles Times/University of Southern California tracking poll, up from 3.1 percent on Sept. 10 to 19.6 percent through Friday. Meanwhile, the same poll showed Clinton’s support among that group plummeting from 90.4 percent on Sept. 10 to 71.4 percent. Clinton’s nearly 20-point crash began Sunday, said Dan Schnur of USC. Sunday was the day Clinton was recorded collapsing while entering a Secret Service van at a 9/11 event. The survey, which spanned through Friday, included the days in which Trump reignited the divisive “birther” issue — which critics contend is a thinly veiled attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the country’s first black president. Late Wednesday, Trump had refused to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, demurring on the topic in a Washington Post interview published the next day. But at a bizarre press conference at Trump International, his new ­hotel in Washington, DC, on Friday, the tycoon conceded, “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.” For the week, the poll found a 6-point rise for Trump. The Republican is now at 47.2 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 41.2 percent. “It’s the largest shift we’ve seen in a one-week period since we began polling in July,” Schnur said. Share Selection",

BUSTING A GUT: Robert Schiavelli laughs off the two tickets that Rockville Centre, LI, cops issued him for disturbing the peace — by laughing. ( ) There’s no pursuit of happiness for this Long Island man — local cops busted him for laughing too loudly in his own home. Robert Schiavelli, 42, was recently slapped with two “absurd” summonses because his next-door neighbor complained that he could hear his hearty guffaws from across the driveway. “I didn’t know it was a crime to laugh out a window,” said Schiavelli, who is considered disabled because he has frequent seizures and suffers from neurological impairments. Schiavelli was chortling because he says his neighbor often taunts him due to his disability — and his best defense is to laugh him off. But a detective responded to the Rockville Centre neighbor’s complaints and wrote up two tickets for “disturbing the peace” at 6 p.m. on Feb. 12 and 13. Each summons carried a $250 fine or 15 days in jail. “It’s absurd,” lawyer Andrew Campanelli said. “My client faces 30 days in jail for laughing.” Schiavelli, who lives with his mother, was charged with acting “in such a manner as to annoy, disturb, interfere with, obstruct, or be offensive to others.” “The last time I checked, it was not a crime to laugh — except in Rockville Centre,’’ Campanelli said. At Schiavelli’s arraignment yesterday, local Judge William Croutier said he “was not so inclined” to dismiss the charges. When the judge asked why police were called, Campanelli said, “My client is a bit of a gentle giant. The way he responds [to his neighbor] is to laugh.” “I will never let him take a plea on this,” a fuming Campanelli added after court. A return date hasn’t been set. The tickets stem from a years-long feud between Schiavelli and his mother, Suzanne, and next-door neighbor Daniel O’Hanian. O’Hanian regularly taunts and ridicules Schiavelli about his disability, the mother and son allege. “He tries to intimidate Robert” by calling him “a retard’’ and other names, said Suzanne, 65. After years of the alleged treatment, Suzanne said her son “has learned to laugh at him.” The day the summonses were written, “I was making dinner. Our neighbor was in the driveway wiping off his car and sneering at Robert” while he was inside the house, Suzanne explained. As usual, Schiavelli addressed O’Hanian’s alleged glares with a good chuckle. “What else are you supposed to do when someone calls you a retard?” asked Schiavelli, who graduated from high school as a special-education student. O’Hanian’s wife, Virginia, defended the summonses, saying, “The police investigated and found there was cause. I think the police can answer all your questions. I think the police did what they thought was best.” Her husband, an engineer, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Bill de Blasio ran Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaign in 2000. Now it’s 2015 and he’s giving her a hard time. This is odd. “It’s time to see a clear, bold vision for progressive economic change,” he told “Meet The Press” host Chuck Todd a week ago on the cusp of Clinton’s declaration for the presidency, and then said he was not ready to endorse her (or anybody else) “until I see an actual vision of where they want to go.” He doubled down a couple of days later. “This is a different country we’re living in right now, and I think we need to hear a vision that relates to this time,” de Blasio declared, and went on to call Hillary “a candidate who has not been in the public eye in this sense for almost eight years, and we’re still beginning to hear what she stands for.” This is far more provocative than it sounds. In the first place, endorsements mean a great deal to politicians, more than they should and more than the public really knows. View video Pols and their people remember vividly who came aboard early and who didn’t, because the value of any endorsement wanes the later it gets and the closer the endorsee gets to winning — unless it’s unexpected or has surprising news value (i.e., Ted Kennedy picking Barack Obama over Hillary in 2008). It’s especially meaningful that a leading Democratic politician who can claim to have played a major role in getting Hillary elected in the first place — and who serves in what is now her home state — would delay an endorsement. One obvious question comes to mind: Does he know something about her from when she ran that has generated some misgivings? Leah TiscioneOf course, he could just be acting out of hurt feelings and a sense of grudge: She did not endorse his mayoral bid until a week after he had won the Democratic primary in 2013. Surely he had asked during the course of his long-shot bid, and surely he had been rebuffed. Remember: Anthony Weiner was in the race for a while and was even leading before he reminded everyone what a sick puppy he really is — and he’s married to Hillary’s closest aide. Even so, no one would have looked askance at Hillary endorsing her old political aide. Even if she had differences with him ideologically, she could have done so. Everyone understands politics depends on loyalty and that loyalty is supposed to go both ways. Except if you’re a Clinton, of course. The Clintons, as you might be aware, do not believe loyalty is a two-way street — you are required to give it to them but it’s entirely up to them whether they’re to give it back to you (provided you agree not to testify). But let’s get this out of the realm of the personal and into the realm of the ideological. The fact is that Hillary chose de Blasio to manage her campaign in 2000 precisely because she needed a bridge to the New York progressive community that had long since grown suspicious of the budget-balancing, war-with-Bosnia-fighting, school-uniforms-supporting, “era-of-big-government-is-over”-preaching Clintons. It makes sense de Blasio would find Hillary Clinton a discomfiting leader of his party… She had always been considered the left-wing conscience in an ideologically impure Clinton White House, and her senatorial campaign successfully burnished that idea. But then she became a senator, and what did she do? She found it necessary to move to the center, especially on foreign policy and terrorism issues. She voted for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. She supported the Patriot Act. She supported the Homeland Security Act. She supported increases in defense spending to enlarge the size of the US military. It is impossible to overstate how enraging all these things — even the war in Afghanistan, which was supported almost unanimously in this country in the wake of 9/11 outside the fever swamps of the Far Left and Far Right — were to this city’s progressive activists. They considered the war on terror in all its manifestations either a fraud or a gigantic act of misdirection consciously intended to empower corporations and evil Republicans. They loathed the Patriot Act and detested the Homeland Security Act. (In 2004, de Blasio co-sponsored a resolution in the City Council attacking the Patriot Act and calling for a repeal of much of it.) Hillary left the Senate in 2008 to become Barack Obama’s secretary of state, and over the course of four years she was (or so we have been told) a supporter of US military involvement in Libya and Syria. Even worse for her standing with progressives like de Blasio, Obama’s Republican-holdover secretary of defense, Robert Gates, wrote in his 2014 memoir that “I found her smart, idealistic but pragmatic, tough-minded, indefatigable, funny, a very valuable colleague, and a superb representative of the United States all over the world.” While de Blasio claims to be withholding his support from Hillary until he hears her articulate a progressive economic vision, the truth is that the suspicions of her among progressives have to do with her foreign-policy views. Those play a larger role in de Blasio’s political consciousness than he acknowledges. He called himself a “democratic socialist” 25 years ago. He remains proud of the fact that he literally went to pick coffee beans in support of the Marxist Sandinistas during the 1980s. He and his wife honeymooned in Cuba in the 1990s, and brag about it. He co-sponsored a celebration in the New York City Council chambers in honor of Robert Mugabe, the totalitarian thug who runs Zimbabwe. Given all this, it makes sense De Blasio would find Hillary Clinton a discomfiting leader of his party — and given the fact that he is probably the most left-wing person to hold a major office in the United States. Also, he gets national press attention and air time. What could be better? Plus, if he loses his re-election bid in 2017, a show on MSNBC! Despite de Blasio’s overblown rhetoric, however, he does not represent a national movement. A statistically small segment of a very liberal city elected him mayor. His allies couldn’t beat Rahm Emanuel in Chicago, and he couldn’t beat Gov. Andrew Cuomo on the issues that matter. De Blasio may indeed accomplish something miraculous. Not stocking Congress with socialists. No, he could make Hillary Clinton look more sane. Share Selection",

        "articles": "News By Joshua Rhett Miller February 25, 2021 | 10:39am A teacher’s aide in Maryland masturbated during a Zoom call with eighth-graders — but insists he thought the online lesson had ended. Marc Schack, an assistant for special education students at Shady Grove Middle School in Gaithersburg, told the Bethesda Magazine Wednesday he was unaware his self-love session had been captured on the virtual call until being interviewed. “I thought I was logged out when class was over,” Schack told the bimonthly mag. “I had no clue that Zoom was still on. Why would I do that? That’s my job. I had no clue that Zoom was on. I mean, that’s just crazy behavior.” A 13-second clip — later posted on social media – shows Schack gaze at his screen before standing up, taking a few steps away and beginning to pleasure himself, according to the report. Schack’s name appeared on the screen as the host of the Zoom call. Seconds later, another name appeared, replacing him as the moderator. The 21-year employee for Montgomery County Public Schools – who also runs Pirate Magic, a business that throws “pirate parties” for youngsters while he portrays a character named “Captain Silly Bones” – said he has since been placed on administrative leave. But he insisted his actions were “just a mistake.” “I’m only human,” he continued. “It was my bad.” District officials called Schack Monday to say he was being put on leave, adding that they had “misplaced his background check file,” he said. “Maybe they were looking to see if I had any criminal misbehavior or anything like that,” Schack told Bethesda Magazine. But district officials didn’t reference the troubling video portion to him Monday, Schack said, claiming he was unaware of the footage until Wednesday. “I’m not a pervert or anything like that, you know,” he continued. “You gotta believe me on that … I thought I was in the privacy of my own home. I had no clue.” A district spokeswoman confirmed to The Post Thursday that a staffer had been put on leave as an investigation is ongoing into “inappropriate behavior that was sexual in nature” earlier this week. “Per our procedures, we do not release the names of staff members that are under investigation,” spokeswoman Gboyinde Onijala said in a statement. “Local authorities were informed and are investigating as well.” A spokesman for Montgomery County police confirmed the probe but declined further comment Wednesday since no charges have been filed, according to the report. Messages seeking comment from Schack were not returned early Thursday.",

When sermons of Obama’s Chicago pastor, Jeremiah Wright, surfaced during the Iowa primaries, it threatened to derail Obama’s campaign. ABC aired one where Wright screamed, “Goddamn America!” Edward Klein interviewed Wright, who told him Obama’s team tried to buy his silence. ‘Man, the media ate me alive,” Wright told me when we met in his office at Chicago’s Kwame Nkrumah Academy. “After the media went ballistic on me, I received an e-mail offering me money not to preach at all until the November presidential election.” MICHELLE OBAMA’S ‘JEALOUSY’ AND ‘RESENTMENT’ LED TO RIFT WITH OPRAH “Who sent the e-mail?” I asked Wright. “It was from one of Barack’s closest friends.” “He offered you money?” “Not directly,” Wright said. “He sent the offer to one of the members of the church, who sent it to me.” “How much money did he offer you?” “One hundred and fifty thousand dollars,” Wright said. “Did Obama himself ever make an effort to see you?” “Yes,” Wright said. “Barack said he wanted to meet me in secret, in a secure place. And I said, ‘You’re used to coming to my home, you’ve been here countless times, so what’s wrong with coming to my home?’ So we met in the living room of the parsonage of Trinity United Church of Christ, at South Pleasant Avenue right off 95th Street, just Barack and me. I don’t know if he had a wire on him. His security was outside somewhere. “And one of the first things Barack said was, ‘I really wish you wouldn’t do any more public speaking until after the November election.’ He knew I had some speaking engagements lined up, and he said, ‘I wish you wouldn’t speak. It’s gonna hurt the campaign if you do that.’ “And what did you say?” I asked. “I said, ‘I don’t see it that way. And anyway, how am I supposed to support my family?’ And he said, ‘Well, I wish you wouldn’t speak in public. The press is gonna eat you alive.’ “Barack said, ‘I’m sorry you don’t see it the way I do. Do you know what your problem is?’ And I said, ‘No, what’s my problem?’ And he said, ‘You have to tell the truth.’ I said, ‘That’s a good problem to have. That’s a good problem for all preachers to have. That’s why I could never be a politician.’ “And he said, ‘It’s going to get worse if you go out there and speak. It’s really going to get worse.’ “And he was so right.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. A lieutenant colonel in the Space Force has been removed from his post — after he went on a podcast to claim that Marxism is invading the military, according to a report. Lt. Col. Matthew Lohmeier was temporarily reassigned after going on a podcast and touting his book, “Irresistible Revolution: Marxism’s Goal of Conquest & the Unmaking of the American Military,” according to military.com. “This decision was based on public comments made by Lt. Col. Lohmeier in a recent podcast,” a Space Force spokesman told the outlet. “Lt Gen. (Stephen) Whiting has initiated a command directed investigation on whether these comments constitute prohibited partisan political activity,” the statement said. Lohmeier, commander of the 11th Space Warning Squadron at Buckley Air Force Base in Colorado, got into hot water after appearing on the conservative podcast “Information Operation” last week. His book claims that a “neo-Marxist agenda” has infiltrated the military. “The diversity, inclusion and equity industry and the trainings we are receiving in the military … is rooted in critical race theory, which is rooted in Marxism,” Lohmeier told podcast host L. Todd Wood, military.com reported. He insisted that his book is not political, but rather a warning about the increased politicization of the armed forces — some of which he said he’s seen first-hand. Lohmeier also took apparent issue with Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby — who he referred to only as “a Pentagon spokesperson” — claiming that Kirby had said “there are too many white pilots” in the Air Force and Space Force. “If you want to provide that kind of messaging to your already-struggling pilot force, you can already expect to see further retention problems,” he said in the podcast. Kirby denied making the comment in a statement Friday. “This department has an open door to any qualified American who wants to serve,” he said. “Diversity throughout the force is a source of strength. We can’t afford to deprive ourselves of the talents and the voices of the full range of a nation that we defend. But Lohmeier said he’s gotten thank-yous from other active-duty service members. Lohmeier told military.com that he consulted with superiors, as well as legal and public affairs officials, about the book and was told he wasn’t required to submit it for security and pre-publication review. “My intent never has been to engage in partisan politics,” he said. “I have written a book about a particular political ideology in the hope that our defense department might return to being politically non-partisan in the future as it has honorably throughout history.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. It is now an established fact that the numerous naysayers who predicted President Trump could never deliver a vaccine this year were wrong. Thankfully, he did what they insisted couldn’t be done. But the no-can-do crowd now has a second puerile act: a miserly and grudging recognition of the miracle Trump and his team performed. Those expressing pinched gratitude for a fact they can’t deny include the man who has reason to be the most thankful of all Americans. “I think that the administration deserves some credit getting this off the ground with Operation Warp Speed,” Joe Biden said as he got his Trump vaccine shot. “Some credit?” Then who deserves the rest of the credit? Notice, too, that Biden can’t bring himself to say “President Trump.” It’s just the “administration” that deserves “some credit.” This is stingy stuff. Imagine for a second that Trump had not pushed as hard as he did and instead allowed the vaccine research, development and human trials to follow the usual drawn-out process through the maze of approval checkpoints. That would mean a delay of possibly four or five years, putting the vaccine’s debut near or after the end of Biden’s term. In the long interval, how many more Americans would have died from the coronavirus? Half a million more? A million, 2 million? Whatever the additional horrific toll, the worst clearly has been avoided and many, many lives have been saved. Think also of the economic impacts of going another four or five years without a vaccine. Repeated waves of infections would have been met with more lockdowns and restrictions, slashing or eliminating income to tens of millions of families and driving cities and states closer to bankruptcy. Even Washington’s money-printing presses would have had trouble keeping up. There’s little doubt how Biden himself would have reacted absent a vaccine. He said during the campaign he would “follow the science” and if that meant national lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, so be it. One of his top advisers suggested a lockdown across the country lasting “four to six weeks” would control the pandemic and allow the economy to reopen. Right, except remember that the initial lockdowns were going to be for just two weeks and that would be enough to flatten the curve. That was nine months ago. In fact, the Trump vaccine is a great gift to the nation and the world, and that includes the Biden administration. Its agenda on issues like climate and tax hikes would have been dead on arrival without a way to reopen the country and give people hope that better and safer days are coming. The vaccine also will allow Biden to pursue something like a normal presidency in that he will no longer be forced to shun most human contact because of his age and health problems. He campaigned primarily from his Delaware basement, but it is inconceivable he could have governed while being isolated in the Oval Office and locked down in the White House. The vaccine will free him personally, so it shouldn’t be asking too much for Biden to acknowledge Trump’s contribution in a complete and honest way. But apparently it is asking too much. Nonetheless, getting the vaccine successfully produced and with millions of doses now being distributed and administered, Operation Warp Speed must be counted as Trump’s greatest achievement as president. It is hard to believe any other modern commander in chief would have done it nearly as well, let alone ­better. This was a triumph of the first ­order made possible by the sheer force of his personality. Trump’s relentless pressure on private companies as well as the sprawling bureaucracy turned what many in the left-wing media and even some in the medical community regarded as a pipe dream into a lifesaving reality. It’s as if his take-no-prisoners determination was made for the moment, an impression that adds to the irony given that the pandemic wrecked the final year of his presidency and probably cost him four more years. In the run-up to the election, most voters gave the president a thumbs-down on his handling of the coronavirus, with an early ­October Pew poll giving Biden a 17-point advantage on the topic, despite the fact that the Democrat had not proposed anything significantly different from what Trump was doing. Recall, too, that prior to the outbreak, Trump looked to be headed to almost certain victory largely on the strength of the roaring economy. Unemployment rates for blacks and Latinos hit historic lows, and wages were rising faster for workers at the bottom and middle than at the top. The median family income in 2019 was the highest ever recorded at $68,703, an increase of 6.8 percent in just one year, according to Census Bureau statistics. That amount was more than $6,000 higher than median household income in 2016, the last year of the Obama-Biden administration. But the fear and the political fear-mongering, combined with an economic freeze that cost upwards of 40 million people their jobs at some point, vaporized the president’s ­major strength. His pledge to rebuild what had been destroyed failed to counter the argument made by Biden and the media that Trump had failed initially to grasp the seriousness of the outbreak and lacked heartfelt sympathy for grieving families. So despite the fact that the vaccine came soon enough to save an enormous number of lives, it came too late to save Trump’s job. Still, it was a remarkable achievement for which all Americans should be grateful. It’s his slogan! Headline: Robinhood Accused of Misleading Investors. Guess the investors didn’t read the book. Robin Hood and his Merry Men steal from the rich. That’s their job! A cure for dead voters Reader Frank Giabia has an idea about how to combat one form of voter fraud–dead people voting. He writes: “When my Dad passed, I contacted Social Security to advise them. They told me they already knew. Apparently they were advised by funeral parlor or got the death certificate. “Why can’t the same system be used to notify election boards?” Biden’s signals to ‘independent’ AG Joe Biden has said repeatedly, including at Tuesday’s press conference, that he will not discuss the FBI’s criminal tax probe into his son Hunter Biden with the person he nominates for Attorney General. He doesn’t have to. By suggesting publicly, as he also did again Tuesday, that some of the media coverage about his son’s conduct is “Russian disinformation,” Biden is giving an unmistakable signal that Hunter Biden is a victim, not a perpetrator. Any possible AG nominee who misses the signal won’t get the job. Case closed. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The case for an Obama third term, a.k.a. a Hillary Clinton presidency, just suffered a major blow. Indeed, Friday’s jobs report (or lack-of-jobs report) is just the thing Clinton feared most when she launched her presidential bid: namely, that Obamanomics, which boils down to the bizarre notion that higher taxes, more regulation and class warfare actually work, would begin to fully implode while she was forced into defending it on the campaign trail — or risk losing the president’s endorsement. The sickeningly weak job creation during the month of May (just 38,000 jobs when economists expected closer to 150,000) doesn’t mean the economy is “officially” heading to a recession. But it’s yet another sign we could be heading in that direction. Sure, the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent. But that’s only because more people stopped looking for work: The labor-force participation rate fell to a level right out of the malaise of the 1970s. The May slowdown in job creation (the slowest since September 2010), meanwhile, is coupled with tepid wage growth and comes on the heels of a barely growing economy for the first quarter of 2016. (GDP of .8 percent which, I guess, is better than nothing, but not by much.) Even worse: April’s weak job growth of 160,000 was revised down to just 123,000. Yes, there was a Verizon strike, but during past “recoveries” (as President Obama likes to call the economy under his watch), such intangibles didn’t present themselves as near-existential economic threats. They were merely blips on an overall radar screen of green. The political implications of all of this, to use a quote from Clinton’s GOP challenger, Donald Trump, are yuuuge. The former first lady and Obama secretary of state has always had a love-hate relationship with President Obama’s hand-me-down economy. Out of fear of alienating voters who might turn to her lefty challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, she has to pay lip service to the real economic hardships Americans are feeling thanks to the business environment created by her old boss. And yet she needs her old boss for that all-important endorsement. So as bad as things are, she must make the case they would’ve been worse without Obamanomics. Trump should easily exploit this. To do so, he’ll have to take the occasional break from focusing his fire on Hillary’s “crooked” past. He’s not wrong, of course, about Clintonian sleaze. But charges of corruption never seem to stick to the Clintons, because most Americans seem to accept their amoral behavior as the price of their competency. The problem facing Hillary as the Obama economy goes south is that she’s looking less and less competent trying to attack and simultaneously defend it. In the end, the price of an Obama endorsement will be voters associating her with his absurd economic theories that produced what the numbers showed us on Friday: an economy and job market that are barely growing and, most worrisome to Hillary, a possible recession. Of course, things could improve; the latest GDP report and Friday’s poor job-growth numbers can always be revised upward. The Verizon strike may indeed have been the catalyst for the lousy jobs report, and businesses may be about to hire like there’s no tomorrow. And Trump could say something really stupid that would alienate even more possible supporters. But the economic numbers could also get worse — a notion that’s no longer whispered even among super-cautious Wall Street analysts who don’t want to do anything to spook skittish investors. Case in point: Barclays bank on Friday said that risks of a near- to medium-term recession have risen enough to put out a warning note on the subject. Given her vast network of supporters on Wall Street (and the source of much of her lucrative speaking fees and wealth), Clinton knows those risks as well as anyone, I am told. And that means she knows they are the biggest risk to her chances of becoming president. Charles Gasparino is a Fox Business senior correspondent. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Occupy Wall Street is easily the greatest, most successful political movement in American history — a national phenomenon involving white, affluent college students from all walks of life. Yes, lately it has been a lot easier to ignore. Much like a bear, it went into hibernation for the winter. But also like a bear, it’s going to wake up come spring and start mauling its enemies. And stealing picnic baskets. What’s made OWS so successful? That’s easy to see when you look at less successful movements — like the civil-rights movement, which was huge in the 1960s but then lost momentum. Why did it falter? Because it had goals and met them. Nothing ruins a political movement like achieving its goals. No one wants to keep yelling and waving signs after they get what they want. OWS wisely avoided this pitfall. The Occupiers roared in with nonspecific anger — about such things as Wall Street, with its walls and its streets, and the rich, with their money they got somehow — but it never set any actual goals. The Occupiers just came and set up camps near banks with absolutely no exit strategy. And then they started yelling, “We won’t leave until . . .” and sort of mumbled after that. This brilliance is why OWS will be around forever, unlike lesser movements. Actually, OWS does have one specific concern to address. In cities from New York to Oakland and even Washington, DC, officials have told the Occupiers that they can’t camp in public areas. But this gives OWS an issue that complements a never-ending political movement: camping rights. Many in OWS weren’t even aware of this problem when they started their protests, but that’s what a good movement does — it organically finds problems no one even knew existed. If you think about it, campers are one of the most oppressed groups out there, often forced to set up tents in the middle of nowhere where no one can see them. But no more. OWS isn’t ashamed of camping and thus wants to camp out in public, to be seen by all, and in walking distance of a Starbucks. And with WiFi access. So OWS has temporarily given up all those nonspecific concerns about greed to focus on the important right to camp in public. Because as long as the Occupiers can camp, they can keep this movement going forever. I expect all this to have a huge effect on the November election. After all, whiny white college kids are a giant political force. No, they may not have a lot of money to donate — they’ve spent most of that upgrading their Apple products — but they have huge enthusiasm for vague change. The same vague change Barack Obama promised in his 2008 campaign yet failed to deliver, instead bringing specific change that was wildly unpopular. So, under OWS influence, expect the national debate to move from such misguided, concrete concerns as jobs and the national debt to the more important and ephemeral concerns of greed, fairness and rich people being too rich. Don’t be surprised if one of the presidential debates is replaced with a drum circle. No candidate will dare come out strongly against camping. The Occupiers will continue to camp out to fight for their right to camp out. They will go to any lengths to defend camping rights. (Except they won’t wander too far from their tents, because if you leave those unattended, people will steal from them.) It’s an important, serious cause, and perhaps when economic conditions force us to live in shanty towns, we’ll look to them as the new Founding Fathers. By then, I hope, they’ll have figured out how to deal with the rats. Political satirist Fr ank J.

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. It is an article of faith for many Americans that the Donald Trump years were an aberration and that Joe Biden will usher in something close to normalcy. I’ll take the other side of that bet. I believe the coming years are going to be at least as tumultuous as the Trump presidency. Although Biden will not directly cause that tumult, his weakness as a leader, of his own party and the nation, will help fuel discord and make it impossible for him to forge anything resembling normalcy. Most of those who think Biden can wave a magic wand blame Trump alone for the deep polarization gripping America. They’re wrong — Trump was elected precisely because the country already was deeply polarized. Moreover, while Trump’s personality is highly unorthodox, to say the least, he did not single-handedly set in motion the dangerous levels of strife engulfing our nation. His successful policies on immigration, taxes and the Mideast were fairly conventional by Republican standards. Instead, the unrest and growing use of violence to achieve political ends are outgrowths of the extreme resistance movement against Trump. He ran as a disrupter, but was a piker compared to those who hated him and were willing to smash every social, political and legal norm to drive him from office. That resistance was started by Hillary Clinton and holdouts from the 2016 election and spread to Democrats in Congress, especially Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Their refusal to treat Trump as a legitimate president and worthy of their cooperation marks them as early victims of Trump Derangement Syndrome. They incited and fanned the flames of the Russia collusion scam and used it, with the help of J. Edgar Comey and other crooked players in the FBI and intelligence agencies, to sabotage the president. The bid to overturn the 2016 election was the first pandemic to strike America, and the contagion sickened mayors and governors in blue states, the mainstream media, Hollywood, academia, the courts and much of the sports and entertainment world. The anything-goes madness made it acceptable in many quarters to declare that the president deserved to be assassinated. The final industry to put its full force against him, the social-media giants, used their monopolies not just to restrict but ultimately to silence the president of the United States. It’s as if Facebook, Twitter, Google and Apple stamped the word “cancel” on the White House. The tech blackout, while largely a response to the Capitol invasion, was the capstone of four years in which unwritten codes of conduct were broken and traditions shattered. The players were different, but the central explanation was always the same: Trump is dangerous, this time is different, we have no choice. Trump certainly made his share of mistakes, especially during the post-election period, but the most provocative thing he did was refuse to surrender. For four years, each time he punched back, the would-be destroyers escalated their attacks, which were amplified by a media chorus. The New York Times, Washington Post, broadcast networks and CNN and MSNBC were on a mission to destroy him. The claim that Trump’s conduct demanded an extraordinary effort against him is a convenient excuse. The truth is that elite institutions, businesses, unions and others aligned with Democrats made the choice that getting rid of Trump was more important than anything else. Trump didn’t break those institutions and cause half the country to distrust them. The people running them did that. There is lots of talk these days about the “big lie,” but perhaps the biggest is that America would return to normal when Trump was out of the way. He will be gone Wednesday at noon, but normalcy is nowhere to be seen. Look at Washington, turned into a garrison town of fences, barbed wire and armed soldiers patrolling the streets. Is this a normal inauguration? The visible response to the storming of Congress mirrors the rhetoric coming from Pelosi, who rushed a meaningless impeachment of Trump in just one day. Before Pelosi, in the entire history of the United States, presidential impeachment was used only twice. She doubled that total in the last 13 months. Trump is her white whale. If the departure of Trump could cure what ails America, we should be seeing signs of it already. But the victory has only stoked the anger of those who never accepted him as president. Revenge is in the air, as members of Congress and far-left activists demand that airlines, hotels, publishing houses and other businesses shun Trump supporters. Some firms are complying in a craven bid to curry favor that smacks of banana republics where the vanquished are hounded and punished for daring to dissent. In a move straight out of George Orwell, Dems and the media have twisted the plain meaning of words. “Violence” is speech when committed by Black Lives Matter, and “speech” is violence when it comes from Trumpers. Political opposition from Republican members of Congress is deemed “sedition” and 74 million Trump voters are blithely smeared as white supremacists. One so-called journalist at ABC News said America needs a “cleansing” of the Trump influence. The Times bemoaned the “mindset” of those who still support the president while others talk of “deprogramming” them. Comparisons of Trump to Hitler, Nazis and even 9/11 terrorists are so routine they no longer shock. Unfortunately, this radical talk is accompanied by equally radical plans. The Dems aim to use the coronavirus and the riot as Trojan horses to expand government power and shrink individual freedoms in a push toward socialism. Election safeguards are being permanently dismantled. To underscore the sweeping nature of what is coming, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a member of “The Squad,” tweeted Thursday that “There will be no reset button. No return to normal. The status quo was unjust in the first place.” Will Biden stop the madness? Can he? Our hopes for America hang by a very slender thread. In The New Yorker, Eric Lach reports that, according to the city’s Campaign Finance Board, “more than 35 people have filed paperwork to run” for mayor. Lach cites various explanations for why the field is so large, but I think the answer is obvious. Lots of people see what a lousy job Mayor de Blasio has done and conclude they could do better. Most of them are right! Reader Ronald Meltzer, in the midst of the wave of censoring and demonizing, sees a hidden message, writing: “I would submit to you that the fact that it is now illegal to discuss election fraud is proof there was election fraud.” Make up my mind.

So it is possible for Biden to sit in his basement and not campaign and be elected President,” Grassley said. The WSJ editorial echoed several high profile conservative voices in recent days and warned that Trump was heading for one-term ignominy. “He still has no second term message beyond his own grievances,” the Journal wrote, saying the November election was heading toward a “historic repudiation” that would drive him out of office and take the Senate GOP majority with him. Though Trump has built a formidable fundraising and campaign machine, his approval ratings remain stubbornly underwater, in a range reminiscent of past one-termers like George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter. His once-promising re-election chances have also darkened with the COVID-19 pandemic, economic upheavals and racial unrest. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard’s gold medal-winning performance at the Pacific Games continues to reverberate long after the event, with a New Zealand women’s group demanding sports authorities put a stop to “unfair” competition. Hubbard, who competed for New Zealand in men’s weightlifting before her transition in her thirties, won two golds and a silver in three of the women’s heavyweight categories at the Games in Samoa earlier this month. She topped the podium ahead of Samoan runner up and Commonwealth Games champion Feagaiga Stowers in both categories, triggering outrage in the Pacific island nation. With Hubbard free to compete at next year’s Tokyo Olympics, the 41-year-old has become a lightning rod for criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)’s guidelines for the inclusion of transgender athletes. On Monday, New Zealand based lobby group “Speak Up For Women”, which advocates that sport must be categorized by sex rather than gender identity, called on the country’s Olympic committee and sports minister to “defend women’s sport”. “Kiwis (New Zealanders) know that males competing in women’s sport is blatantly unfair,” the group’s spokesperson Ani O’Brien said. The call follows criticism from British advocates “Fair Play for Women”, who wrote on Twitter that sports officials needed to “wake up” in the days after Hubbard’s Pacific Games titles. IOC guidelines issued in 2015 said any transgender athlete could compete as a woman provided their testosterone levels are below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months prior to their first competition. That has been criticized by some scientists, who say it does little to mitigate natural biological advantages enjoyed by male-born athletes, including bone and muscle density. Researchers at the Dunedin-based University of Otago said in a peer-reviewed study published earlier this month that the IOC guidelines were “poorly drawn” and the mandated testosterone level was still “significantly higher” than that of women. The study advocated that the IOC ditch its “binary” approach to competition and consider introducing a transgender category or find another solution that balances the desire for inclusion with the need for a level playing field. The research was dismissed by transgender advocates and athletes. “The opinions of scientists although valid, are just that, opinions,” said New Zealand mountain biker Kate Weatherly, who transitioned as a teenager and has become a national champion competing against women. “I’m not winning by crazy margins and the anecdotal evidence does point to me having little to no advantage.” Hubbard has shunned the media since competing at last year’s Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast, where she was favorite to win heavyweight gold but injured herself during a lift in the competition. Her golds at the Pacific Games have renewed her profile and her status as a contender at international events. They have also re-ignited a debate set to rage all the way to Tokyo in 2020. “I really don’t think he — she — should ever participate in this (tournament), but I realize we have to (be) inclusive and we cannot exclude these people,” Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi told Reuters of Hubbard’s participation at the Pacific Games. “They ought to participate in these Games in their own category.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The president of ultra-liberal Oberlin College is standing by the professor who has been posting a slew of anti-Semitic rants and bizarre 9/11 conspiracy theories on social media. The prestigious Ohio college — alma mater of Lena Dunham — released a letter from president Marvin Krislov defending associate professor Joy Karega’s freedom of speech, The Chronicle-Telegram reported Wednesday. “I believe, as the American Association of University Professors says, that academic freedom is ‘the indispensable quality of institutions of higher education’ because it encourages free inquiry, promotes the expansion of knowledge, and creates an environment in which learning and research can flourish,” Krislov writes. “Cultivating academic freedom can be difficult and at times painful for any college community. The principles of academic freedom and freedom of speech are not just principles to which we turn to face these challenges, but also the very practices that ensure we can develop meaningful responses to prejudice,” he added. The college — which charges $49,928 for tuition — last week released a brief statement saying that Karega’s views do not represent those of the college, located outside of Cleveland. Krislov said he’s since received many messages about Karega, an associate professor who teaches rhetoric and composition, that “range from demands for [her] immediate dismissal to demands that her right to free expression be defended at all costs.” “I am a practicing Jew, grandson of an Orthodox rabbi. Members of our family were murdered in the Holocaust,” he wrote in the letter. “As someone who has studied history, I cannot comprehend how any person could or would question its existence, its horrors and the evil which caused it.” Karega, who has worked at Oberlin only since last year, wrote on numerous Facebook posts that she believes Israel was the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks around the world including 9/11 and the Charlie Hebdo slaughter in Paris. Last January, she posted a graphic of an ISIS militant pulling off a mask of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s face with the text, “France wants to Free Palestine? Time for a false flag…” “This ain’t even hard. They unleashed Mossad on France and it’s clear why,” Karega wrote in a now-private post, referencing Israel’s intelligence agency. In another post, she claimed that ISIS was created by the CIA and Mossad so that “Israeli and Zionist Jews” could carry out the 9/11 terror attacks. Karega has locked down most of her social media, but she shared a public post last week promoting an event scheduled for Wednesday night that features Robin Kelley, a history professor from the University of California at Los Angeles. “Trust, when I come up out of my Unbothered state of being, I’ll have a lot to say (analysis, no doubt) about the kinds of intimidation and silencing tactics that are rhetorically enacted in digital spaces […] and how common it is for Black women, who are early in their career on the tenure track as part of the professoriate, to be prime targets for these kinds of activities and practices,” she wrote last Friday. Last year, Karega was included in a rundown of professors who deserved tenure as part of a laundry list of demands by the Black Student Union following a period of racial tension on campus. Oberlin students made headlines recently after complaining the school’s cafeterias served “culturally inappropriate” and “inauthentic” dishes — such as improperly prepared General Tso’s chicken.

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Disgraced Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who abandoned his post in Afghanistan and was held prisoner by the Taliban for five years, is expected to plead guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Bergdahl’s decision to admit his guilt rather than face trial marks another twist in a bizarre eight-year drama that caused the nation to wrestle with difficult questions of loyalty, negotiating with hostage takers and America’s commitment not to leave its troops behind. President Trump has called Bergdahl a “no-good traitor” who “should have been executed.” It’s unclear whether the Idaho native, 31, will be locked up or receive a lesser sentence that reflects the time the Taliban held him under brutal conditions. He has said he was caged, kept in the dark, beaten and chained to a bed. Bergdahl could face up to five years on the desertion charge and a life sentence for misbehavior. Freed three years ago, Bergdahl had been scheduled for trial in late October. He chose to let a judge rather than a military jury decide his fate, but a guilty plea later this month will spare the need for a trial. Sentencing will start on Oct. 23, individuals with knowledge of the case told the Associated Press. During sentencing, US troops who were seriously wounded searching for Bergdahl in Afghanistan are expected to testify, the sources said. It was unclear whether prosecutors and Bergdahl’s defense team had reached any agreement ahead of sentencing about how severe a penalty prosecutors will recommend. Bergdahl’s lawyer, Eugene Fidell, declined to comment on Friday. Maj. Justin Oshana, who is prosecuting the case, referred questions to the Army, which declined to discuss whether Bergdahl had agreed to plead guilty. “We continue to maintain careful respect for the military-judicial process, the rights of the accused and ensuring the case’s fairness and impartiality during this ongoing legal case,” said Paul Boyce, an Army spokesman. Bergdahl was a 23-year-old private first class in June 2009 when, after five months in Afghanistan, he disappeared from his remote infantry post near the Pakistan border, triggering a massive search operation. Videos soon emerged showing Bergdahl in captivity by the Taliban, and the US kept tabs on him with drones, spies and satellites as behind-the-scenes negotiations played out in fits and starts. In May 2014, he was handed over to US special forces in a swap for five Taliban detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison, fueling an emotional debate about whether Bergdahl was a hero or a deserter. As critics questioned whether the trade was worth it, President Obama stood with Bergdahl’s parents in the White House Rose Garden and defended the swap. The US does not “leave our men or women in uniform behind,” Obama said, regardless of how Bergdahl came to be captured. Trump, as a presidential candidate, was unforgiving of Bergdahl, who has been assigned to desk duty at a Texas Army base pending the outcome of his case. At campaign events, Trump declared that Bergdahl “would have been shot” in another era, even pantomiming the pulling of the trigger. “We’re tired of Sgt. Bergdahl, who’s a traitor, a no-good traitor, who should have been executed,” Trump said at a Las Vegas rally in 2015. With AP Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. American politics may have no bigger fraud than Elizabeth “Fauxcahontas” Warren. So I got a good chuckle from Politico’s Thursday story saying the Massachusetts Democratic senator had called Donald Trump, among other grade-school taunts, a fraud. I don’t know whether Warren fancies herself the pot or the kettle in this one, but she’s definitely a hypocrite. In fact, while she was preparing to call Trump a fraud, her advisers were leaking to every major press outlet they could find that she was finally going to endorse Hillary Clinton for president, now that she has secured the necessary delegates. What a profile in courage. Endorsing Hillary could be the most fraudulent act of Warren’s brief political career, since Warren is a less compelling version of Bernie Sanders on economics and even once boasted she essentially “created” Occupy Wall Street. But there’s stiff competition. Start with that Fauxcahontas moniker. She earned it during her 2012 Senate campaign against Scott Brown after it came to light she’d claimed to be 1/32 Cherokee decades ago when seeking a Harvard Law faculty position. She wasn’t able to back up the claim. “These are my family stories,” she said. As a wealthy white woman, her gaming of the affirmative-action system also made a mockery of race-based hiring and the left’s supposed commitment to “diversity.” And wait — how did she become wealthy, anyway? Well, partly through flipping houses. Like the one owned by Mary Frances Hickman back in Warren’s native Oklahoma. In 1993, Warren convinced the elderly widow to sell her the home for a paltry $30,000, National Review reported. Five months later, Warren resold it for $145,000. It was one of at least five such lucrative flips Warren pulled off before the housing market and economy crashed in 2008 and she became a crusader for the economic rights of the “little guy.” Like elderly widows preyed upon by opportunistic profit-seekers, perhaps? But the real raison d’être of Warren’s political career is to stick it to Wall Street. Last year, Bloomberg Businessweek credited her fiery anti-bank rhetoric and senatorial procedural tricks with sabotaging attempts to roll back heavy-handed financial regulation and with making income inequality an annual rallying cry for Democrats. Warren has special ire for Goldman Sachs. After CEO Lloyd Blankfein criticized Bernie Sanders’ class-warfare rhetoric, Warren lit into him. Blankfein, she said, “thinks it’s fine to prosecute small business owners, it’s fine to go hard after individuals who have no real resources, but don’t criticize companies like Goldman Sachs and their very, very important CEO.” And then she tossed in one of her regular demagogic tricks: keeping the public angry at the banks for the 2008 financial crash. “When Blankfein says that criticizing those who break the rules is dangerous to the economy, then he’s just repeating another variation of ‘too big to fail, too big to jail, too big even to prosecute.’ That tells you here we are, seven years after the crisis and these guys still don’t get it.” Sounds like she was ready to endorse Sanders, right? Wrong. She held back until the primary contest was basically over — and then offered her backing to Hillary. What’s so ironic about this is that if Goldman Sachs, as an institution, were to somehow take human form and run for political office, it would be — hell, it is — Hillary Clinton. It’s not just the donations from the firm to her campaign, which total about $180,000 so far this cycle. It’s also that the firm has paid her four times that amount in speaking fees since she left the Senate. To say what? Well, we don’t know. Clinton won’t release the transcripts. But we have a pretty good idea. In one speech, an attendee told Politico’s Ben White, “She sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director.” Warren can back whomever she pleases. But let’s not pretend Hillary Clinton is anything other than the manifestation of everything Warren claims to be fighting against. Warren’s a fraud, always has been. What’s amazing is that her “progressive” fans still fall for it. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Are President Obama, Hillary Clinton and violent leftists in cahoots to elect Donald Trump? Or are they just idiots? The evidence is overwhelming that they all belong to a conspiracy — either of secret GOP sympathizers or of dunces. Those are the only options after Democrats took turns denouncing Trump in ways that actually bolstered the potency of his arguments. Three examples tell the tale. First, Obama traveled to Indiana to deliver what aides called his first attempt to influence the election. That’s a lie, of course, but not the biggest one of the day. No. 1 would be Obama’s touting the economy as a roaring success. “If what you care about in this election is your pocketbook; if what you’re concerned about is who will look out for the interests of working people and grow the middle class,” the president claimed, “if what you’re concerned about is the economy, then the debate is not even close.” He crowed about “progress” made during his tenure, and said sticking with Democrats was the only sensible option. Two days later, the Labor Department reported that employers added a mere 38,000 jobs in May, the worst report in six years. Even with massive help from the Federal Reserve, the economy’s slow growth means it has created three million fewer jobs than it should have by now, making Obama’s boast look ridiculous. It also makes Trump’s focus on creating jobs and criticism of ­international trade deals look like the right ideas. After all, if puny growth for seven years is the best Obama can do, why not give the other team and other ideas a chance? Clinton provided the second backfire example with her ­foreign-policy speech. It had very little to do with actual foreign policy, and everything to do with a rehearsed rant on Trump. She called him reckless, childish, uninformed and unprepared. “This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes,” she declared. The liberal press ate it up, displaying a remarkable talent for ignoring the foreign-policy ­disasters unfolding around the world, courtesy of Clinton and Obama. The next president will inherit the brutal aggressions of China and Russia and the cancerous spread of Islamic terrorism. And it takes a special media willfulness to refuse to see the biblical deprivations befalling millions of refugees spilling out from Syria and Libya after Obama and Clinton helped turn those countries’ crises into ­catastrophes. In a recent span of just eight days, about 1,000 people drowned trying to escape across the Mediterranean to ­Europe. If that’s the best Dems can do, why should they get a third term? Would Trump be worse? The third evidence of a conspiracy involved a Trump rally in San Jose, Calif. Or rather, it ­involved the thugs, gang members and people burning the American flag and waving Mexican flags who attacked Trump supporters. An ABC reporter tweeted that police lost control and that “Trump supporters [were] being terrorized and beaten up by mobs of protesters.” Among those beaten was a man named Juan Hernandez, a gay Latino Trump supporter who released photos of his broken nose and bloody shirt, along with a statement, writing: “Got jumped last night as we exited the rally . . . Thanks for a broken nose, uncontrollable bleeding, and a bash to the head, Democrats. You sure are doing your party proud.” As Hernandez notes, the violence helps make Trump’s case. If the candidate’s promise to control the border brings such a ferocious backlash, he’s on to something. That scary thought must have seeped into the central brain of The New York Times, which gave a disgracefully distorted picture of what happened in San Jose. It called the one-way ­assaults “clashes” between “protesters” and Trump backers, as if both sides were equally to blame. Even more shameful, the paper’s Friday article included this sentence: “While Mr. Trump has said he does not condone violence of any kind, his campaign made little effort to condemn it.” You can’t be that ignorant without intent. The pattern is obvious — the Democrats’ Way is in trouble. The economy won’t cooperate with their big-government nostrums, Clinton is dodging Bernie Sanders and the FBI, and Obama doesn’t understand why the world doesn’t treat his every ­utterance as gospel. Maybe they should take a hint. Maybe, finally, America has had enough. How violent are New York City schools? Good question, but there’s no good answer. A mishmash of conflicting data were revealed when parents, supported by charter groups, sued the city, saying there is so much crime that students are denied their right to a sound education. They point to state statistics gathered by schools that show a 23 percent increase in violent incidents last year. But the city uses a different measurement compiled by the NYPD. It showed violent incidents declined slightly in the same period. This is nuts. You can’t solve a problem if you can’t measure it. Then again, maybe that’s the point. It’s easier for educrats to hide behind confusion rather than make schools safer. No news there, only tragedy as usual. Tolstoy’s opening line in “Anna Karenina,” that “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,” also applies to political feuds. Witness the unhappy battle between New York’s top Democrats. With federal prosecutors probing both Gov. Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio, the officials’ sniping at each other amounts to a shootout in a lifeboat. Even the survivor might not last long. For his part, de Blasio is fixated on the least of his legal problems — a state Board of Elections report that accused him of “willful and flagrant violations” of campaign-finance laws. Repeatedly accusing Cuomo of orchestrating the report and leaking it to the press, he said it employed a double standard by ignoring Cuomo’s fund-raising. Even when the leaker was identified as a Republican operative, de Blasio refused Cuomo’s demand for an apology, saying it’s “not going to happen.” The governor, never one to turn the other cheek, had aides bombard de Blasio with mocking Twitter attacks. “I’m sure saying ‘I was wrong’ is one of the hardest things to do in politics, but continuing this charade at this point is just silly,” a Cuomo spokesman wrote. Later, he added that “Deflect is a lesser known river in Egypt as well.” So far, there is no indication the twin federal investigations are linked, and de Blasio certainly looks to be in more personal hot water. Still, the feds could use the feud to their advantage: Put both men under oath and get them to tell all they know about each other. That would be special. Reacting to my column that Donald Trump and President Obama are “two sides of the same coin,” reader Charles Parham begs to differ, writing: “Trump loves the country, Obama loathes it.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The Census Bureau paid comedian Dick Gregory between $15,000 and $20,000, plus expenses, to address workers at its headquarters in February — and now Census regrets it. The performer and civil rights activist, who is known to use raw language and racial terms that many find objectionable, spoke during Black History Month. But apparently he offended enough of the workers that Census is revising its policy on outside speakers. The Gregory situation, which I just found out about last week, is a good example of why there needs to be more oversight over how taxpayer money is spent. First, let’s listen to Census grovel. “We understand [Gregory’s] comments offended some members of the audience,” Census said in a statement to me that appears to have been sent to irate workers. “Gregory’s statement and opinions were his own and do not reflect the Census Bureau’s commitment to an inclusive workplace environment free from discrimination and harassment.” Yeah, yeah, sure. Gregory’s spiel is well known. This wasn’t Jerry Seinfeld they were hiring. “We make every effort to ensure that our external speakers represent diverse viewpoints while also respecting the audience,” it continued. Sure, diverse viewpoints! “We will seek to continue to meet this standard in the future and are thoroughly reviewing our procedures for selecting speakers to ensure their views are appropriate for a federal workplace,” the statement said. How about this? Don’t have speakers! Don’t spend money unnecessarily! Let your workers go to a comedy club for their entertainment like the rest of us do. Census didn’t get back to me when I asked how much Gregory was paid. But I learned the range of his fee from Celebrity Talent Promotions, which handles his bookings. Hopefully, Census got a discount. There is no YouTube video of Gregory’s speech that I could find. But included in Gregory’s nuggets of wisdom was apparently criticism of the “crackers” in Census management for not showing up for the talk. In case you are wondering, “crackers” have nothing to do with Nabisco. Share Selection",

PSYCHO RABBLE: NYPD officials say unruly Occupy Wall Street protesters have made a crime magnet out of Zuccotti Park. “Occupy Wall Street is no longer a protest,” said one. (Andrew Kelly) ( ) The cheap walkie-talkie crackles inside a crowded downtown McDonald’s, stopping the gathered mass mid-sip from their Kombucha bottles and cups of corporate coffee. “There’s a situation,” a vagabond gumshoe dubbed “Conscience” tells me after the static-filled communique arrives over the air at around 3 a.m. Cornered on the other side of the fast-food joint is Fisika Bezabeh, 27, a Zuccotti squatter who inexplicably returned to the eatery after allegedly clobbering a manager with a credit-card reader earlier in the night. “We can’t take him in by ourselves,” yells another OWS security-force member. COPS NETTING COURT JESTERS B’KLYN TEACHER AMONG DEMONSTRATORS WHO CLASHED WITH COPS OUTSIDE MANHATTAN SUPREME COURT The Zuccotti “cops” had just spent an hour and a half tracking Bezabeh through goat paths in the park armed with a description from the manager. “We cannot take him in by ourselves, the cops have to come!” reiterates the OWS security force member. They call the NYPD — and it becomes abundantly clear that the cops down there are sick of the antics. “Every single night it’s the same thing. I mean, some guy was a victim of rape!” an officer snarls. “There comes a time when it’s over. This is a disaster. It’s all we’re doing, every two seconds, is locking somebody up every time. It’s done. “It’s done,” he repeats. “Occupy Wall Street is no longer a protest.” Scenes like this — and far worse — have been playing out since the Zuccotti Park “occupation” began on Sept. 17. The parcel is now a sliver of madness, rife with sex attacks, robberies and vigilante justice. It’s a leaderless bazaar that’s been divided into state-like camps — with tents packed together so densely that the only way to add more would be to stack them. And despite an NYPD watchtower overhead and the entire north side of Zuccotti lined with police vehicles, it is quickly becoming one of the most dangerous places in New York City. I arrive in the Financial District after dark on Thursday lugging a backpack, a sleeping bag and layers upon layers of clothes. It’s 8 p.m., and the suits and ties fill the bars. They glare at my overstuffed bag as I walk from the E train to a 7-Eleven for a few last-minute items for my night in Zuccotti Park. The anti-bacterial soap and powder are nearly out. Naturally, the condoms are fully stocked. Outside, an old-man Occupier in a plaid earflap hat is screaming at people in the crosswalk at Church and Barclay. “Why are you afraid of bunny rabbits? Whyyyyy?” As I cautiously walk the Zuccotti perimeter, picking up photocopied literature on anarchy, there is a poster on a tent bearing a set of park rules that includes: “If you want to hook up, go to a singles bar.” There is literally no space to unfold my sleeping bag. I ask around for help. Out of nowhere, a man pushing a shopping cart with his friend inside rammed the thing “Jackass”-style into a police barrier and walked off laughing like a hyena. A woman emerges from a makeshift tent that looks more like a layer cake — a clear tarp draped over a sleeping bag that is on top of a filthy mattress. It even has a welcome mat missing the “m” and the stench of a vagrant. “There’s not much space left,” she said and walked off into the darkness. Every camp tent is like its own state. There is “Camp Anonymous,” the group best known for anti-Scientology protests. It’s neighbored by a tent full of vampires, the “Class War” tent and the “Occupy Paw Street” tent, whose residents hand out treats to occupying pets. There’s also “Camp France” and the “Nic at Night” tent, which supplies the protest with smokes. I settle on a sliver near Broadway by an OWS library — which frighteningly has a children’s section. On a bulletin board, there are personal messages like, “Call your sister!” I’m wedged between a newbie from Brooklyn and some guy from Toronto, who preferred the experience of urban camping to his buddy’s couch or a hotel. “My knees will crush you,” a hulking squatter shouts. “I don’t want to hurt you. “You’re in my doorway. I’m going to crush you.” Someone takes offense and yells, “Manners!” He’s much kinder when he emerges later from his green tent and hands me a shiny Mylar blanket for extra warmth. “It’s going to get cold,” he said. This spirit of generosity and the naivete of the original OWS protesters is devolving into a state of distrust and paranoia, however. They speak of theft, about government infiltrators and tales of Rikers Island castoffs being dropped off to roam and ravage the site. From underneath my blanket, I hear allegations of financial corruption and intimidation over sexual orientation. “I’m in a tent that keeps getting flooded, ransacked and robbed,” fumes a transgender group leader — a female who identifies as a male. He said that the transgender group would create its own police force for transgender protesters and females, since an immense distrust loomed over the OWS-created authority. That group is also demanding financial transparency amid growing concern over the use of the $750,000 war chest. They have a point. I notice supply-station cupboards are dangerously lacking any blankets, tents, tarps or Mylar. “Someone forgot to get that stuff out of storage,” an attendant claimed. “We have three-quarters of a million dollars in the bank and all these f–king people are not doing financial accounting while we’re calling for it from the larger corporations,” says the transgender leader. “A lot of good people are quitting.” A day later, a female-only “safety tent” would be erected to shield women from predators. Organizers plan to add a medical tent, as well as others designed to provide safe sleeping for gay, transgender and co-ed groups. The threat of rape is very real here — for women and men. Sitting in the McDonald’s just moments after Bezabeh was hauled off in cuffs, Lauren DiGioia, 26, tells me about how she became one of the growing number of victims on her very first night in the park. “I was forced into a very tight space,” she says. “He kind of moved up against me. “ ‘Oh, let me warm you up. It’s cold out here,’ ” the creep told her, she said. “He kept pursuing me, and he started becoming aroused, and I could tell that he was becoming aroused,” she said. “I just tried to shield myself.” He allegedly groped her, pulled her and tried to get on top of her. “I kept thinking to myself, ‘In the morning, I am going to get this guy arrested,’ but in the morning, he was gone,” she said. DiGioia, who is from Clifton, NJ, was shocked to see her alleged attacker’s image in The Post about a week later — and she identified him to the police. She is now offering counsel to other victims, as new ones crop up every day. “I just talked to two gentlemen who were raped last night, and they don’t want to press charges because [authorities] wanted to take them in an ambulance and . . . do a rape kit,” she said. She passed on their account to the security force, while encouraging them to press charges. “There was another girl raped by the same man,” she said from a table in the McDonald’s, which has become the headquarters of the revolution. It’s a place to meet, to get warm, to scarf down dollar-menu grub and to use the bathroom that becomes increasingly vile as the night goes on. I’m ultimately invited to spend the night in a Camp Anonymous tent instead of solo in a sleeping bag. I spend the rest of the night awake against the wall of a tent built for four — but packed with six. My bunkmates include an anarchist, a sexual-assault victim, two security-force members, a girl dressed like the devil and her kitten — the “Anarkitty.” “We are a microcosm of all of society’s defects and the failing economy,” DiGioia said. “Just because we’re here under a microscope, everybody’s going to come and throw up their arms and say we have to shut this place down.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Another “black” activist has admitted to being a white person. Satchuel Cole, a community organizer for Black Lives Matter in Indiana, fessed up to the years-long ruse in a Facebook post last week — and vowed to “seek help.” “Friends, I need to take accountability for my actions and the harm that I have done. My deception and lies have hurt those I care most about. I have taken up space as a Black person while knowing I am white. I have used Blackness when it was not mine to use. I have asked for support and energy as a Black person. I have caused harm to the city, friends and the work that I held so dear,” said Cole, 45, who was born a woman but identifies as non-binary. “I am sorry for the harm I have caused. I am sorry for the hurt and betrayal. I will do what I can to show that I want to be a better person,” she wrote. The mea culpa comes after an exposé published by BlackIndyLive, which ran yearbook photos of Cole’s white parents, and produced documents showing Cole once listed her race as “white.” The outlet also revealed Cole’s birth name — Jennifer Benton — and reported that Cole’s parents listed their races as “white” in legal documents. Cole’s name legally changed in 2010, according to the outlet. Around that time, Cole’s profile as an activist began to take off. In 2017, Cole was appointed vice-president of a well-known, but now defunct, equal-rights organization, Don’t Sleep, and was also named spokesperson for the family of Aaron Bailey, who was shot and killed by Indianapolis police during a traffic stop. Cole, who also works as an apartment manager, is the latest among a string of white women who pretended to be black. Earlier this week, a grad student at the University of Wisconsin Madison, stepped down from her teaching position amid revelations she falsely posed as black and Latino. CV Vitolo-Haddad admitted in a Medium post she’s actually Southern Italian and Sicilian. Jessica Krug, a George Washington University African American studies professor, confessed her whiteness last month after years of posing as a black woman. She too publicly apologized. In 2015, Rachel Dolezal, a white woman from Washington state who rose the ranks of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was forced to step down when her parents blew her cover.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The US Senate passed a bill aimed at tracking anti-Asian hate crimes Thursday by an overwhelming majority of 94-1 — with Sen. Josh Hawley the lone “no” vote. The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act would direct the Justice Department to expedite its review of anti-Asian racist harassment and attacks — which have spiked nationwide during the coronavirus pandemic — and to coordinate with local law enforcement to bolster reporting of those incidents. The House is expected to vote on the bill next month. In a statement, Hawley (R-MO) criticized the bill as “too broad.” “As a former prosecutor, my view is it’s dangerous to simply give the federal government open-ended authority to define a whole new class of federal hate crime incidents,” he said. In a referendum on the bill last week, 92 senators voted for it and six Republicans voted against, Hawley among them. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI), who authored and introduced the bill, said in a statement Thursday, “We will send a powerful message of solidarity to the AAPI community that the Senate won’t be a bystander as anti-Asian violence surges in our country.” Reports of Anti-Asian hate crimes have surged across the United State in the past year. In New York City, at least two Asian people reported racist incidents to the police just this week. On Tuesday, a man on the subway screamed at a 28-year-old Asian woman, “F–k you, you Asian b—h! Don’t f–k with me! I’m gonna slap you!’” And on Monday, a 31-year-old man was punched in the face unprovoked in Midtown around 11:30 p.m., according to the NYPD. Hawley on Thursday appeared focused on other aspects of the coronavirus. Hours earlier, the Missouri Republican and Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) introduced the COVID-19 Origin Act of 2021 to the Senate. Hawley says the act requires the Biden administration to “declassify intelligence related to any potential links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origins of the COVID pandemic.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Feminist Stalwart versus Transgender Icon: It may sound like a warped new comic strip, but really it’s the first installment in what could be a series of very real conflicts between warring politically correct factions. Germaine Greer, the 76-year-old author of “The Female Eunich,” is making waves by lambasting the idea that Caitlyn Jenner may be honored by Glamour Magazine as “Woman of the Year.” Jenner isn’t a woman, says Greer. He’s just attention-starved and seeking to steal the limelight from the women in the Kardashian family. He hasn’t actually had to endure what feminists depict as the true horrors of womanhood, such as being cursed with what Greer delicately characterizes as a “big, hairy, smelly vagina.” When told that such comments are hurtful to the transgender community, Greer doubled down. “Try being an old woman. For goodness sake, people get hurt all the time, I’m not about to walk on eggshells.” Those who have long walked on eggshells trying not to offend Greer’s feminist sisters should feel free to laugh. For decades, feminists have skillfully wielded their victimhood status as a weapon, drawing it and striking public figures who fail to follow their obscure, but strictly enforced, rules. Use the word “bossy,” “silly,” “hysterical,” “shrill,” mention that women bear children or fail to mention that women bear children and you might face the wrath of the PC feminist police. Now their tactics are being turned on one of their own. Campus feminists seek to stomp out diversity; they’ve been leaders in harassing universities into rescinding speaking invitations given to those who don’t sufficiently toe the liberal line. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the International Monetary Fund’s Christine Lagarde, activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali and the American Enterprise Institute’s Christina Hoff Summers are just a few who have been successfully disinvited from university gigs because they failed the campus’ political-correctness test. Now Greer’s the target for these liberal censors, as Cardiff University is being petitioned to ax her upcoming lecture there, “Women & Power: The Lessons of the 20th Century.” And feminists support the censorship. As Kaite Welsh wrote: “Isn’t it often the way? You fight your way from the trenches to the throne, overthrow the corrupt regime and set about remaking the world in your own image, only to realize that you have become the thing you most despised.” Greer’s gone from “revolutionary to oppressor,” she said. Unsurprisingly, Greer sees sexism at the root of the celebration of Caitlyn Jenner: “I think misogyny plays a really big part in all of this, that a man who goes to these lengths to become a woman will be a better woman than someone who is just born a woman.” Greer is missing bigger drivers of the Caitlyn phenomenon. Our insatiable media must find new ground to break in tantalizing the public and normalizing what was once considered aberrant behavior. Cultivating a live-and-let-live attitude isn’t enough; alternative lifestyles must be celebrated as not only equal but superior to the boring, oppressive traditions that have dominated until now. Yet Greer also uncovers an aspect of the transgendered phenomenon that feminists really ought to find disconcerting. It’s more than just a rival victim group, but one that threatens to expose feminists’ contradictions when it comes to sex differences. Feminists typically deny that meaningful gender differences exist between men and women, while allowing that there are some areas in which women are superior to men. Women are better at consensus building, listening, languages . . . but don’t anyone dare imply that men may have an innate edge in any hard science. Ask former Harvard University President Larry Summers how that one turns out. Surely Greer doesn’t actually care whom Glamour magazine honors as woman of the year. (Aren’t old-school feminists supposed to object to such beauty-obsessed rags anyway?) Yet what happens when transgender women start competing against plain old women in other areas of life? Say, in tennis matches and swim meets? Or how about for slots on corporate boards and in top universities looking to meet targets for gender balance? Feminists may find their cause stalled and themselves forced to acknowledge that biology plays a bigger role than they care to admit. The Germaine Greer and Caitlyn Jenner brouhaha is surely, taken on its own, a tempest in a teapot. But it’s the culmination of a PC culture that may be beginning to implode.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Verizon has been quietly scrambling to unload HuffPost as it grapples with continued losses at the left-leaning news and culture website, The Post has learned. The telecom giant — which acquired the site formerly known as the Huffington Post as part of its $4.4 billion purchase of AOL in 2015 — has approached multiple digital-media companies during the past few months in a bid to get the property off its books as losses accelerate due to the coronavirus, according to sources close to the situation. Verizon has pitched the property to prospective buyers including Thrillist-owner Group Nine Media, Rolling Stone publisher Penske Media Corp., Bustle Digital Media and J2 Global, insiders said. Those media outlets declined to comment. Vox Media, which owns New York Magazine and operates news and political site Vox as well as tech news sites Recode and The Verge, is among the media outlets to have held talks to acquire HuffPost. Some sources have described those talks as “serious,” but sources close to Vox, while acknowledging they have taken a look, say they are not interested in buying the property. Even Group Nine — whose CEO is Ben Lerer, the son of Huffington Post co-founder Ken Lerer — took a pass, according to a source close to the situation. “This thing loses so much money,” a digital media executive with knowledge of the financials said. “It’s such a mess, I wouldn’t touch it with a 10-foot pole. I don’t think there’s any way you can make money.” People briefed on the talks said Verizon, headed by CEO Hans Vestberg, appears to be seeking to offload HuffPost to a buyer willing to take a knife to the site’s high operating expenses — a potentially daunting process that would require going head-to-head with the site’s union and enacting “massive layoffs,” sources said. While HuffPost brings in between $45 million to $50 million a year in revenue, its annual expenses are between $60 million and $70 million, two sources said. And with advertising slammed by the pandemic, it will likely bring in $40 million this year, the sources said. Verizon is looking to maintain a minority stake while the buyer “does the dirty work” of cutting costs and dealing with severance packages, one source opined. He estimated that roughly one-third to a half of HuffPost’s staff would need to be cut to enable any buyer to “break even” on the deal. According to the company’s masthead, HuffPost has roughly 200 employees. HuffPost’s editorial staff is unionized with the Writer’s Guild of America East. Other challenges include a “toxic culture” among staffers that’s plagued by “distrust in the organization” and “in-fighting” over how “left” the publication should be, one source said. “Who wants to buy ads on the thing? Nobody. If Verizon can’t make money on it, who can?,” the source said. “And, you have to fire half the people? There goes the traffic. The brand means nothing anymore and it’s ultra-partisan.” Founded by Arianna Huffington in 2005, HuffPost began as a counterpart to conservative sites like Drudge Report. In 2016, Lydia Polgreen took the reins as top editor from Huffington, who left to build a wellness and lifestyle company, Thrive Global. In March, Polgreen left to head up content for Spotify’s podcasting company, Gimlet Media. The company has yet to name Polgreen’s replacement. Verizon didn’t respond to requests for comment on Monday. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get updates on the 2020 presidential election and more. President Trump is one vote closer to victory in the all-important battleground state of Florida — after casting his own ballot there Saturday morning. The president, who changed his official address from New York to the Sunshine State last year, took advantage of Florida’s early-voting law to mark his ballot in person at the Main Library in West Palm Beach. He spent Friday night at his nearby Mar-a-Lago resort after spending the day on the campaign trail in his new home state. “I voted for a guy named Trump,” he told reporters. “But it’s an honor to be voting,” he said. “It was very secure, vote much more secure than when you send in a ballot, I can tell you.” A small crowd of supporters was there to greet him, waving Trump campaign banners and American flags. Florida and its 29 Electoral College votes is a must-win for Trump, who took it by a single percentage point in 2016. Polls show Democrat Joe Biden with a slim — though narrowing — 1.5% lead in Florida, according to RealClearPolitics. The president has hit the campaign trail there with a vengeance, with four Florida rallies in the last two weeks. Early voting, both by mail and in person, has taken on outsized importance this year amid the coronavirus pandemic. As of Friday, with 12 days to go until Election Day, 4.8 million Floridians had already voted — 34% of the state’s registered electorate. Democrats took an early lead in the vote-by-mail category, building up a 569,000-vote advantage in returned ballots, according to the US Elections Project. But Republicans — heeding Trump’s repeated warnings about mail-in voter fraud — surged to the polls this week when in-person early voting began. Vice President Mike Pence has also voted early, dropping off his absentee ballot Friday in Indianapolis, Ind. while on a midwest campaign swing. Trump headed to Lumberton, NC, after casting his ballot for the first of three Saturday campaign rallies. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. As the Biden Administration plans to push the nation’s schools to teach civics lesson more in line with the New York Times’ factually challenged 1619 project, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has written a letter to Secretary of Education Dr. Miguel Cardona: Dear Secretary Cardona: We write to express grave concern with the Department’s effort to reorient the bipartisan American History and Civics Education programs, including the Presidential and Congressional Academies for American History and Civics and the National Activities programs, away from their intended purposes toward a politicized and divisive agenda. A 2020 survey found that only 51% of Americans can name the three branches of our federal government. A 2019 study found that majorities of Americans in 49 states and the District of Columbia would earn an “F” on the U.S. Citizenship Exam. The most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress found that just 15% of American eighth-graders are “proficient” in U.S. history. School closures during the COVID-19 pandemic have almost certainly intensified these problems by triggering substantial learning losses, particularly for students from underserved backgrounds. Meanwhile, as powerful institutions increasingly subject Americans to a drumbeat of revisionism and negativity about our nation’s history and identity, American pride has plummeted to its lowest level in 20 years. This is a time to strengthen the teaching of civics and American history in our schools. Instead, your Proposed Priorities double down on divisive, radical, and historically-dubious buzzwords and propaganda. For example, your Proposed Priorities applaud the New York Times’s “1619 Project.” This campaign to “reframe the country’s history, understanding 1619 as our true founding” has become infamous for putting ill-informed advocacy ahead of historical accuracy. Actual, trained, credentialed historians with diverse political views have debunked the project’s many factual and historical errors, such as the bizarre and inaccurate notion that preserving slavery was a primary driver of the American Revolution. One renowned historian called the project “so wrong in so many ways.” Citing this debunked advocacy confirms that your Proposed Priorities would not focus on critical thinking or accurate history, but on spoon-feeding students a slanted story. Americans do not need or want their tax dollars diverted from promoting the principles that unite our nation toward promoting radical ideologies meant to divide us. This trend is already sweeping through K-12 schools nationwide in absurd ways. In February, the Oregon Department of Education advertised an “anti-racist math” workshop run by an organization which teaches that “white supremacy culture shows up in math classrooms” when “the focus is only on getting the ‘right’ answer” and when “students are required to ‘show their work’ in only one way.” California’s new statewide model curriculum urges teachers to lead students in a “Unity Chant” that prays to Aztec deities for “decolonization.” Curriculum documents from New York discuss “cis-gender privilege” and “disrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family.” Families did not ask for this divisive nonsense. Voters did not vote for it. Americans never decided our children should be taught that our country is inherently evil. If your Administration had proposed actual legislation instead of trying to do this quietly through the Federal Register, that legislation would not pass Congress. In fact, your proposal would distort bipartisan legislation that was led by former Senators Lamar Alexander, Ted Kennedy, and Robert Byrd. The clear legislative intent was to equip young citizens with foundational knowledge about American history, a better understanding of our governing institutions, and more of the vibrant patriotism brought forth by a balanced assessment of our imperfect but exceptional nation. As the HELP Committee explained in 2003, “The committee recognizes how important it is for citizens to understand the principles that have united all Americans since our Nation’s founding. Most countries are united by a common ethnicity, but the United States is united by our commitment to these principles… Although America’s variety and diversity is a great strength, Americans’ greatest accomplishment is that we found unity amidst that variety and diversity.” That is the legislative intent that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for years. Young Americans deserve a rigorous understanding of civics and American history. They need to understand both our successes and our failures. But acknowledging that America’s journey has been a work in progress throughout our history cannot mean ignoring the tremendous strides we have made together. Our nation’s youth do not need activist indoctrination that fixates solely on past flaws and splits our nation into divided camps. Taxpayer-supported programs should emphasize the shared civic virtues that bring us together, not push radical agendas that tear us apart. We request that you withdraw these Proposed Priorities and refocus on civic education and American history programs that will empower future generations of citizens to continue making our nation the greatest force for good in human history.

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The letter was heartbreaking as it recounted the death of an 88-year-old woman in a New York nursing home. But it was also angry and accurate about a strange New York policy that is ­fatally wrongheaded. “I am wondering who will hold Gov. Cuomo accountable for the deaths of so many older people due to his reckless decision to place covid19 patients in nursing and rehabilitation homes,” the letter began. “I am writing as a daughter who lost her beautiful 88 year old mother who was receiving physical therapy at one such facility.” The writer, Arlene Mullin, went on to recount examples of the governor promising to protect the elderly because of their known vulnerability. She noted that he named his stay-at-home order after his own mother, Matilda ­Cuomo, and talked several times about protecting her. “My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable and our brothers and sisters are not expendable,” Cuomo said a month ago. Mullin had another complaint, too — that the media never asked the governor about an order mandating that nursing homes admit and readmit patients who tested positive for the coronavirus, despite the extraordinary number of deaths among the elderly. That drought ended Monday when The Post’s Bernadette Hogan asked about the policy at ­Cuomo’s daily briefing. His ­answer was stunning. “That’s a good question. I don’t know,” the governor said. He turned to Howard Zucker, the state health commissioner, who confirmed the policy, saying “if you are positive, you should be admitted back to a nursing home. The necessary precautions will be taken to protect the other residents there.” The second part of Zucker’s answer is debatable, the first part is not. The disastrous results speak for themselves. The state concedes that 3,448 residents of nursing homes or adult-care facilities are known to have died from the coronavirus, or nearly 25 percent of all deaths in New York. More than 2,000 of the total are in the five boroughs, and officials acknowledge that the real numbers are almost certainly higher. The New York policy is especially odd given that the first large outbreak of the virus in the United States took place in a nursing home. The Life Care Center in Kirkland, Wash., attributed 13 deaths to the virus before March 11, and at the time, the number represented 60 percent of all the fatalities in the nation. Since then, at least 24 others have died there. That same week, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged that special attention be given to seniors. “It’s so clear that the overwhelming weight of serious disease and mortality is on those who are elderly and those with a serious comorbidity: heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, obesity, respiratory difficulties,” Fauci told the American Medical Association. He said there would always be exceptions but that “if you look at the weight of the data, the risk group is very, very clear.” Indeed, early reports from around the world showed that death rates from the virus soared with age. Among those who also had other major health issues, the rates were off the charts. For example, a study released in Italy on March 17 found that more than 99 percent of 355 coronavirus fatalities there suffered from other health issues. The average age of those who died was 79.5 years. Thus, it was well known that the elderly were easy targets for the coronavirus before New York adopted its Health Department directive on March 25 requiring nursing homes to accept those with the disease. Zucker’s Monday defense included his claim that the state is working with such facilities to protect other residents and health care workers by providing equipment and monitoring. Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Queens Democrat, harshly dismissed the claim as false. “It’s either he’s lying or they have absolutely no idea what’s ­going on on the ground,” Kim told The Post. For her part, Arlene Mullin is not satisfied. In an interview Tuesday, the Long Island educator said she has sent four emails to Cuomo’s office on the issue but has never received a response. “I get it, it’s a crisis,” she said of the pandemic. “But I really want to know why the governor would put that population at such risk.” Her mom, Diana Mongiello, a great-grandmother, was in a rehab center that had accepted coronavirus patients when she developed a fever on April 5. At 8 a.m. the next day, a nursed called to say Mongiello tested positive. Five hours later, she was pronounced dead. When I told Mullin of Cuomo’s answer — that he didn’t know about the policy — she was silent, then wondered: “What the heck were they ­thinking?” She still deserves an answer. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s streak of being worse than useless continues. Having nothing to do and little to say, he’s resorting to stunts to try to get attention. First he put out a nutty request for New Yorkers to snitch on those who don’t follow social-distance rules. The result was a deluge of middle fingers, penis pictures and profanity, The Post reports. Then he tried to invoke a headline from the 1970s, when the city needed a federal bailout. “Mr. President, are you going to save New York City, or are you telling New York City to drop dead?” It’s safe to assume nobody under 50 understood the reference. Tuesday, he vowed that New York is going to throw a ticker-tape parade for health care workers. He said it will be “the first thing we do” when the pandemic ends. Prediction: His next demand will be that the feds pay for the parade. Like pretty much everything else with Joe Biden, the campaign to become his running mate is getting weird. Stacy Abrams, who lost the Georgia governor’s race, is openly pushing for the spot, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren didn’t hesitate with her “yes” when asked if she was interested. Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s name keeps coming up, but there is one person in a class of her own: Michelle Obama. Party regulars, in a fit of nostalgia, are pushing to get her on the ticket and Biden himself said he’d take her “in a heartbeat.” Al Sharpton says he prays the former first lady will say yes. So far, though, Obama is sticking to the vow she made in her 2018 memoir. “I have no intention of running for office, ever,” she wrote then. For Biden, the rejection is par for the course. Many people want the spot, just not the one he wants. The World Health Organization said on Tuesday that all available evidence suggests that the novel coronavirus originated in bats in China late last year and it was not manipulated or constructed in a laboratory. Translation: This is what China told us to say. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Democrats convened in Charlotte, NC, will double down on their claim that Bain Capital is really the Bain crime family. They will accuse Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Bain’s other “greedy” co-founders of stealing their winnings, evading taxes and lighting cigars with $100 bills on their yachts. But Bain’s private-equity executives have enriched dozens of organizations and millions of individuals in the Democratic base — including some who scream most loudly for President Obama’s re-election. Government-worker pension funds are the chief beneficiaries of Bain’s economic stewardship. New York-based Preqin uses public documents, news accounts and Freedom of Information requests to track private-equity holdings. Since 2000, Preqin reports, the following funds have entrusted some $1.56 billion to Bain: * Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund ($2.2 million) * Indiana Public Retirement System ($39.3 million) * Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System ($177.1 million) * The Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension System ($19.5 million) * Maryland State Retirement and Pension System ($117.5 million) * Public Employees’ Retirement System of Nevada ($20.3 million) * State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio ($767.3 million) * Pennsylvania State Employees’ Retirement System ($231.5 million) * Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island ($25 million) * San Diego County Employees Retirement Association ($23.5 million) * Teacher Retirement System of Texas ($122.5 million) * Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System ($15 million) These funds aggregate the savings of millions of unionized teachers, social workers, public-health personnel and first responders. Many would be startled to learn that their nest eggs are incubated by the company that Romney launched and the financiers he hired. Leading universities have also profited from Bain’s expertise. According to Infrastructure Investor, Bain Capital Ventures Fund I (launched in 2001) managed wealth for “endowments and foundations such as Columbia, Princeton and Yale universities.” According to BuyOuts magazine and S&P Capital IQ, Bain’s other college clients have included Cornell, Emory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Notre Dame and the University of Pittsburgh. Preqin reports that the following schools have placed at least $424.6 million with Bain Capital between 1998 and 2008: * Purdue University ($15.9 million) * University of California ($225.7 million) * University of Michigan ($130 million) * University of Virginia ($20 million) * University of Washington ($33 million) Major, center-left foundations and cultural establishments also have seen their prospects brighten, thanks to Bain Capital. According to the aforementioned sources, such Bain clients have included the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the Doris Duke Foundation, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Ford Foundation, the Heinz Endowments and the Oprah Winfrey Foundation. Why on Earth would government-union leaders, university presidents and foundation chiefs let Bain oversee their precious assets? “The scrutiny generated by a heated election year matters less than the performance the portfolio generates to the fund,” California State Teachers’ Retirement System spokesman Ricardo Duran said in the Aug. 12 Boston Globe. CalSTRS has pumped some $1.25 billion into Bain. Since 1988, Duran says, private-equity companies like Bain have outperformed every other asset class to which CalSTRS has allocated the cash of its 856,360 largely unionized members. Is Bain really a gang of corporate buccaneers who plunder their ill-gotten gains by outsourcing, euthanizing feeble portfolio companies and giving cancer to the spouses of those whom they fired? If so, union bosses, government retirees, liberal foundations and elite universities thrive on the wages of Bain’s economic Darwinism. If, however, these institutions relish the yields that Bain Capital generates by supporting start-ups and rescuing distressed companies, 80 percent of which have prospered, then this money is honest — and Team Obama isn’t.

President Trump said Saturday he’s pleased Democrats marked his first year in office by giving him a government shutdown. “This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown,” Trump tweeted at 6:33 a.m. He was being only a little bit sarcastic — Trump and his fellow Republicans do see the shutdown as a gift. Trump hopes voters will blame the shutdown on Democrats, and choose more Republicans in this year’s midterm elections. “Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!” Trump tweeted at 6:17 a.m. A bigger Republican majority is the best fix to the political squabbling that led to the shutdown, Trump said. “For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military & Veterans!” he wrote at 6:44 a.m., followed by the catchphrase “#AMERICA FIRST!” Hours later, he wrapped up his morning Twitter session with one last salvo at his Senate foes. “Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration,” he posted at 9:27 am. “Can’t let that happen!” Late Friday night, the Senate failed to approve a temporary spending bill, forcing a government shutdown on the anniversary of President Trump’s inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence also attributed the shutdown to the Democrats in comments to reporters early Saturday. “We have soldiers that are headed down range to Kuwait for six months in a critical theater to serve the country, and yet because of Democrats in the Senate, they have anxiety about their pay.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "News By Bruce Golding April 11, 2017 | 10:07am The passenger hauled off a United flight is a lung doctor with a taste for gambling, a history of angry outbursts — and a conviction for trading narcotics prescriptions and cash for gay sex in motels. Dr. David Dao of Elizabethtown, Ky., confirmed Tuesday that he was the inadvertent star of a viral video stirring outrage around the globe and said he was undergoing hospital treatment in Chicago. In an interview from his bed, Dao, 69, told Louisville TV station WLKY that he wasn’t feeling well. When asked what hurt, the married grandfather from Vietnam answered, “Everything,” the station reported. His lawyers later released a statement saying Dao’s family “wants the world to know that they are very appreciative of the outpouring of prayers, concern and support they have received. “Currently, they are focused only on Dr. Dao’s medical care and treatment,” the statement added. Dao’s own medical license was suspended in 2003 following his arrest on charges including unlawful prescribing and trafficking in a controlled substance. He was accused of providing prescriptions for Vicodin and other narcotics to a former patient he later hired as his office manager, who was identified in news reports at the time as Brian Case. The men repeatedly hooked up in motels, with Dao paying Case around $200 each time and also sharing in the drugs, according to a 130-page file compiled by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure. On the day he was busted, Dao was secretly videotaped with Case in a Red Carpet Inn in Jefferson County, Ky., “with his shirt off and his pants undone,” the records say. Dao was convicted after a trial and sentenced to five years’ probation after the judge agreed to suspend a prison term of two-plus years recommended by the jury. He agreed to surrender his medical license in 2005, but had it provisionally reinstated in 2015 so he could work one day a week for another doctor in Elizabethtown. The licensing records also reveal how Dao was “the subject of many complaints” while working at Hardin Memorial Hospital. The Medical Executive Committee there “took a strong stance in 2002, and put [Dao] on a corrective action plan due to his disruptive behavior” and referred him “for evaluation and anger management,” the papers say. Since 2006, he’s won nearly $235,000 playing tournament poker, taking home $1,191 in one January contest, according to the World Series of Poker website. With Post wires",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton hasn’t been frog-marched from the Russell Senate Office Building — yet. To believe the Arkansan’s harshest critics, that’s only because felonious traitors don’t get the punishment they deserve. Cotton wrote an open letter to the leaders of Iran pointing out true and obvious things about our constitutional system, and the world came crashing down on his head. Disgracing the Senate, per a hyperventilating Vice President Joe Biden, was the least of his supposed offenses. He was aiding Iranian hard-liners, violating the Logan Act against subverting US foreign policy and committing an act of treason. If there were any doubt about the latter, the Daily News ran a picture of him and fellow Republican letter-signers with the subtle headline “TRAITORS.” Cotton’s alleged sedition is hard to fathom. It’s not as though he wrote secret letters to the Iranians (that’s what President Obama has made a practice of doing). It’s not as though he traveled to a foreign country to glad-hand a foreign thug in an express effort to undermine the president’s foreign policy (that’s what then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi did when she went to Damascus and met with Bashar Assad). Cotton wrote a letter and posted it on his website. As The New Republic’s Brian Beutler pointed out, the letter is functionally indistinguishable from an op-ed. It’s a trope among Cotton’s critics that he is allying himself with Iran’s hard-liners. This is a hilarious plaint after Obama went out of his way in 2009 to say nothing when the Iranian regime was crushing the country’s true moderates, out in the streets in the short-lived Green Revolution. It is Obama who has been wooing the most powerful hard-liner in Iran, unless we are supposed to believe that Ayatollah Khamenei is now a moderate. The contents of Cotton’s letter shouldn’t have been news to anyone. If the mullahs weren’t already aware that there is bipartisan opposition in Congress to any likely deal and the agreement won’t have the force of a treaty, they need to watch more C-SPAN and read up on the US Constitution. It is inarguable that, as a matter of domestic law, a subsequent president can get out of the agreement at will and Congress can pass laws in contravention of the agreement, if a president will sign them. If these are things the Iranians don’t know, and John Kerry hasn’t let them in on the joke, shouldn’t someone tell them? The foreign-policy debate in the Age of Obama is the world turned upside down. In the president’s transposition of the norms of American foreign policy, inviting the leader of a close ally to address Congress is an affront, and forging a — to put it gently — highly generous deal with an enemy is such an urgent necessity that no one should say a discouraging word. A more confident administration would have brushed off Speaker John Boehner’s invitation to Bibi Netanyahu, as well as the Cotton letter. The Obama administration is so defensive because it has a lot to be defensive about. It has been outnegotiated by the Iranians. Once, we wanted to prevent Iran from having a nuclear-weapons capability. Once, we wanted zero enrichment, and so did the United Nations. Those goals have long since been abandoned by an Obama administration desperate for any deal so it can include an opening to Iran among the president’s legacy achievements. So, here’s my own seditious foray into interfering with the conduct of US foreign policy: To Whom It May Concern in Tehran, You’re unlikely to ever encounter someone this weak and credulous again in the Oval Office. The president used to say that no deal is better than a bad deal. Now, that line is inoperative. It’s any deal is better than no deal, and woe to anyone who dares say otherwise. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Florida will not be allowed to enforce a controversial law that would have enabled individuals to sue big tech companies over censorship, a federal judge ruled. The law — which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law in May, claiming it would protect free speech — would have allowed individuals to sue social media companies if they feel they have been “unfairly censored.” Under the law, the state also could fine platforms thousands of dollars for each day they suspended or banned political candidates. The bill only applied to large social media firms like Facebook and Twitter and contained an exemption for internet platforms “operated by a company that owns and operates a theme park or entertainment complex” — a provision that critics said was designed to placate companies like Disney and NBCUniversal that are crucial to the state’s tourism sector. In a preliminary injunction issued Wednesday, Northern District of Florida judge Robert L. Hinkle blocked the state from enforcing nearly all parts of the law, writing, “Balancing the exchange of ideas among private speakers is not a legitimate governmental interest.” “[The law] discriminates on its face among otherwise-identical speakers: between social-media providers that do or do not meet the legislation’s size requirements and are or are not under common ownership with a theme park,” Hinkle added. “The legislation does not survive strict scrutiny.” Gov. DeSantis’ office told The Post that it will fight the decision. “We plan to immediately appeal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals,” said DeSantis Press Secretary Christina Pushaw. “Gov. DeSantis continues to fight for freedom of speech and against Big Tech’s discriminatory censorship.” Wednesday’s injunction was prompted by a suit filed just days after the bill was signed into law by two trade groups — NetChoice and the Computer and Communications Industry Association — that represent big tech companies including Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon. In a statement Wednesday, NetChoice vice president and general counsel Carl Szabo praised the decision. “When the State’s own lawyers can’t explain how the law works or even identify to whom it applies, there’s just no way that Florida’s enforcement of that law would keep users, creators, and advertisers safe from the tidal wave of offensive content and hate speech that would surely ensue,” said Szabo in a statement.

A group of flag-burning anti-NYPD protesters needed New York’s Finest to save their skin from a gang of angry bikers who tried to pummel them in a Brooklyn park for setting Old Glory ablaze Wednesday. The fiery stunt by a few dozen members of the group Disarm the Police led to a chaotic scene at about 8 p.m. in Fort Greene Park, when the activists enraged 40 members of the Hallowed Sons Motorcycle Club by roasting the flag on a tiny barbecue grill. “They took off like little b—hes,” said one biker. “They lit the f–king flag and took off running once they got slapped once or twice.” The anarchists had announced on social media that they had planned to burn the flag in protest of NYPD policies, drawing a large group of flag-waving counterprotesters, including the bikers. While it’s illegal to openly burn anything in Fort Greene Park, the self-styled anarchists managed to find a loophole in the law that allows cooking in closed barbecue grills. Thus, they started to roast the flag, but they didn’t burn it for long. One of the bikers rushed forward in a fit of rage and kicked over the grill, sending embers flying. He then doused it as members of the pro-flag crowd chanted “USA! USA!” The bikers then started trying to rough up the protesters — who were quickly saved by members of the same police force that they criticize. The protesters were shielded by the cops and escorted out of the park. “I served in the Marines,” said counterprotester Brian Christopher, 23. “We defend this flag. We are ready to die for it. When I see people burning it and showing complete ignorance, it’s very offensive.” No arrests were made in the scuffle, and the group’s flag-burning stunt went up in smoke. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The storming of the US Capitol yesterday by a group of fired-up Trump supporters was a tragedy for the Republican party, for conservatives and populist nationalists, and for Donald Trump and his legacy. It has bestowed the great gift of the moral high ground on the most undeserving people in the world: Joe Biden and the left. They now have a free pass to persecute their ideological enemies while enacting their pet cultural Marxist projects and changing this country irrevocably for the worst. They will be unimpeded by a Senate now in Democratic control, thanks to Tuesday’s Georgia runoff debacle. For Georgia, we can blame Trump’s irrational efforts to overturn the November election result, and a clueless GOP establishment which offered Peach State voters two candidates so cartoonishly wrong for the times they may as well have begged the MAGA base to stay home. A guy who made his money outsourcing jobs to China, and a wealthy elitist with a fake southern accent. What were they thinking? Trump’s sabotage of the Georgia runoffs and his rabble-rousing “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington yesterday were a catastrophe for his followers. They have justified the outlandish criticism of his enemies for the past four years. His good works will be undone, and no one will be there to protect them. He will be gone, and his people will reap the whirlwind. The footage of yesterday’s Capitol break-in will be played on eternal loop by Trump-hating media as evidence that the populist nationalist movement which propelled Trump to power was a dangerous aberration that must never be allowed to rise again. Of course, it was wrong for pro-Trump protesters to break into the U.S. Capitol and wander around with their flags. They shouldn’t have trespassed and fought police and broken windows. Those selfies they took on the House floor — or in the case of one bearded man, sitting in House Speaker’s Nancy Pelosi’s evacuated office with his feet on her desk — were dumb and self-incriminating. I hope they were worth it, because you know they won’t receive the kid-glove treatment that BLM-Antifa received with last year’s “mostly peaceful protests.” They didn’t throw bricks at police or burn police buildings to the ground or beat innocent passersby senseless. But they will have the book thrown at them, because it’s not the crime you commit that matters any more, it’s who you are. So, as bad as the Capitol Hill anarchy yesterday looked, we shouldn’t be surprised after the way leftist violence was condoned most of last year. You let the genie out of the bottle, there’s no telling where it goes. Joe Biden’s attempt at being a teleprompter statesman condemning the protests was laughable. Does he think we forgot he sat by benignly as his supporters torched American cities for months leading up to the election? Portland is still burning, not that you hear that on CNN. Suddenly the same politicians and media squawkers who turned a blind eye to actual violence, arson and murder are big advocates of “law and order.” Give me a break. Yesterday wasn’t all about overturning the election result, as much effort as Trump has put into that doomed project over the past two months. Frustration among his supporters has been building to boiling point for four years, as every power base conspired to subvert his 2016 election win and hobble his presidency. He was stymied until the end, and this is the result. But becoming what you hate isn’t the answer. Nor is burning down the Republican Party in the vain hope that a new party more to your liking somehow will rise like a phoenix from the ashes. And nor is attacking Trump’s most loyal ally, without whom he probably never would have been elected, Mike Pence. There were a lot of egregious moments yesterday but the probably the most unfair was when Pence became MAGA enemy No. 1. There even was a call for the Capitol invaders to “arrest” the vice -president. That is entirely Trump’s fault. He has been bullying, cajoling and gaslighting Pence to help him out of the dead end he found himself in with two weeks to Inauguration Day. Trump referred to Pence no fewer than seven time in his rally speech on the Ellipse yesterday. “I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do.” But Pence quite properly refused the demand he block Congress’ confirmation of Biden as president yesterday. Almost half of all voters, including 69 percent of Republicans, don’t believe Biden won the November election fairly, according to the latest Rasmussen poll. That’s a shocking vote of no confidence. But, having failed to prove your case in court after trying for two months, you can’t load the entire weight of unrealistic expectations onto Pence at the last minute. In his last days as president, Barack Obama honored Vice President Biden with the Medal of Freedom. In his last days as President, Trump kicked Pence in the teeth. It’s wrong and he should apologize for it along with everything else that happened yesterday. He has two weeks left to persuade his supporters to put the 2020 election behind them and focus on the real fight ahead, winning back the House in 2022, and the White House in 2024. Everything else is a distraction. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Saving the planet has never been so easy. The Paris climate talks concluded in a rousing round of self-congratulation over an agreement that, we are told, is the first step toward keeping the Earth habitable. If generating headlines and press releases about making history were the metric for anything, Paris might be as consequential — if misbegotten — as advertised. The fact is that Paris is very meta. The agreement is about the agreement, never mind what’s in it or what its true legal force is: namely, nil. Paris is a legally binding agreement not to have legally binding limits on emissions. It might be the most worthless piece of paper since the Kellogg-Briand Pact outlawed war — about a decade prior to the outbreak of World War II. Politico reported that the talks were almost derailed at the last minute by the accidental insertion of the word “shall” deep in the text, which, by implying a legal obligation, was to be avoided at all costs (the US Senate would never give its assent to a legally binding treaty). The United States then scrambled to change the offending word to “should.” The Paris summit operated on the principle of CBDRILONCWRC, or “Common But Differentiated Responsibility In Light Of National Circumstances With Respective Capability.” That means nothing was actually mandated on anyone because that proved — understandably enough, dealing with all the countries in the world — completely unworkable. Instead, countries came up with so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. That’s climate bureaucratese for you make up your emissions target, whatever it is, and we will pretend to take it seriously. Thus do the waters recede and the Earth is saved from looming climate catastrophe. Even if you believe the extremely dubious proposition that somehow the climate “consensus” perfectly understands perhaps the most complicated system on the planet, and can forecast with certitude and in detail what the global temperature will be a century from now, Paris is a charade. The best estimates are that, accepting the premises of the consensus, the deal will reduce warming 0.0 to 0.2 degrees Celsius. President Obama praised 180 countries for coming to Paris “with serious climate targets in hand.” This was ridiculous climate grade inflation. As Oren Cass of the Manhattan Institute points out, Pakistan produced a one-page document promising to “reduce its emissions after reaching peak levels to the extent possible.” For this we needed a headline-grabbing global confab? No one will mistake Pakistan for an industrial juggernaut. How about China, the world’s largest carbon emitter? It promises to reach peak emissions around 2030, when one US government study estimates that it would hit peak emissions anyway, Cass notes. The more China promises to confront climate change, the more it stays the same. India’s assurance that it will make a roughly 30 percent improvement in carbon intensity is, according to Cass, also about where it was projected to be headed anyway. India still wants to double its output of coal by 2020. As the Guardian put it, India “says coal provides the cheapest energy for rapid industrialization that would lift millions out of poverty.” That’s correct. The agreement’s celebrants believe that by making countries report their progress on cutting carbon emissions and by sending a stern signal against fossil fuels, Paris will catalyze painful cuts in carbon emissions somewhere off in the future. It speaks to a naive belief in the power of global shame over the sheer economic interest of developing countries in getting rich (and lifting countless millions out of poverty) through exploiting cheap energy — you know, the way Western countries have done for a couple of centuries. If this is the best hope of the climate alarmists, their global campaign will be a welcome fizzle.

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. You’ve been warned: The fate of the planet hangs in the balance if Kerry Kennedy is convicted of drugged driving in a New York trial that gets under way Monday. Robert F. “Bobby’’ Kennedy Jr., 60, called me the other day to plead for compassion for his misunderstood sister, a lawyer and professional human-rights activist born Mary Kerry Kennedy. “Kerry’s been instrumental in freeing political prisoners and dissidents from around the globe from imprisonment and torture,” Bobby told me. He argued that political agitators all over the world could be locked up and tortured if his sister, 54, is convicted in Westchester County for being hell on wheels. Africans might be tormented or killed for being gay. If convicted of driving while ability impaired by drugs — a misdemeanor — she fears she’ll be barred from entering countries like Canada, New Zealand and Australia, and thus be unable to perform her important work. Like her brother, Kerry is the child of slain Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Their uncle was President John F. Kennedy. Kerry is also the ex-wife of Gov. Cuomo. Last month, Kerry was on her way to meet her brother, a lawyer and environmental activist; their documentary filmmaker sister Rory, 45; and Bobby’s actress gal pal, Cheryl Hines, 48, at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah when she made an abrupt, globe-trotting ­U-turn. Kerry received an urgent call from South African social-rights activist Desmond Tutu, who asked her to fly to Africa immediately. At Kerry’s request, the retired Anglican bishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner had set up a meeting between Kerry and the president of the African nation of Uganda, who supposedly was about to sign into law the so-called “Kill the Gays” bill. So Kerry instead boarded a plane at JFK Airport and high-tailed it to Uganda’s capital city of Kampala, where, the story goes, she succeeded in saving the gays. “You’ve changed my mind. We can’t go on executing people because they were born that way,” Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni told Kerry, according to a friend of hers. Well, that’s one version of the story. “She has freed hundreds of political prisoners from Uganda to Nigeria to Kenya and Mexico because she has access because of her name,” Bobby enthused, adding, “That doesn’t mean she’s above the law.” Is Bobby loyal? Or delusional? I haven’t a clue what this world-saving business has to do with the case of a privileged woman and a highway smashup. I do know that Kerry could have hurt or killed someone, even herself, when she got behind the wheel of her silver 2008 Lexus SUV on the morning of July 13, 2012, allegedly while under the influence of the sleeping pill Ambien. She did, in fact, crash the vehicle into a tractor-trailer truck on Interstate 684 near her home in the tony town of Bedford and then continued driving. A motorist finally found her slumped over her vehicle’s steering wheel, unable to walk or see straight. Luckily, no one was injured. Kerry initially told a police officer that she might have mistakenly taken Ambien instead of her thyroid medication. Then, four days later, she stood outside the tiny Town of North Castle Justice Court in Armonk — the case has since moved to roomier quarters in White Plains — and announced that her doctors believed she suffered a “complex partial seizure” at the time of the wreck, caused by an earlier head injury. Wrong. Toxicology test results revealed that Kerry had ingested zolpidem tartrate, the generic term for Ambien. Her lawyers now contend that she innocently mixed up her pills. Kerry is president of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. But how effective is she at righting planetary wrongs? It turns out that Uganda’s gays never faced certain death. By the time an anti-gay bill had passed through the country’s legislative body in December, lawmakers had removed execution as punishment for certain homosexual acts and replaced it with penalties up to life in prison, still pretty harsh. When Kerry and members of her crew met with President Museveni on Jan. 18, he told the activists he would not sign a “fascist” anti-gay bill into law. Then he changed his mind. Museveni said through a spokesman on Feb. 14 that he intended to sign the bill “to protect Ugandans from social deviants.” President Obama condemned the measure. If convicted, Kerry could be sentenced to up to a year in jail, but a legal source said she’d likely be ordered by a judge to perform community service. Kerry plans to testify in her own defense at trial, giving observers a glimpse into the mind of a globe-trotting do-gooder. One who can’t own up to doing anything wrong. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. It would be fitting if Democrats undertook a radical procedural step to pass a radical piece of legislation. That’s what the left is pressuring Senate Democrats to do by eliminating, or significantly curtailing, the filibuster to pass HR1, the sweeping voting proposal that is one of the most execrable bills to pass the House in a very long time. HR1 would federalize the conduct of elections and codify what were supposed to be emergency voting procedures during the pandemic, in frankly partisan legislation sheathed in the rhetoric of “voting rights.” According to advocates of the bill, anything to tighten up or maintain good practices regarding ballot security is “voter suppression” worthy of the Jim Crow South. By this way of thinking, Republican efforts at the state level to, say, reduce the days available for early voting — a bill in Iowa would reduce early voting from its start 29 days before an election to 20 days before an election — would disenfranchise millions, never mind that deep-blue New York state only allows early voting 10 days before an election. Voter-identification laws, a bogeyman of supporters of HR1, were recommended by a 2005 bipartisan commission jointly led by Jimmy Carter and James Baker, neither of whom will ever be mistaken for Bull Connor. Not too long ago, it was a feature of big bipartisan voting bills to require states to periodically clean up their voter rolls, another common-sense measure that is now considered tantamount to wielding bully clubs and police dogs. There may be many problems besetting American democracy, but people turning out to vote isn’t one of them. Turnout exploded in the 2018 midterms, before the pandemic, and turnout exploded in 2020, during the pandemic, with both Democrats who availed themselves of early voting and Republicans who voted same-day showing up in historic numbers. In response largely to a non-problem, Democrats want to trample on the prerogatives of states to conduct elections, mandating their electoral priorities throughout the land. States would have no choice but to accept same-day registrations. People applying for various government programs or for college would be registered automatically. States couldn’t turn away the registrations of 16-year-olds, even though they can’t legally vote. States couldn’t require voter ID. They couldn’t remove inactive voters from the rolls. They couldn’t work with other states to try to find duplicate registrations six months ahead of an election. It would be pandemic-era mail-in voting forevermore, with no ID or witness signatures required and ballot-harvesting and drop boxes mandatory everywhere. Felons could no longer be barred from voting. The federal government would pay to train high-school students how to register people to vote and fund “campus voter coordinators” on campus, as well as giving colleges grants to register students. To truly bring home that the states are being divested of powers that go back to the founding of the republic, state legislatures would no longer draw congressional districts; instead, the task would be taken up by purportedly independent commissions. The FEC would no longer be bipartisan, and sundry provisions would prohibit or chill unwelcome political activity. That many Democrats say that the filibuster should fall for this bill is a symptom of the fevered state of the party, which, despite holding or winning every elected branch of the federal government, has conjured out of nothing a vast conspiracy to stop people from voting that allegedly justifies one of the most blatant federal power grabs in memory. Early voting isn’t going away, but there should be protections against potential abuses, and voting on Election Day should be encouraged — it’s the most secure and private, and least error-prone, way to vote. It’s a symptom of what a wrecking ball HR1 is that, in the course of mandating the opposite on all counts, it could kneecap both the states and a longstanding Senate procedure in one fell swoop.

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The Freelancers Union is ending its popular program that provides health insurance to thousands of its members — because the increase in rates resulting from ObamaCare is too expensive, according to a report. The union for independent workers, which provides low-cost insurance to more than 25,000 members in New York state, decided to eliminate its insurance plan because new federal regulations would force it to increase premiums by 14 percent, according to The New York Times. The union had been given a state one-year exemption from ObamaCare provisions, but announced Tuesday that the increase would conflict with its goal of providing low-cost insurance for its members, according to the report. Freelancers Union members went ballistic on social media after learning they would have to switch. Those who do nothing will wind up in Empire BlueCross BlueShield, and they will likely no longer have access to out-of-network doctors. “I’m infuriated,” Andrea Bertola Shaw wrote on Facebook. “I’ll be paying more and getting less coverage? What a joke.” Meanwhile, a federal judge in Oklahoma ruled that tax subsidies vital to the implementation of ObamaCare are unlawful. US District Judge Ronald White found the IRS rule that the Obama administration issued to set up tax-credit subsidies to help people pay insurance premiums was “an ­invalid implementation” of the law.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Just a couple of months ago, in the wake of Jared Loughner’s shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, simple talk of “targeting” a political opponent for defeat was treated as beyond the pale. But let’s look at some more recent language — and conduct — that our bien-pensant punditry can’t be bothered to notice, let alone condemn. In Michigan, protesters opposed to Gov. Rick Snyder’s austerity budget broke a window to get into the capitol building. One faces felony charges after assaulting police with an edged weapon; 14 were arrested. In Washington, DC, the windows at GOP headquarters were shot out, not the first time that Republican offices have been subject to such attacks. In Madison, Wis., the state capitol was occupied for weeks by teachers-union members and their supporters. Doors and windows were broken; a mob tried to keep Republican state senators from entering the Senate chamber to vote. And blogger Ann Althouse — a Wisconsin law professor who voted for Barack Obama — received nasty threats for the crime of posting video depicting this thuggish conduct on YouTube: “We will f— you up,” the threateners wrote. This was not the first threat she has received for her blogging. The GOP state senators who supported Gov. Scott Walker’s budget also received death threats, including an e-mail reading, in part: “I want to make this perfectly clear. Because of your actions today and in the past couple of weeks I and the group of people that are working with me have decided that we’ve had enough. We feel that you and your republican dictators have to die. “This is how it’s going to happen: I as well as many others know where you and your family live, it’s a matter of public records. We have all planned to assult [sic] you by arriving at your house and putting a nice little bullet in your head. “However, this isn’t enough. We also have decided that this may not be enough to send the message. So we have built several bombs that we have placed in various locations around the areas in which we know that you frequent. This includes, your house, your car, the state capitol, and well I won’t tell you all of them because that’s just no fun.” This threat was more credible because mobs of union protesters had already visited senators’ houses, screaming and banging on the windows. At the Huffington Post, liberal Lee Stranahan wonders why this kind of thing isn’t getting more attention from the traditional media who were tut-tutting over much more minor (and even imaginary) offenses to civility so very recently. “Ignoring the story of these threats is deeply, fundamentally wrong. It’s bad, biased journalism that will lead to no possible good outcome and progressives should be leading the charge against it. “Just before writing this article, I did a Google search and it’s stunning to find out that the right-wing media really isn’t exaggerating — proven death threats against politicians are being ignored by the supposedly honest media. If you’ve never agreed with a single thing that Limbaugh, Bill O’Reilly et al have said about anything, you can’t in any good conscience say that they don’t have a point here. Death threats are wrong and if a story like Wisconsin is national news for days, then so are death threats.” He’s right, but the big-media folks seem so anxious to peddle the same tired storyline — right-wingers are violent and ignorant, left-wingers are peaceful and virtuous — that they almost have to ignore anything that will spoil the narrative. But in doing this, they only undermine their own position more. Word still gets out — even to liberals at the Huffington Post. And people catch on: If there are big stories out there that traditional media won’t cover because it offends their storyline, then why listen to traditional media at all?

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. There’s more “Clinton Cash” trouble for Hillary. A report out Monday, “From Russia With Money — Hillary Clinton, the Russian Reset and Cronyism,” raises serious questions about the cash connections between the Clintons and participants in the State Department’s failed five-year effort to improve, or “reset,” US-Russia relations during Hillary’s reign as secretary of state. Key players in a main component of the reset — a Moscow-based, Silicon Valley-styled campus for developing biomed, space, nuclear and IT technologies called “Skolkovo” — poured tens of millions of dollars into the Clinton Foundation, the report by journalist Peter Schweizer alleges. As the Obama administration’s top diplomat, Hillary Clinton was at the center of US efforts on the reset in general and Skolkovo in particular, Schweizer argues. Yet, “Of the 28 US, European and Russian companies that participated in Skolkovo, 17 of them were Clinton Foundation donors” or sponsored speeches by former President Bill Clinton, Schweizer told The Post. “It raises the question — do you need to pay money to sit at the table?” In one example cited by Schweizer, Skolkovo Foundation member and then-Cisco CEO John Chambers donated between $1 million and $5 million in personal and corporate cash to the Clinton Foundation, the report says. But Skolkovo wound up making America less safe, Schweizer argues, because it shared advanced US technology that Russia can develop for both civilian and military applications, a concern raised already by Army and FBI officials. Many of Skolkovo’s research projects involved “dual-use” technologies, meaning they would have both civilian and military uses, the report said, citing one in particular — a hybrid airship called an “Atlant” developed at the Skolkovo Aeronautical Center. “Particularly noteworthy is Atlant’s ability to deliver military cargoes,” including “radar surveillance, air and missile defense and delivery of airborne troops,” the Skolkovo Foundation bragged in a document Schweizer cites. ‘Of the 28 US, European and Russian companies that participated in Skolkovo, 17 of them were Clinton Foundation donors.’ Hillary Clinton personally launched the State Department’s efforts toward a Russian reset, presenting her Russian then-counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, with a prop reset button in Geneva in 2009. The reset petered out by the end of 2011, when Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Hillary of fomenting Russian protests over suspicions of fraud in that year’s parliamentary elections. But by then, the damage had already been done, Schweizer feels. “I think the idea that you’re going to help develop a Russian version of Silicon Valley, which, by the way, will be controlled by the Russian government, and then not to expect that the technology will be siphoned off for military uses, is incredibly naive,” Schweizer said. As early as 2010, cybersecurity experts also expressed deep concerns about Russia using Skolkovo to develop hacking capabilities. Russia’s FSB spy agency — the successor to the KGB — reportedly keeps two of its information warfare “security centers” at Skolkovo, the report says. “There certainly is an irony that as we are now concerned about Russian cyber-attacks on the US, that the reset played a role in enhancing their cyber-capabilities,” Schweizer said. In this latest report, as in his book, “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,” Schweizer concedes he found no “smoking gun” evidence that any of the donors who poured cash into the Clinton coffers actually were promised, or received, any State Department favors in return. “We don’t have an email or a pirated voice mail message saying, ‘We’ll give you money if you help us with Skokovo,’” Schweizer told The Post. “But what we do have is a pattern that shows a high percentage of participants in Skolkovo who happen to be Clinton Foundation donors. “I think that everybody at the Russian reset table seems to walk away with something,” he added. “The Clintons, they get their donations and speaking fees in the millions of dollars. The Russians get access to advanced US technology. The tech companies [that participated in the reset, including Cisco, Intel, Microsoft] get special access to the Russian market and workforce. “But the American people get nothing. In fact, we get a rival — Russia — with enhanced technological capabilities. At best, that makes them a tougher competitor [in legitimate commerce],” Schweizer said. “At worst, they get a more robust military, with technologies that we helped develop, and that can be sold to our enemies.” The Clinton Foundation is sure to be a sore spot in Hillary’s campaign for the presidency, Schweizer predicted — tainted as it is, despite its laudable philanthropy. “At the entire Democratic convention, they did not mention the Clinton Foundation once,” he said. “And it’s been the Clintons’ life work for 16-plus years.” The Clinton campaign did not respond to requests from The Post for comment on the report. “All I ask is that people look at the money. Who made the deals, who benefited from the deals,” Schweizer said. “We can’t get inside people’s heads as to why they did something, but we should follow the money.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. WASHINGTON – Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was the lone House Democrat Wednesday to vote against leadership-backed bills to reopen the government because she opposes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement or additional border security measures. “We were having conversations with our community after we voted for DHS [Department of Homeland Security] funding the first time,” Ocasio-Cortez told The Post after House votes. “We’re hearing back a lot from our local community and they’re uncomfortable with any vote on funding for ICE.” Her Queens and Bronx district has a significant immigrant and Latino population and her constituents are already feeling pressure from ICE deportations. While she voted in favor of DHS funding in the past to reopen the government, after hearing from her voters, now she’s “a solid no for funding ICE at all,” spokesman Corbin Trent added. The first House-passed measure authorized funding to agencies at current levels through Feb. 28 and no extra money for President Trump’s border wall. It passed 229-184. Ocasio-Cortez joined with 183 Republicans in voting “no.” Ocasio-Cortez’s second “no” vote was on a larger appropriations package that funded agencies through the end of the fiscal year, but not the DHS. The bill passed 234-180 without Ocasio-Cortez’s support because it included $1.6 billion for border security-related measures like more immigration judges, investments in ports of entry and assistance for Central America. The second bill package got 10 GOP yes votes including New York Reps. Elise Stefanik and John Katko. The record-breaking government shutdown reached Day 33 on Wednesday.

The latest examples are the mobs in the streets across the country, demanding that employers pay a minimum wage of $15 an hour, or that the government makes them do so. Some gullible observers think the issue is whether what some people are making now is “a living wage.” This misconstrues the whole point of hiring someone to do work. Those who are being hired are paid for the value of the work they do. If their work is really worth more than what their employer is paying them, all they have to do is quit and go work for some other employer, who will pay them what their work is really worth. If they can’t find any other employer who’ll pay them more, then what makes them think their work is worth more? As for a “living wage,” the employer isn’t hiring people in order to acquire dependents and become their meal ticket. He’s hiring them for what they produce. Are some people unable to produce much? Absolutely! I was once one of those people. After leaving home as a teenager, I discovered that what I could earn would only enable me to rent a furnished room about 6 by 9 feet. Instead of a closet, it had a nail on the back of the door — which was completely adequate for my wardrobe at the time. It became painfully clear that there was no great demand for a high-school dropout with no skills and no experience. My choices were to get angry at my employer or to acquire some skills and experience — and try to pick up some more education, while I was at it. Even to a teenage dropout, that choice was a no-brainer. There was no one around to confuse the issue by telling me that I was somehow “entitled” to what other people had produced, whether at the expense of the taxpayers or the employer. There was a minimum-wage law, even back in those days. But it had been passed 10 years earlier, and inflation had raised both prices and wages to the point where it was the same as if there were no minimum-wage law. Thank heaven! The unemployment rate among black teens back then was a fraction of what it would become in later years, after “compassionate” politicians repeatedly raised the minimum-wage rate. In 1948, the year I left home, the unemployment rate among black 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds was 9.4 percent, slightly lower than that for white kids the same ages, which was 10.2 percent. Over the decades since then, we have gotten used to unemployment rates among black teenagers being over 30 percent, 40 percent or in some years even 50 percent. Such is the price of political “compassion.” Whatever the good intentions behind minimum-wage laws, what matters are the consequences. Many people have ideological or political incentives to obfuscate the consequences. Labor unions are the biggest force behind attempts to raise the minimum wage. That may seem strange, since most union members already earn more than the minimum wage. But the unions know what they’re doing, even if too many gullible observers do not. Low-skill workers with correspondingly low wages compete in the labor market with higher-skilled union members with correspondingly higher wages. Many kinds of work can be done by various mixtures of low- and high-skilled workers. Minimum-wage rates that are higher than what most low-skilled and inexperienced workers are worth simply price those workers out of the job markets, leaving more work for union members. All the unions have to do is camouflage what is happening by using rhetoric about “a living wage,” or “social justice” or whatever else will impress the gullible. Life was tough when all I could get were low-paying jobs. But it would’ve been a lot tougher if I couldn’t get any job at all. And a tough life made me go get some skills and knowledge.

Watching her son parade with rows of fellow troops, she notices he is on his left foot when they are all on the right. “Why are they out of step?” she asks. So it is with Barack Obama. The nation is turning against him, yet he shouts to the heavens that he is right and the country is wrong. Mothers can get away with that sort of thing. Presidents and their parties get shellacked. The Quinnipiac poll showing that Obama is now considered the worst president since World War II offers him no silver lining. There were 12 choices and the voting wasn’t close — he got the highest “worst” vote, 33 percent, with George W. Bush the next worst, at 28 percent. Jimmy Carter, routinely mocked as a disaster, drew only 8 percent. Even Richard Nixon did better, seen as the bottom of the barrel by only 13 percent of those surveyed. And we know how Nixon’s tenure ended. Too bad America didn’t come to its senses sooner. Indeed, the Q poll shows a huge amount of buyers’ remorse, with 45 percent saying Mitt Romney would have been a better president, while only 38 percent think Obama was the right choice in 2012. Mulligan, anyone? Let me be clear: Obama is flirting with disaster. This and other polls show he is losing ground with every group, including African-Americans. Most important, clear majorities no longer trust him and no longer believe he is capable of leading the country. His policies, especially ObamaCare, were never popular, but the accumulation of his failures has eroded his ability to defy political gravity. That’s what happens when you get caught in too many lies and broken promises about fixing the economy. And don’t underestimate the impact of the global chaos on Americans’ sour mood. Losing the consent of the governed is a profound event, and there is no easy path back to public grace. The one certainty is that Obama’s angry defiance will dig him a deeper hole. Let me be clear: Obama is flirting with disaster … His policies, especially ObamaCare, were never popular, but the accumulation of his failures has eroded his ability to defy political gravity. His taunting of Republicans and critics in campaign-style events reinforces doubts about his fitness. Absorbed with self-pity and fixated on finding blame, he gives the impression of someone who never considers the possibility he might be part of the problem. Let me be clear: Obama is flirting with disaster … His policies, especially ObamaCare, were never popular, but the accumulation of his failures has eroded his ability to defy political gravity. “So sue me,” he said at one point about GOP claims that he is exceeding lawful authority. “It’s not crazy. It’s not socialism. You know, it’s not, you know, the imperial presidency.” House Speaker John Boehner, who does intend to sue Obama, had a telling response about why his caucus would not pass an immigration bill. “The American people and their elected officials don’t trust [Obama] to enforce the law,” he said. Supreme Court decisions voiding the president’s overreach are one example, and the crisis on the southern border is another. By trying to put pressure on Republicans, and to score votes among liberals, Obama selectively enforced only parts of the immigration law — and advertised his desire to exempt those who came here illegally as children. Word quickly spread in Latin and Central America that if young people got across, they wouldn’t be sent back. And so they came, by the tens of thousands. Where did they get that message if not from the president? While it’s clear Obama will not listen to the public, there is still an outside chance that senior members of his party can persuade him to change course. Their argument would be a simple one: This isn’t working, and if you continue, Republicans will take the Senate and might well impeach you. If that doesn’t scare him straight, nothing will.

A TikTok dance video of former President Barack Obama’s younger daughter, Sasha, has gone viral across social media platforms. The 15-second video, set to artist Popp Hunna’s 2020 track “Adderall (Corvette Corvette),” shows Sasha in front of about seven people, all unmasked and inside what appears to be a kitchen. The group performs a relatively rehearsed-looking dance in the video, which begins with Sasha and her pals singing the word “b–ch.” The TikTok video was posted by one of the dancers in the clip, not Sasha, and the original post has since been taken down. “Sasha Obama doing the lord’s work teaching white kids rhythm,” one viral tweet says of the clip. “Sasha Obama about to make this girl’s TikTok viral,” another viewer reacted.

If she thinks something’s wrong or right, she will say so.” He then recalled an incident when the family was visiting Russia when Sasha was a child and she refused to taste caviar. “She was like, ‘Mnn-nnh.

        "articles": "Submit Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The controversial directive for New York nursing homes to admit COVID-19 patients increased the death toll among residents — and Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s claims otherwise have been disproven, according to a New York State Bar Association report exclusively obtained by The Post. The 242-page report by the NYSBA’s Task Force on Nursing Homes and Long-Term Care also blasts Cuomo for not reversing the Department of Health’s “unreasonable” mandate sooner than he did, saying it remained in effect weeks longer than necessary. “Although a determination of the number of additional nursing home deaths is beyond the capacity of the Task Force, there are credible reviews that suggest that the directive, for the approximately six weeks that it was in effect, did lead to some number of additional deaths,” the report says. “The Department of Health issued a report in 2020 in which it argued unconvincingly that the admission of 6,326 COVID-positive residents during the period the Health directive was in effect had no impact. That cannot be the case, and has now been shown not to be the case.” The report says it is based on available information “from the onset of the pandemic through the end of April 2021.” Its findings rely in part on a study by the Empire Center for Public Policy, first reported by The Post, that tied “several hundred and possibly more than 1,000” deaths of nursing home residents to the DOH’s March 25, 2020, order. The NYSBA report calls the “now infamous” directive “central to the public narrative of New York’s first surge experience,” noting that it “drew almost immediate criticism, caused the Governor to lash out at nursing homes, spurred a congressional inquiry, and, ultimately, an investigation of the Governor himself.” The last point appears to refer to an ongoing probe by the FBI and the Brooklyn US Attorney’s Office, but Cuomo’s handling of nursing homes is also part of an impeachment investigation by the Assembly Judiciary Committee, which is also focusing on sexual harassment allegations and other matters involving the three-term Democrat. The report was prepared by a 16-member task force co-chaired by Hermes Fernandez, a lawyer and lobbyist who formerly served as assistant counsel to Cuomo’s late father, then-Gov. Mario Cuomo. It was adopted by the NYSBA’s House of Delegates on Saturday, during meeting at which 93 percent of about 200 members present voted in favor, Fernandez said. The report faults the “absoluteness” of the DOH directive, which required nursing homes to admit “medically stable” COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals, and says it “was commonly read” as overriding a regulation for the facilities to only accept patients for whom they could properly care. “The directive came at a time when regulations were routinely being overridden,” the report says. “Providers were told to follow the Department of Health’s instructions.” The report also says that “it was unreasonable to leave the directive in place for so long” before Cuomo finally gave in to public pressure and reversed it on May 10, 2020. “Hospitalizations peaked on April 14th. The hospital beds at the Javits Center were barely used, and the USNS Comfort sat empty in the Hudson River,” the report says. “The Comfort set sail from New York City on April 23rd. The March 25th directive could have been rescinded on or about the date the Comfort set sail, if not sooner.” Tracy Alvino, whose father died after contracting the coronavirus while in a Long Island nursing home following neck surgery, said the NYSBA report “confirms what us families already knew.” “Cuomo lit the match and the nursing homes were the kerosene. It was a failure at every level. The nursing homes were unable to protect nursing home patients after accepting COVID patients,” Alvino said. “If the March 25 order wasn’t issued, countless lives would have been saved. These were preventable deaths.” In addition, the report notes that when the controversy over the directive erupted, the DOH “also ordered that nursing homes secure and maintain a sixty day supply of [personal protective equipment].” “No one would argue with the need for nursing homes to maintain adequate levels of PPE, but this was an order to stockpile PPE at the moment of highest cost and least supply,” the report says. “The order did nothing for patient care at the time, but did increase nursing home costs.” Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Queens) said Tuesday that he suspected the NYSBA report would be “the beginning of many other reports that will come to prove the deadly impact of the March 25 order.” “The window of being truthful and asking for forgiveness is gone,” said Kim, whose uncle died in a Queens nursing home after suffering symptoms of COVID-19. “I think there was a small window early on where they could have admitted their mistake and asked for forgiveness but now they have tripled down on their lies amid cover-ups, where if they admit the truth, they admit to acting criminally.” Haydee Paybee, whose mom died of COVID-19 in a Manhattan nursing home, said, “It’s great that the Bar Association highlighted the March 25 order.” “Why would you place COVID patients with the most vulnerable people in nursing homes? It’s insane,” Paybee said. “Cuomo is trying to let time pass so the issue goes away. The families will not make this issue go away.” A DOH spokesperson said of the report: “Sadly, this is yet another example of some politicians pushing their political agendas and personal vendettas.” “This latest report, like others before it, supports what we’ve said all along, that New York was blind-sided and got hit the hardest, that when COVID got into communities it quickly and quietly spread from asymptomatic staff into nursing homes, and that New York’s nursing home experience was not unlike that of other states,” the spokesperson said. “The report goes on to say New York’s proportion of nursing home deaths to total deaths ‘varied little from the rest of the nation’ and that ‘New York’s nursing homes are no better and no worse than the nation at large.’” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. An Obama-tied activist group training tens of thousands of agitators to protest President Trump’s policies plans to hit Republican lawmakers supporting those policies even harder this week, when they return home for the congressional recess and hold town hall meetings and other functions. Organizing for Action, a group founded by former President Barack Obama and featured prominently on his new post-presidency website, is distributing a training manual to anti-Trump activists that advises them to bully GOP lawmakers into backing off support for repealing ObamaCare, curbing immigration from high-risk Islamic nations and building a border wall. In a new Facebook post, OFA calls on activists to mobilize against Republicans from now until Feb. 26, when “representatives are going to be in their home districts.” The protesters disrupted town halls earlier this month, including one held in Utah by House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who was confronted by hundreds of angry demonstrators claiming to be his constituents. The manual, published with OFA partner “Indivisible,” advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms, and “grab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together.” Rather, spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican host’s positions. “This will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus.” It also urges them to ask “hostile” questions — while keeping “a firm hold on the mic” — and loudly boo the GOP politician if he isn’t “giving you real answers.” “Express your concern [to the event’s hosts] they are giving a platform to pro-Trump authoritarianism, racism, and corruption,” it says. The goal is to make Republicans, even from safe districts, second-guess their support for the Trump agenda, and to prime “the ground for the 2018 midterms when Democrats retake power.” The goal is to make Republicans, even from safe districts, second-guess their support for the Trump agenda. “Even the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition,” the document states, “because these actions create the impression that they’re not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents.” After the event, protesters are advised to feed video footage to local and national media. “Unfavorable exchanges caught on video can be devastating” for Republican lawmakers, it says, when “shared through social media and picked up by local and national media.” After protesters gave MSNBC, CNN and the networks footage of their dust-up with Chaffetz, for example, the outlets ran them continuously, forcing Chaffetz to issue statements defending himself. The manual also advises protesters to flood “Trump-friendly” lawmakers’ Hill offices with angry phone calls and emails demanding the resignation of top White House adviser Steve Bannon. A script advises callers to complain: “I’m honestly scared that a known racist and anti-Semite will be working just feet from the Oval Office … It is everyone’s business if a man who promoted white supremacy is serving as an adviser to the president.” The document provides no evidence to support such accusations. Protesters, who may or may not be affiliated with OFA, are also storming district offices. Last week, GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher blamed a “mob” of anti-Trump activists for knocking unconscious a 71-year-old female staffer at his Southern California office. A video of the incident, showing a small crowd around an opening door, was less conclusive. Separately, OFA, which is run by ex-Obama officials and staffers, plans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCare’s repeal. “This is a fight we can win,” OFA recently told its foot soldiers. “They’re starting to waver.” On Thursday, Trump insisted he’s moving ahead with plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which has ballooned health insurance premiums and deductibles. “ObamaCare is a disaster, folks,” he said, adding that activists protesting its repeal are hijacking GOP town halls and other events. “They fill up our rallies with people that you wonder how they get there,” the president said. “But they’re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.” As The Post reported, OFA boasts more than 250 offices nationwide and more than 32,000 organizers, with another 25,000 actively under training. Since November, it’s beefed up staff and fundraising, though as a “social welfare” nonprofit, it does not have to reveal its donors. These aren’t typical Black Lives Matter or Occupy Wall Street marchers, but rather professionally trained organizers who go through a six-week training program similar to the training — steeped in Alinsky agitation tactics — Obama received in Chicago when he was a community organizer. Chicago socialist Saul Alinsky, known by the left as “the father of community organizing,” taught radicals to “rub raw the sores of discontent” and create the conditions for a “revolution.” He dedicated his book, “Rules for Radicals,” to “Lucifer.” Michelle Obama quoted from the book when she helped launch OFA in 2013. Obama appears to be behind the anti-Trump protests. He praised recent demonstrations against Trump’s travel ban. And last year, after Trump’s upset victory, he personally rallied OFA troops to “protect” his legacy in a conference call. “Now is the time for some organizing,” he said. “So don’t mope” over the election results. He promised OFA activists he would soon join them in the fray. “Understand that I’m going to be constrained in what I do with all of you until I am again a private citizen, but that’s not so far off,” he said. “You’re going to see me early next year, and we’re going to be in a position where we can start cooking up all kinds of great stuff.” Added the ex-president: “I promise you that next year Michelle and I are going to be right there with you, and the clouds are going to start parting, and we’re going to be busy. I’ve got all kinds of thoughts and ideas about it, but this isn’t the best time to share them. “Point is, I’m still fired up and ready to go, and I hope that all of you are, as well.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The Benghazi report released Tuesday makes clear that one dreadful constant of President Obama’s foreign policy is simply this: Deflect. Muddy the picture. Question the motivation. Blame the wrong culprit when naming the right culprit might interfere with your narrative, or if doing so might oblige you to act when you do not wish to act. In an addendum to the report, Reps. Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo detail the fact that the administration knew perfectly well in the immediate aftermath of the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi that it had been planned and directed by Islamist radicals as an evil commemoration of 9/11. For example, at 11:23 p.m. on the night of the attack, Hillary Clinton emailed her daughter, Chelsea, to say, “Two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an Al Quedalike [sic] group.” The next morning, she said, “We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault.” Sound familiar? Of course it does. After the attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando by home-grown terrorists, administration officials made a point of refusing to name the enemy publicly — in this case, ISIS, which had not yet come into existence at the time of Benghazi. On the day following Orlando, the president himself said we had yet to discern “the precise motivations of the killer,” even though everyone knew by that point he had called 911 to swear his allegiance to ISIS while he was killing people. Two weeks after the Orlando shooting — two weeks — Attorney General Loretta Lynch said, “I cannot tell you definitively that we will ever narrow it down to one motivation. We will look at all motivations.” With Benghazi, as with Orlando, the reason for these evasions is to make mystery and ambiguity a part of the narrative in order to buy the White House and the administration time and space — the time to control the story and the space to impress upon its supporters the impracticality and uselessness of responding to these acts of war. That’s why the first administration statement on the Benghazi attacks, made by Hillary Clinton, specifically made reference to the anti-Islamic video “Innocence of Muslims,” which had just created an international scandal — but did not make reference to the Islamic terrorists who perpetrated it. It came only an hour before Hillary emailed Chelsea and assigned blame to al Qaeda elements. At this point, a familiar face pops up in Section 2 of the Benghazi report, which lays out the administration’s actions in the wake of the attack. Yes, it’s none other than our buddy Ben Rhodes, the man who bragged to The New York Times Magazine about manipulating the press to adopt the administration’s line on the Iran deal. The report makes clear he was helping to design the administration’s response as he began the work of setting up the echo chamber in which the media would provide Obama exactly the time and space he wanted and needed. Rhodes did something odd in his testimony before the Benghazi committee. He claimed that the sentence about the anti-Islam video in the “Statement on the Attack on Benghazi” wasn’t really about Benghazi but was about “the region.” “It’s not intended to assign responsibility for what happened in Benghazi,” Rhodes testified. “It’s meant to describe the context of what happened, what’s happening in the region.” There had been protests in Cairo centering on the video that same day. His questioner responds incredulously: “So everything in this document is about Libya and Benghazi except you’re saying this sentence doesn’t apply to Libya and Benghazi?” Rhodes responds with gobbledygook about protecting Americans elsewhere. His strange claim here is telling, because it makes clear the administration seemed to want above all to mention the video in its first words on the attack to direct attention away from it or to include it in a larger list of troubles stemming from a reaction to “Innocence of Muslims.” All these misdirections and prevarications have taken their toll. An unambiguous response to a terrorist attack on an American facility in 2012 would have prevented the creation of the Benghazi committee in the first place. Due to the Benghazi committee’s efforts to secure the facts of the case, the world came to learn about Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of public email — an irresponsible and reckless act that more than anything else jeopardizes her presidential ambitions. But when it comes to radical Islam and the Obama administration, the truth is always the first casualty. Hillary is hoping her presidential bid isn’t its last. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Local authorities were warned two and a half months prior to the massacre in a Florida high school that accused shooter Nikolas Cruz had “used a gun against people before,” according to a disturbing new report. The chilling details on Cruz’s troubled past were revealed in 911 records obtained by CNN. Cruz, 19, began acting violent shortly after he and his younger brother, Zachary, moved into neighbor Rocxanne Deschamps’ trailer home following their mother’s death in November. Palm Beach County sheriff’s deputies were called to the trailer three times in less than a week — for a report of a weapon and a fight between Cruz and Deschamps’ 22-year-old son, Rock. The day before Thanksgiving, Rock called 911 to report that he believed Cruz, whom he described as an “adopted 19-year-old son,” had hidden a “gun in the back yard,” according to the 911 dispatcher’s notes. Rock told authorities “there were no weapons allowed in the household,” the report said. It’s unclear whether a search of the property in Lantana was conducted and the call was classified as “domestic unfounded.” Four days later, Cruz erupted into rage after losing a photo of his dead mom and began punching walls. He then started fighting with Rock — and left the home. Rocxanne called 911, telling the dispatcher that Cruz said “he was going to get his gun and come back” and that he’d “bought a gun from Dick’s last week and is now going to pick it up.” She also said Cruz had “bought tons of ammo” and “has used a gun against ppl before,” the notes said. “He has put the gun to others’ heads in the past,” Rocxanne added. When deputies responded, Cruz and Rock “hugged and reconcile[d] their differences.” Cruz also “said he was sorry for losing his temper.” Rocxanne declined to press charges, telling authorities she didn’t want Cruz going to jail because he’d been “going through a lot” after his mom’s death, according to WPTV. The day before the fight between Rock and Cruz, a social worker from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School asked deputies to check on Zachary Cruz, WPTV reported. The 17-year-old boy hadn’t shown up at school since his mother died, but he “was never disenrolled from school in Broward to attend any other school,” the social worker said. Deputies visited the trailer but were told to come back later. It’s unclear if they did. Rocxanne’s ex-fiance Paul Gold, a longtime neighbor of the Cruzes in Parkland, recalled how Nikolas Cruz was upset that no one showed up for his mom’s funeral, CNN reported. “The boy was stoic. Not a tear. Not an emotion,” said Gold, who drove Cruz to the funeral. “I asked him if he was upset. He said: ‘I’m upset because nobody came, and nobody cares about my mother.’” “I told him that his mother was loved by many, many people and they just couldn’t make it, timing and whatnot,” Cruz added. “It was a complete lie. But I felt horrible. Here’s this poor kid, and his mother dies, and not a soul shows up.” The only people who went were Cruz, his brother, Gold and Rocxanne. Gold said he wasn’t aware that Cruz had guns and called him a “monster.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Hillary Rodham Clinton lies. This is a widely acknowledged fact among people who pay attention and aren’t on her payroll. Nearly 20 years ago, New York Times columnist William Safire wrote: “Americans of all political persuasions are coming to the sad realization that our first lady — a woman of undoubted talents who was a role model for many in her generation — is a congenital liar.” Younger folks probably have little to no memory of the lies Safire had in mind, though some might have heard about Clinton’s infamously implausible explanation for how she managed to make a 10,000 percent profit in cattle futures simply by reading The Wall Street Journal. Suffice it to say that she’s been honing her craft for decades. And it’s turning into a problem for her. After ducking the press for months, Clinton sat down for an interview with CNN’s Brianna Keilar. It was a savvy choice. Keilar covers the Clinton campaign and has every incentive not to offend her famously vindictive sources 16 months before the election. The most discussed deception came in an exchange about her emails. Clinton declared emphatically, “You know, you’re starting with so many assumptions that are — I’ve never had a subpoena . . . Let’s take a deep breath here.” Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), chair of the committee investigating the Obama administration’s response to the Benghazi attack, promptly produced a copy of the subpoena. Team Clinton says she was responding to a specific allegation that she deleted emails that were under subpoena. It’s a legalistically plausible defense given Keilar’s muddled question and Stakhanovite effort to avoid asking meaningful follow-ups. Still, it was a classically Clintonian way of lying: Make a sweeping, definitive-sounding statement, and then when called on it, release a fog of technicalities. Of course, the greatest example of this tactic was her husband’s parsing of the word “is” when called out for saying things like “there is no improper relationship” with a White House intern. Only under oath did he explain it was technically true if you understand “is” to be a statement about the present moment, unlike “was.” The rest of the CNN interview was a farrago of misleading statements, blame-shifting and deceptions. Hillary insisted she’d only used “one device” for email, when we now know that’s not true. Perhaps under oath she would clarify that she meant “one device at a time.” She proclaimed that she broke no rules by using a personal server and other email chicanery. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker column gave her “three Pinocchios” (out of a possible four) on those claims. Clinton even flatly denied that voters distrust her when polls clearly show Americans do, and — as usual — blamed all her problems on right-wing conspirators. Reacting to the interview, Carl Bernstein — of Woodward and Bernstein fame — offered an odd analysis of Clinton’s deceptions, conceding that Clinton has a “difficult relationship with the truth.” “We have to look at what politicians do generally in terms of fudging,” Bernstein added. “It’s endemic in the profession. She’s become a kind of specialist at it.” He went on to explain that Clinton had to become a specialist because she’s a victim of her husband’s peccadilloes — what Bernstein called the “peculiarity of the Clinton situation.” Because Bill catted around, “she’s been in a difficult position.” It was a strangely forgiving argument from a reporter who made his career by exposing presidential deceit. And while it’s certainly true Bill put Hillary in some awkward predicaments, his philandering doesn’t explain why she lied on issues ranging from her cattle-futures windfall to her stealth server. But Bernstein is right about one thing: Hillary is a specialist at lying. And that’s a problem for her. Her husband was — and is — a prodigy at deceit, a renaissance man of lying. If football were a game of lies, he could play every position on offense and defense. Mrs. Clinton, alas, is more like a veteran coach — she’s adept at telling others how to lie on her behalf. But she’s not a natural liar herself, and it shows. At a time when the Democratic base craves authenticity (hence the mobs at Bernie Sanders rallies), Clinton seems utterly fabricated (hence her inability to get a capacity crowd at her announcement speech last month in New York City). Her best hope now would be to stop pandering to Sanders’ fans and instead explain where she and Sanders differ on policy. But that would require a level of political authenticity she’s forgotten how to fake convincingly. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. WASHINGTON — Hillary Clinton was grilled during Wednesday night’s Democratic presidential debate about the prospect of facing criminal charges over ­her email scandal. “Would you drop out of the race if you were indicted?” moderator Jorge Ramos asked about the ongoing FBI investigation into classified material on a personal home server that Clinton used while she was secretary of state. Clinton dodged and repeated her oft-used response that she never used her home server to send or receive classified material. “It wasn’t the best choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed,” Clinton said at the Univision forum in Miami. Ramos pressed: “Who gave you permission? Was it President Obama?” “There was no permission to be asked. It had been done by my predecessors. It was permitted,” Clinton responded. “If you get indicted, would you drop out?” Ramos repeated. “Oh, for goodness — that’s not going to happen. I’m not even answering that question,” Clinton said. The face-off against Bernie Sanders came the day after he shocked Clinton in the Michigan primary, which the Vermont senator proudly called “one of the major political upsets in modern American history.” Ramos also pressed Clinton about the 2012 Benghazi attack, to boos from the audience. Clinton denied that she misled victims’ families about the Libya attack when she at first said it was triggered by an anti-Islam video. The moment was highlighted by a clip of grieving mom Patricia Smith accusing Clinton of lying to her about the circumstances of son Sean Smith’s death. “I certainly can’t even imagine the grief that she has for losing her son, but she’s wrong,” Clinton said. “She’s absolutely wrong.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. New York public-school students caught stealing, doing drugs or even attacking someone can avoid suspension under new “progressive” discipline rules adopted this month. Most likely, they will be sent to a talking circle instead, where they can discuss their feelings. Convinced traditional discipline is racist because blacks are suspended at higher rates than whites, New York City’s Department of Education has in all but the most serious and dangerous offenses replaced out-of-school suspensions with a touchy-feely alternative punishment called “restorative justice,” which isn’t really punishment at all. It’s therapy. “Every reasonable effort must be made to correct student behavior through…restorative practices,” advises the city’s new 32-page discipline code. Except everywhere it’s been tried, this softer approach has backfired. Yes, other large urban school districts are reporting fewer suspensions since adopting the non-punitive approach. But that doesn’t necessarily mean fewer infractions. In fact, many districts are seeing more classroom disruptions and violence — a national trend that ought to set off warning bells for New York school officials. What’s more, the movement — which is driven by new race-based anti-discipline guidelines issued by the Obama administration — is creating friction between teachers unions and the liberal mayors they otherwise support. Politicians can praise the new system, but it’s teachers who must deal with the disruptive and sometimes violent results. Last month, for instance, the Chicago Teachers Union complained the city’s revised student-discipline code has left teachers struggling to control unruly kids. “It’s just basically been a totally lawless few months,” one teacher told the Chicago Tribune. In June, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced that the district, as part of a “Suspension and Expulsion Reduction Plan,” was “moving away from a zero-tolerance policy and promoting restorative practices.” Students who bully classmates can no longer be removed from classrooms except for the worst offenses, and only then with the consent of a district supervisor. Just as Mayor de Blasio promised last month in announcing New York’s revised discipline policy, Emanuel assured skeptics the more “holistic” approach — which he says addresses the “root causes” of bad behavior — would still provide “a safe learning environment.” But so far this school year, the Tribune reports students have suffered little consequence for infractions as serious as groping a teacher and bringing hollow-point bullets to class. “You have to have consequences,” Chicago fifth-grade teacher John Engels told the paper. “If you knew the cops weren’t going to enforce the speed limit…you’d go 100 miles an hour.” In Syracuse, meanwhile, teachers complain student behavior has worsened since the school district collapsed discipline structures in favor of restorative justice practices. They say teens are more apt to fight, mouth off to teachers and roam the halls under the more lenient policy. They’re even seeing increasingly violent behavior among elementary school children. While the approach may be “laudable,” Syracuse Teachers Association President Kevin Ahern said in a recent letter to the Syracuse Post-Standard, it has created a “systemic inability to administer and enforce consistent consequences for violent and highly disruptive student behaviors” that “put students and staff at risk and make quality instruction impossible.” Los Angeles Unified School District is seeing a similar spike in campus offenses after its school superintendent followed federal orders to reduce suspensions of African-Americans. Even threats against teachers are ignored, as administrators’ hands are tied by the new policy. “I was terrified and bullied by a fourth-grade student,” a teacher at a Los Angeles Unified School District school recently noted on the Los Angeles Times website. “The black student told me to ‘Back off, b—h.’ I told him to go to the office and he said, ‘No, b—h, and no one can make me.’ ” I’m going to torture you. I’m doing this because I can’t be removed. Complained another LAUSD teacher: “We now have a ‘restorative justice’ counselor, but we still have the same problems. Kids aren’t even suspended for fights or drugs.” In neighboring Orange County, teachers are dealing with increasingly violent and disrespectful student behavior since schools there also switched to the restorative strategy. Recently mandated “positive interventions” have only exacerbated discipline problems in the largely minority Santa Ana public school district, where middle-school kids now regularly smoke pot in bathrooms — some even in class — and attack staff — spitting on teachers, pelting them with eggs, even threatening to stab them, according to the Orange County Register. According to a recent teachers union survey, 65 percent of Santa Ana educators said the softer discipline system is not working. Dozens of teachers have filed hostile-work-environment complaints. Defiance toward teachers is on the rise in Philadelphia public schools, as well, where talking circles have replaced suspensions. A former Philly middle-school teacher complains minority students act out and then dare teachers to kick them out of class, knowing full well their hands are now tied. “I’m going to torture you,” Allen Zollman says one student told him. “I’m doing this because I can’t be removed.” Knowing there won’t be consequences, bullies control the classroom and disrupt lessons for all kids who want to learn. “The less we are willing or able to respond, the more they will control the classroom, the hallways and the school,” Zollman added in testimony before the US Commission on Civil Rights. The administration welcomes this “Lord of the Flies” scenario. Thanks to talking circles and peer juries, “young people are now taking control of the environment,” Education Secretary Arne Duncan gushed in a 2014 speech to black students at Howard University. “It’s sort of a counterintuitive thing for many of us as adults, but the more we give up power, the more we empower others, often the better things are,” Duncan added. “And empowering teenagers to be part of the solution, having them control the [classroom] environment, control the culture, be the leaders, listening to them, respecting them — when we do that, wonderful things happen for kids in communities that didn’t happen historically.” Just weeks after “empowering teenagers,” San Diego public schools witnessed a surge in violent assaults. At Lincoln High School, for example, students reported frequent campus fighting. In just one recent month, there were several arrests, including one involving a butcher knife, according to local TV news reports. School officials confirm at least 16 batteries in just the first few months of the school year. Violence is still a problem in Oakland schools after officials there substituted such restorative counseling for suspensions on similar orders from Obama educrats. “There have been serious threats against teachers,” Oakland High School science teacher Nancy Caruso told the Christian Science Monitor, and yet the students weren’t expelled. She notes a student who set another student’s hair on fire received a “restorative” talk in lieu of suspension. Yet the administration is holding up Oakland’s new discipline program as a national model. Little wonder: Teacher training for the program, led by Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth, includes sessions titled, “Race and Restorative Justice” and “African-Centered Restorative Justice Approaches.” After spending millions on restorative justice and “courageous conversations about race” training, Portland public schools have seen their students only grow more violent. After a black high-school boy repeatedly punched his teacher in the face, sending her to the emergency room, the teacher, who is white, was advised by the assistant principal not to press charges. The administrator lectured her about how hard it is for young black men to overcome a criminal record. Worse, she was told she should examine what role she, “as a white woman” holding unconscious racial biases, played in the attack, according to the Willamette (Oregon) Week. A white sixth-grade teacher at a mostly black Washington, DC, school told the US Commission on Civil Rights she had similar “conversations” in which she was told that the bad behavior of black boys is mainly the teacher’s fault. “I have been encouraged to examine and question how my own racial dispositions affect my teaching and my students,” Andrea Smith testified. During cultural sensitivity training required of school districts under restorative justice programs, teachers are told they are largely to blame for bad behavior of black students because they “misinterpret” African-American culture. The training sessions, which often run several days, are led by civil-rights activist groups seeking “racial justice.” One prominent consulting group is Pacific Educational Group. San Francisco-based PEG has collected millions of dollars from dozens of major school districts across the country holding teacher workshops designed to “achieve racial justice in our schools.” Among PEG’s workshops: “De-centering Whiteness in School Discipline” and “White Supremacy, White Privilege and Racial Oppression: Getting In On Courageous Conversation.” Here’s the course description of a 2013 restorative justice-related workshop, according to a PEG brochure: “Institutions are infested with token people of color and racist white people who uphold White Supremacy, causing a survivor mentality among those who encounter daily micro-invalidations, -aggressions, and -assaults in hostile environments. Though a historical overview, learn about the oppressive system known as the American Education System, a school system that was never designed for children of color.” At least two top Obama education officials have received PEG awards at national PEG conferences. White teachers are taught to check their “unconscious racial bias” when dealing with black students who act out. They’re told to open their eyes to “white privilege” and white cultural “dominance,” and have more empathy for black kids who may be lashing out in frustration. They are trained to identify “root causes” of black anger, such as America’s legacy of racism. Teachers are told to respect black “culture,” which is described as more “emotional” and “physical,” and to give disruptive students a pass when they curse and threaten them, because “African-American boys are demonstrative” and that’s just how they “engage in learning,” according to the Monitor. Talk about racism! Instead of being kicked out of school or suffering other serious punishment, even repeat offenders can negotiate the consequences for their bad behavior, which usually involve paper-writing and “dialogue sessions.” RJ (restorative justice) can encourage misbehavior by lavishing attention on students for committing infractions. Teachers are trained to make sure black kids “feel respected,” and to listen to their complaints without judgment or criticism. Misbehaving kids are handed a “talking stick” and encouraged to emote about the issues underlying their anger. More often than not, they are treated as victims, even if they start fights or threaten teachers. No longer can teachers in these programs deal swiftly with a disruptive child by removing him from class. Conflicts take days, even weeks to resolve as schools coordinate talking circles around the schedules of teachers, principals, counselors, parents and even campus police — all of whom must take time out and meet to deal ever-so-delicately with a single problem student. And that doesn’t include the in-class circles also required under the restorative approach. Teachers are trained never to snap at a mouthy student interrupting a lesson but rather to gather students in a circle to share their feelings about the problem. Even if such pow-wows diffuse conflicts, they take an inordinate amount of time away from academic instruction. They also give troublemakers incentive to continue causing trouble. “RJ (restorative justice) can encourage misbehavior by lavishing attention on students for committing infractions,” warns Paul Bruno, who participated in talking circles while teaching middle school in Oakland and South Central Los Angeles. In fact, he added in a Scholastic.com blog, “the circles may unwittingly allow already assertive students to leverage their social dominance even further inside the classroom.” Restorative justice activists argue the program combats bias that contributes to disproportionate discipline, suspensions, drop-outs and the “school-to-prison pipeline.” But all too often, it merely provides rowdy students an excuse for continued bad behavior. New York public schools may get their suspension numbers “right” under the new racially correct discipline standards. But their enrollment numbers will likely suffer in the process, as more students — and teachers — transfer to safer private or charter schools. In a misguided effort to be “fair” to a few, politicians are hurting the education of the many.

Con Ed has given the Ground Zero mosque an ultimatum: Pay the $1.7 million you owe in back rent, or we’ll terminate your lease and take back our property. Con Ed and mosque developer Park51 have an unusual, uneasy alliance, sharing ownership of a site slated to be one of the most controversial projects in city history. The utility owns a former substation on the western half of the property, at 51 Park Place, and the mosque developers own a five-story building on the eastern half. The buildings were connected years ago and used to house a Burlington Coat Factory store. Park51, which leases the substation from Con Ed, wants the two buildings so it can knock both down and build a $100 million, 15-story community center. But the plan hit a major obstacle in August when Con Ed raised the rent from $2,750 a month, a rate set in 1972, to $47,437 a month, retroactive to July 31, 2008, The Post has learned. GROUND ZERO MOSQUE DOESN’T HAVE A PAYER When the mosque failed to fork over the $1.7 million, the utility fired off a letter demanding the money by Oct. 4 and threatening to evict. Park51 principals responded with a lawsuit to stop the increase, calling Con Ed’s rent demands “outrageous.” “Whether it is bowing to political pressure or seeking to retain the valuable premises for itself, Con Ed appears intent on proceeding with its wrongful termination,” argued Sharif El-Gamal, the lead Park51 developer. Gamal said Con Ed’s move also wipes out his ability to eventually buy the substation building, where the Park51 developers have converted the first floor into a prayer space. They turned the first floor of the adjoining building into a cultural center and recently debuted their first event, a photography exhibit. The modest space is in sharp contrast to the expansive plans unveiled last year that generated worldwide controversy for their proximity to Ground Zero. Gamal’s group bought the building at 45-47 Park Place in 2009 for $4.8 million and, at the same time, paid $700,000 for the lease at the substation. The deal was considered a bargain as the entire property had been on the market for $18 million only a few years earlier. The lease with Con Ed included an option to buy, which Gamal said in 2010 that he wanted to pursue. If he doesn’t own the Con Ed property, he would have to get any demolition approved by the utility. After conflicting appraisals of the property by Gamal and Con Ed, it seems both sides came to an agreement this summer. Court papers show that the appraised price for the Con Ed property is $10.7 million. But Gamal contends Con Ed’s math was faulty when it calculated the rent, saying it owes only $881,519 in back rent and should have to pay $25,875 a month going forward. Gamal got a court order to temporarily prevent Con Ed from ending his lease. A hearing is set for Nov. 17. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. About half of New York Times employees said in a recent internal survey that they don’t believe they can speak freely at the paper. In response to the statement, “There is a free exchange of views in this company; people are not afraid to say what they really think,” only 51% of Times employees responded in the affirmative. In company comments that accompanied the December poll’s findings, which were viewed by The Post, the 51 percent was noted as being 10% lower than the “benchmark.” One insider said the benchmark likely refers to the average among similar companies surveyed on that statement. “Although the majority of us feel well-informed, many indicated that differing viewpoints aren’t sought or valued in our work,” read the Times’ internal assessment of the data. “Relatedly, we saw some negative responses on whether there’s a free exchange of views in the company, and scored below the benchmark on this question.” A total of 74% of Times staffers said leaders and colleagues accept and embrace differences in ethnicity/race — a 10% decline from the results of the same inquiry in 2019. “We saw steep declines in answers about leaders and colleagues accepting and embracing differences in race, gender, identity and religion. Responses from Black and Latino colleagues declined at an even greater rate,” the paper fretted. The survey results were revealed to The Post as the former paper of record is embroiled in a seemingly endless parade of scandals. Most recently, a decision to oust veteran science reporter Donald McNeil over his non-derogatory use of a racial slur during a Times-sponsored trip with students has divided the newsroom. A column from their in-house conservative columnist Bret Stephens criticizing the McNeil dismissal was personally spiked by publisher A.G. Sulzberger. The piece was later published in the New York Post. In June, The New York Times suffered another woke revolt after the paper’s opinion section published an op-ed from Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton urging that federal soldiers be sent to US cities to quell antifa and BLM violence during the summer. Dozens of employees publicly protested the piece’s publication, saying it put “Black @nytimes staff in danger.” The fallout led to the resignation of Op-Ed editor James Bennet. Other leading opinion staffers, including Bari Weiss, left in the months after Bennet’s departure. The Times did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Post. “There is a group of younger reporters and a fair number of tech people and people on the audio side who do not come out of the tradition of journalism at the Times. … They see their role as to be more active,” Alex Berenson, a former NYT business reporter, told The Post. “There’s a lot of anguish among older people” about younger, woke staff, he added.

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations against Brett Kavanaugh are serious. She is accusing him of violent attempted rape. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me. He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing,” she told The Washington Post, recounting the alleged incident at a high school party “one summer in the early 1980s.” But her story is also growing less believable by the day. Here are eight reasons why it’s hardly “anti-woman” for senators to question her account at Thursday’s hearing: 1) For starters, Ford still can’t recall basic details of what she says was the most traumatic event in her life. Not where the “assault” took place — she’s not sure whose house it was, or even what street it was on. Nor when — she’s not even sure of the year, let alone the day and month. Ford’s not certain how old she was or what grade she was in when she says an older student violently molested her. (But she doesn’t plead inebriation: She described having just “one beer” at the party.) 2) Ford concedes she told no one what happened to her at the time, not even her best friend or mother. That means she can rely on no contemporaneous witness to corroborate her story. 3) Worse, the four other people she identified as attending the party, including Kavanaugh, all deny knowledge of the gathering in question, including Leland Ingham Keyser, who she calls a “lifelong friend.” Keyser’s lawyer told the Senate Judiciary Committee: “Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with or without Dr. Ford.” The other two potential witnesses — Mark Judge and Patrick “P.J.” Smyth — also deny any recollection of attending such a party. The committee took their sworn statements “under penalty of perjury.” “These witnesses directly contradict Professor Ford’s allegations against Judge Kavanaugh,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley advised Ford’s attorneys last week. In her original letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Ford claimed that Kavanaugh talked to Keyser and Smyth right after he assaulted her. Yet neither shares her memory. This is, to say the least, highly problematic for her case. No witness corroborates any part of her story. 4) Her own immediate family doesn’t appear to be backing her up, either. Her mother, father and two siblings are all conspicuously absent from a letter of support released by a dozen relatives, mostly on her husband’s side of the family. The letter attests to her honesty and integrity. “Why didn’t her parents and brothers sign the letter?” a congressional source familiar with the investigation wondered. 5) This summer, Ford tried to reach out to old friends from high school and college to jog her memory. They couldn’t help her. “I’ve been trying to forget this all my life, and now I’m supposed to remember every little detail,” Ford complained to one friend in July, according to an account in The San Jose Mercury News. 6) Yet she still pushed forward with her bombshell charge, contacting The Washington Post tip line and Democratic lawmakers, while hiring a Democratic activist lawyer. Ford is also a Democrat, as well as an anti-Trump marcher, raising questions about the motive and timing of the allegations along with their veracity. 7) Ford contends that notes her therapist took in 2012 corroborate her account. But they don’t mention Kavanaugh. They also point up inconsistencies in her story. For instance, her shrink noted that Ford told her there were “four boys” in the bedroom, not two as she now says. The notes also indicate Ford said she was in her “late teens” when she was assaulted. But Ford now says she may have been only 15. 8) In another inconsistency, Ford told The Washington Post she was upset when Trump won in 2016, because Kavanaugh was mentioned as a Supreme Court pick. But Kavanaugh wasn’t added to Trump’s list of possibles until November 2017, a full year later. On top of all that, Kavanaugh “unequivocally denied Dr. Ford’s allegations . . . under penalty of perjury” during a Sept. 17 interview with committee lawyers, Grassley said, adding he was “forthright and emphatic in his testimony” and “fully answered all questions.” The sworn interview will no doubt be used to test the consistency and veracity of his public statements Thursday. Yet Democrats have already tried and convicted Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Without hard evidence, without substantiation, some even go beyond Ford’s claims to call him an out-and-out “rapist,” “sexual predator,” even a “child predator.” As a result, Kavanaugh and his family, “including his two young daughters, have faced serious death threats and vicious assaults,” Grassley said. “And they’re getting worse each day.” Ford, who also has received threats, is by all accounts a respected scientific researcher in the field of psychology with an impressive pedigree. While that makes her credible, the same can’t be said for her story. Unless she can fill in the many holes, Kavanaugh still deserves the presumption of innocence. Paul Sperry is a bestselling author.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley, is home to eBay, PayPal and Cisco. Yet despite its enormous wealth, a San Jose house right across from a fire station burned down in 2013 because the station lacked fire trucks. This year, police staffing is down in San Jose. Its roads are pocked with potholes. And again, fire engines are mothballed. How is all this possible? The answer is that nearly 25 percent of San Jose’s budget pays for generous pensions — called “defined-benefit” plans — that guarantee retired city workers as much as 90 percent of their former salaries for life. That has left too little for core city services like policing and firefighting. California’s experience offers vital lessons for New York. In San Jose, pension costs exploded from $62 million in 2003 to nearly $210 million in 2013. So even though the San Jose Police Department budget skyrocketed nearly 50 percent during the past decade, police staffing fell 20 percent — because so much of the money was eaten up by the pensions. Marin County, north of San Francisco, is also battling exploding pension costs. Home to “Star Wars” creator George Lucas, Marin is the wealthiest county in California. But its public-school teachers are members of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a defined-benefit pension system that’s $104 billion in debt. To fill this gaping hole, the California legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown jacked up the amount school districts must pay to the CalSTRS fund each year by a whopping 132 percent. Marin will see its outlays soar to $36 million in 2020, from just $15 million in 2014. “I have no idea where we’re supposed to get the money,” one exasperated school official in Marin County says. Pouring additional millions into pensions leaves school districts with less money to hire new teachers, repair school buildings and provide for the classroom needs of children. Pension payments to CalSTRS from all California school districts will increase to $6.4 billion in 2021, from $2.3 billion in 2015 — a nearly threefold increase. These higher costs will drain school budgets for more than 30 years. Yet, shockingly, CalSTRS CEO Jack Ehnes wants to hike teachers’ pension benefits by another 50 percent. California’s experience offers important lessons. First, wealthy communities nationwide are not immune to deep cuts in basic public services when the pension “hogzilla” attacks. The history of government pension plans is one of politicians overpromising benefits, underpaying pension funds and pushing mountains of debt onto future generations. Schools and communities are stuck bailing out the mismanaged plans, usually by squeezing services. Second, with politicians and bureaucrats sacrificing education and public safety to prop up failed pension systems, they’ve passed the moral tipping point. Former San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed explains the unfairness: “I am cutting services to my low- and moderate-income people . . . to pay really generous benefits for public employees.” This is clearly immoral. Yet the same story may soon unfold in New York. Here, state and local governments have promised $308 billion more in pension benefits than what’s in their pension funds. That’s a $15,000 debt for every New Yorker. California’s pension debt is nearly $20,000 per resident. To make ends meet, more and more communities may have to roll back core services. Fortunately, there’s a solution. California, New York, New Jersey and other states can switch to 401(k)-style pensions for teachers, police officers and other public employees. These are the kinds of plans that are most common today in the private sector. Mr. Reed is advancing a 2016 statewide ballot measure in California to begin this switch. With 401(k)s, government employees own and invest their own pension money. As with private-sector pension plans, employees are guaranteed fixed payments from their employers — but not specific benefits at retirement. So taxpayers can never be on the hook for funding gaps, because 401(k)s are always fully funded. Also, with 401(k)s, government pension costs are easier to project and control. Benefits can be adjusted based on economic and market realities. The savings from switching to 401(k)s would allow current pension debts to be paid off quickly. For California, New York, New Jersey and elsewhere, it’s a vital step toward sparing future generations the pension pain too many schools and communities are feeling today. Lawrence J.

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. So, will Chris Cuomo, CNN’s most favored blowhard, report Thursday night on the bombshell findings into his brother’s long-term sexual predation? My educated guess: No. Why would he? He didn’t Tuesday or Wednesday, he won’t Thursday, and he never will, no matter how his brother goes down. Cuomo the Younger is but one example of privileged, liberal men, high on their own self-regard, who have really outdone themselves this week. Let’s look at our disgraced governor Andrew. The deluge of credible accusations leveled against him months ago — truly despicable stuff — wasn’t enough to shame him from office. (Nor were the nursing home deaths he covered up, but that’s another story.) No, this self-styled feminist doubled down, seeming to out one of his own family members in telling the attorney general’s independent investigators that he only kept asking one young staffer about her sexual assault because a very close family member had been sexually assaulted in high school and this had made him extra-sensitive. A new low, even for him. There is no longer any debate as to what Gov. Cuomo did, how he abused his power, and what he truly thinks of women. If #MeToo is to mean anything, Andrew Cuomo must go. So too must Chris be ousted from his perch at CNN. As we now know, Chris secretly advised his brother to gut out this scandal, over a series of crisis talks, despite a pronounced conflict of interest. Not only that — the AG report reveals that Chris was also given secret and privileged information from the Executive Branch during the crisis, helped draft at least one of his brother’s denials, and made decisions that impacted employees of the State. These are serious breaches of journalistic ethics. I know, I know: Chris isn’t really a journalist. He just plays one on TV. But still — how can CNN expect to be taken seriously with this guy still on the air? Remember, it was Chris who told his audience, with his usual soupçon of smugness, that he couldn’t cover the governor’s scandal because they were brothers. This, despite Chris hosting his brother near-nightly at the height of the pandemic. If logic has no place in Chris Cuomo’s ethical code, how can he be trusted to deliver the news? And let’s not forget Chris faking his re-entry from the basement, where he’d been isolating with COVID, even though he’d been breaking quarantine all over the Hamptons like the entitled, virtue-signaling hypocrite he is. But this was Tuesday, and the news cycle can give you whiplash. Perhaps the Cuomos were hoping reports of President Obama’s massive, 500-guest birthday blowout at his $12 million Martha’s Vineyard estate this weekend, with 200 servers on hand, might become the next focus of public outrage. After all, as “one set of rules for me, another for thee” goes, this was pretty egregious stuff. But Obama, in an unusual show of humility, reconsidered. He’s reportedly scaling way down. Perhaps this howl from a local worker resonated: “His birthday party is insane,” one of Obama’s caterers told The Post on Monday. “His bash is a nightmare to pull off this time of year on the tiny island — especially due to the lack of labor due to the coronavirus. What is he thinking?” Obama was probably thinking that super-spreader events are only for Trumpers — and that he, of course, was doing it right. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned about Obama in his brief time since leaving office, it’s that he cares more about wealth, celebrity and Netflix deals than lending his halo effect to any substantial, non-profit-making post-presidential work. Alas. And this brings us to Matt Damon, last week the subject of glowing profiles as the savior of movies for grown-ups. So confident is Damon in his greatness that he told the UK Sunday Times that, up until a few months ago, he often tossed around what he called “the f-word for homosexual” until his daughter told him it was wrong. Matt Damon, 50 years old, raging liberal and self-identified intellectual — one who preaches to us all on climate change while flying private, or the importance of public schools while sending his kids to private ones — expects us to believe that he didn’t know the meaning and weight of this word? It gets even better. After massive backlash online — Damon’s new movie, in which he plays an American oil rigger in MAGA drag, already a bomb — he issued a statement claiming that he never, ever, ever used the f-slur. Ever. Here’s the thing: If Matt Damon had never said that word or told that story, if the UK Sunday Times got it wrong or made it up, Matt Damon would be suing that paper for millions in libel damages — and not for nothing, libel laws in the UK are harder on the press than they are here. If Damon had a case, you’d better believe he’d make it. But he’s not. Instead, Damon is running to Variety — and after reading this fantasy version of events, you have to wonder why any publication would dare give it their imprimatur. “During a recent interview, I recalled a discussion I had with my daughter where I attempted to contextualize for her the progress that has been made — though by no means completed — since I was growing up in Boston and, as a child, heard the word ‘f-g’ used on the street before I knew what it even referred to,” Damon said in part. “I have never called anyone f—-t in my personal life and this conversation with my daughter was not a personal awakening.” If you believe that, Chris Cuomo has a story tonight he’d rather not tell you.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the indictment against an ex-Kentucky cop for shooting into the apartment next to Breonna Taylor’s, saying the call for equal justice was “not answered.” The former vice president said Taylor, who was killed in a botched police drug raid in March, was “shot in her own home by the police.” “In the wake of her tragic death, we mourn with her mother, family, and community and ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America,” Biden said in a statement. “I know for so many people, today’s decision does not answer that call.” Biden’s statement issued late Wednesday was in response to a grand jury’s decision not to indict for murder the Louisville officers involved in Taylor’s shooting. One officer, Brett Hankison, was indicted on a charge of wanton endangerment for firing shots into the apartment adjoining Taylor’s. The announcement led to protests in Louisville and other cities across the country, including New York. Two police officers in Louisville were shot during the demonstrations Wednesday evening and are recovering after suffering non-life-threatening injuries. In his statement, Biden noted that a federal investigation into the shooting is continuing, but called for measures to be taken immediately. “We do not need to wait for the final judgment of that investigation to do more to deliver justice for Breonna. We know what is necessary,” he said. “We need to start by addressing the use of excessive force, banning chokeholds, and overhauling no-knock warrants,” he continued. Biden also condemned violent backlash, saying he understands that people are “frustrated and they have a right to peacefully protest, but violence is never acceptable.” He and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, echoed the rallying cries of Taylor’s supporters, saying “we must continue to speak Breonna Taylor’s name.” “We must never stop speaking Breonna’s name as we work to reform our justice system, including overhauling no-knock warrants,” Harris said in a Twitter post. President Trump also addressed the protests, calling for “law and order” and offering prayers for the two police officers who were shot. “Praying for the two police officers that were shot tonight in Louisville, Kentucky,” he tweeted. “The Federal Government stands behind you and is ready to help.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The feds report that New York’s public schools are awash in cash, a conclusion impossible to dispute. Now the question becomes this: When it comes to education spending, how much is enough? Here’s one answer: Anything short of all the money in the world will never be enough to satisfy New York’s parasitical public-education cartel. And never mind, say, the city’s corroding mass-transit system. Here’s the latest news, courtesy of the US Census Bureau and the Empire Center for Public Policy’s E.J. McMahon: Per-pupil public-school spending in 2014-15 exceeded the national average by a breathtaking 86 percent. And total school spending ($64.8 billion) was greater than the entire current state budgets of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined ($59.5 billion). More to the point, says the Empire Center, “School spending in New York [state] was driven primarily by instructional salaries and benefits — which, at $14,769 per pupil, were 114 percent above the national average of $6,903, the census data show.” Translation: New York’s teachers are the nation’s best paid — with benefits to match. And because money means everything in public education — just ask the advocates — New York’s schools must be among America’s best. Right? Not really. If anything, New York’s public schools are mediocre — and none more so than New York City’s 1,800 non-charter schools. Sure, some are great — but most aren’t and overall, the city Department of Education doesn’t begin to produce results commensurate with the $22,000 it spent per pupil last year. Remember, the city has a high-school dropout rate exceeding 30 percent (probably much higher when GED program manipulation and other scams are factored in). A recent independent study showed that as many as 60 percent of city kids who managed to graduate can’t do college-level work without extensive remediation. So there’s the dilemma: New York’s schools are wealthy beyond reason in a state otherwise strapped for public resources — and overall classroom performance is embarrassingly poor. It’s as if there’s a disconnect between the two. Which, of course, there is. In some parallel universe, this circumstance might be taken as a challenge to do better — to raise performance to a level that justifies the spending. But not in New York. Here, the practice is to camouflage dysfunction with deceit, to resist reasonable reform with high-decibel bombast and — always and forever — to demand more money. And why not? It works — for the establishment, anyway. see also NY spends more money per-student than any other US state In New York City, United Federation of Teachers President Mike Mulgrew leveraged his union’s vast treasury into effective control of the schools — enticing Mayor de Blasio to sign a teachers-union contract so rich that it’ll blow out the next round of Census Bureau spending stats; hobbling charter-school and related reforms; and effectively silencing discussion of school-performance shortfalls. For Mulgrew, that’s still not enough. “If [Gov. Cuomo’s education] budget proposal becomes law,” he said last winter, “then I am sorry folks. Our governor [will have done] more harm to public education than any other governor in the history of New York state.” Much if this is kabuki. In the end, Mulgrew not only got the state budget he wanted — the plushest in the nation, as reflected in the Census stats, got even fatter — but he appears to have coerced Cuomo into walking away from reforms the governor previously supported strongly. Among them, at least for now, was a proposal to increase the number of charter schools in New York City. While the issue isn’t settled — the Legislature might yet come through before it adjourns later this month — that won’t happen without a vicious fight. That’s because charter schools represent an almost existential threat to the gravy train reflected in the Census Bureau figures. Almost a generation of experience demonstrates that they work — not perfectly, but better than the average New York City public school. And they do so without the feather-bedding work rules and other impediments to actual education that make up the UFT ethic. No wonder Mulgrew wants them to die. And then there’s this: New York’s budgeteers — both at City Hall and in Albany — have had an easy time of it in recent years. Cash has been pouring in. But both city Comptroller Scott Stringer and his Albany counterpart, Tom DiNapoli, have been warning for months of a softening economy — and this comes at a time when competition for mass-transit, social-services and housing dollars is increasing sharply. If nothing else, a summer of collapsing subway service stands to prompt a long-overdue look at the gap between spending and performance in New York’s public schools. If other big states do better, more cheaply, why can’t we? This time, bombast and deceit may not be enough. Bob McManus is a contributing editor to the Manhattan Institute’s City Journal.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. “I’m not here to repeal the Second Amendment,” Hillary Clinton promised at the Democratic National Convention last week. “I’m not here to take away your guns.” Those disavowals were necessary because Clinton has made gun control a centerpiece of her presidential campaign, contrary to the conventional wisdom about the political risks that entails. But Clinton’s assurances ring hollow, since it’s pretty clear she not only doesn’t value the individual right to keep and bear arms but doesn’t believe it’s guaranteed by the Constitution. After Democrats’ losses in the 1994 congressional elections and the 2000 presidential contest were widely blamed on their support for gun control, the party changed its platform. In 2004, Democrats promised to “protect Americans’ Second Amendment right to own firearms,” while the 2008 and 2012 platforms both included this sentence: “We recognize that the individual right to bear arms is an important part of the American tradition, and we will preserve Americans’ Second Amendment right to own and use firearms.” This year Democrats erased the Second Amendment from their platform, reverting to the approach they took in 2000 and earlier. The 2016 platform mentions “the rights of responsible gun owners” but says nothing about the extent of those rights or the legal basis for them. The Second Amendment’s excision from the Democratic platform is consistent with Clinton’s opinion that District of Columbia v. Heller, the 2008 case in which the Supreme Court recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to armed self-defense, was “wrongly decided.” At the very least, that position means Clinton thinks the Second Amendment doesn’t guarantee the right to use guns for self-defense in the home, since the law overturned in Heller made it impossible to exercise that right. But Clinton’s disagreement with the Supreme Court seems to go even further. In an interview last June, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos pressed her to say whether “an individual’s right to bear arms is a constitutional right.” She repeatedly dodged the question. “If it is a constitutional right,” Clinton said, “then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulation.” She seemed to be saying that she does not believe people have a constitutional right to firearms but that even voters who do believe that should be OK with her gun-control proposals. Those proposals provide further reason to doubt Clinton’s sincerity. She wants to ban so-called assault weapons, repeal the federal law that shields gun suppliers from legal liability for criminal misuse of their products, create new categories of people who are legally disqualified from owning firearms, and extend the federal background check requirement to all gun transfers. In other words, Clinton wants to arbitrarily restrict the kinds of guns Americans can legally buy, create a new financial threat to the industry that provides the means for armed self-defense, take away people’s constitutional rights without due process, and block gun purchases by cannabis consumers, people with nonviolent felony records, and anyone who was ever forcibly treated for suicidal impulses. These are not policies that someone who takes the Second Amendment seriously would favor. The night before Clinton promised to “work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms,” survivors of mass shootings and relatives of people who died in them ascended the stage to make the case for those policies. Like the speeches at the Republican convention about people murdered by illegal immigrants, these presentations were long on emotion and short on logic. Once you consider the details of those mass shootings, it is clear the policies Clinton favors wouldn’t have prevented them. Presenting these horrifying deaths as reasons to enact Clinton-style gun control is not an argument; it’s a non sequitur. According to a tweet from the Clinton campaign, this naked attempt at emotional manipulation was “the first time in #DemConvention history” that the gathering included “a full feature on the impact of gun violence.” Voters will decide whether it’s the last.

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Polls show voters are jumping to the same conclusion as much of Washington: that President Trump “colluded” with Vladimir Putin to steal the presidential election. But the evidence doesn’t back that up. Instead, such perceptions are driven by a number of key government and media assertions, which on closer inspection, dissolve into illusion: MYTH: “We have 17 intelligence agencies that know — with great certitude — that [the DNC hacking] was done by the Russians [to help Trump],” House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) recently said, echoing AP, CNN, The New York Times, NBC and CBS, among others. FACT: The Obama administration’s Jan. 6 assessment reflected the views of just three intelligence agencies — and one of them, the NSA, which captures Russian signals, expressed only “moderate confidence” in the conclusion. The others, the CIA and FBI, cautioned their judgment “might be wrong.” The FBI and CIA reached their conclusion based on the forensic analysis of a private contractor who was hired by the DNC to examine its hacked e-mail server. “We didn’t get direct access [to the server],” former FBI Director James Comey testified. MYTH: In a quid pro quo with Moscow, the Trump campaign “gutted,” as The Washington Post described it, the GOP’s anti-Russia platform position on Ukraine. FACT: The final convention platform actually added tougher language on Russian aggression, including calling for “increasing sanctions against Russia unless and until Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored.” MYTH: Much of the notorious “Steele Dossier,” despite being paid for by the Clinton campaign, still “checks out” (New York Times) or has “proven to be accurate” (Washington Post). FACT: The parts of the dossier the media are citing as true are merely echoes of their own reporting. Even a recent WaPo analysis of the 35-page document concedes that “many claims involve things that would have been publicly known at the time the report was drafted.” Some press accounts have treated the dossier’s allegation that Russian officials offered Trump adviser Carter Page billions to end US sanctions as confirmed in September 2016 reporting by Yahoo News’ Michael Isikoff. But Isikoff’s “Western intelligence source” was almost surely the dossier itself. So the media used the dossier to corroborate the dossier. (Page, who has repeatedly denied under oath he met with the Russian officials cited in the dossier, is suing Yahoo News over the Isikoff story.) What doesn’t check out at all, though, is the dossier’s most serious charge: that Trump officials secretly met with Kremlin officials overseas to hatch the hacking scheme against the Clinton campaign. The idea that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen traveled to Prague in August 2016 to meet with “Kremlin representatives and associated operators/hackers” to discuss “how to process deniable cash payments to . . . anti-Clinton hackers paid by both Trump team and Kremlin” has been debunked. Cohen denied ever visiting Prague; his passport carries no stamps showing he left or entered the US at the time; Czech authorities found no evidence he visited Prague; and University of Southern California officials confirm he was on campus visiting his son during that time. MYTH: Russian interference in the election opens the door to questioning the results of the 2016 election and the legitimacy of the Trump presidency. FACT: The Obama intel assessment concluded none of the Russian hacking targets was “involved in vote tallying.” And several states, including Wisconsin and California, now deny initial government reports that their election systems were ever even “scanned” by Russian cyber actors. Obama himself said any intrusions did not compromise the election results: “The election was not tarnished . . . We have not seen evidence of machines being tampered with.” MYTH: Russia launched a social media campaign that was “pivotal” to Trump’s victory: CNN. FACT: Facebook data reveal there was no real strategy behind the social-media ads paid in rubles. Most never mentioned either candidate. Geographic distribution was broad, targeting even non-battleground states like Maryland and Texas. Virtually all the Michigan and Wisconsin ads ran in 2015, which hardly helped Trump in 2016. Russian Twitter and Facebook bots trolled both the left and the right with agitprop — in what appears to have been a general effort to deepen divisions and sow political chaos in America, not to favor one party or candidate over the other. Judging by the rampant mythology on this issue, that part was successful. Paul Sperry is a former Hoover Institution media fellow and author of several nonfiction books. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Word that ObamaCare premiums will soar 25 percent in the 39 states that operate off the federal healthcare.gov system is only the tip of the iceberg: The so-called Affordable Care Act is inflicting damage all across America’s health-care sector — with no end in sight. Just as critics warned from the start. Premiums are rising in nearly all the states that run their own exchanges, too. And if you get other coverage, you’re also paying: ObamaCare taxes non-exchange health plans to help pay for the subsidies that make its policies (somewhat) affordable. (It also cut tens of billions from Medicare.) This, on top of the regulations that impact policies across America — boosting costs by mandating added coverage, whether you want it or not. The move forced insurers to cancel coverage for 6 million-plus people — even as tens of millions found that, no, they couldn’t keep their doctor after all. More, the law also pushed consolidation — penalizing doctors who stay in independent practice, rewarding hospitals that merge. All because the liberals who wrote the law saw such competition as destructive. Oh, and the nonprofit “insurance cooperatives” created with tens of billions in federal funds have nearly all failed. Still ahead: Budget crises in the states that accepted temporary federal bribes to massively expand their Medicaid rolls. More premium hikes on the exchanges, as ever fewer healthy people sign up for coverage — prompting even lower enrollment, and more price hikes, in a sharp “death spiral.” The “Cadillac tax” will kick in soon, too — so if your union has won great health coverage at the bargaining table, that plan will pay a penalty to Uncle Sam. The legal challenges aren’t done yet, either. How did it come to this? Voter fury in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis gave Democrats huge majorities in Congress — and President Obama took the opportunity to chase a decades-old liberal dream, universal health insurance. The law’s fallen far short of that goal, as it’s faltered on every other front, because it was never really written to work, but assembled from the wish-lists of various left-wing wonks and ideologues — hastily stitched together and passed before the voters could stop it. The Democrats didn’t even blink when Massachusetts, of all states, elected a Republican to Ted Kennedy’s Senate seat in a giant cry of “stop”: They passed the law before Scott Brown could take office. Now ObamaCare is collapsing, and presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton vows to “fix” it with new spending and even more Washington control of the market. If she gets Democratic majorities in Congress, she’ll keep that promise — and the madness will grow. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. YOUNGSTOWN, Pa. — Ken Reed sat down at the main bar of the Tin Lizzy tavern with two things in mind: to dig into the tavern’s oversize cheese steak, and watch the presidential debate. “I am hungry and undecided, in that order,” he said, digging into the savory dish in a bar that dates back to 1746. Kady Letoksy, a paralegal by day, a waitress and bartender at night at the Tin Lizzy, sat beside him. At 28, she has never voted before, and she is now thinking it might be a good idea to start. Letosky entered the evening undecided in a town that is heavily Democratic in registration. Her sister and father are on opposite sides of the political aisle. Donald “Trump had the upper hand this evening,” she said, citing his command of the back-and-forth between him and Hillary Clinton. Reed, 35, is a registered Democrat and small businessman. “By the end of the debate, Clinton never said a thing to persuade me that she had anything to offer me or my family or my community,” he said, sitting at the same bar that has boasted local icons as regulars, such as the late Fred Rogers, and Arnold Palmer, who had his own stash of PM Whiskey hidden behind newer bottles of whiskey for his regular visits. “Have to say Trump had the edge this evening, he came out swinging but also talked about specifics on jobs and the economy,” Reed said. Reed said Clinton came across as either smug or as though she was reading her résumé, adding there was nothing on her résumé that touched on his life. “I am a small businessman, a farmer, come from a long line of farmers and coal miners. The policies she talked about tonight ultimately either hurt me or ignore me,” he said. How apropos for this presidential election that these patrons chose the Tin Lizzy — a 270-year-old tavern in this small Westmoreland County town — as the place to watch the historic debate between Clinton and Trump. The tavern’s namesake is the Model T, the first affordable automobile available to America’s working class, which eventually became slang for something quite different. If someone said you were “going the way of the Tin Lizzy,” it meant your job or industry was in decline, no longer useful. That is how today’s cosmopolitan and political classes view Main Street voters — as people whose values, traditions, skills, jobs and lives are being replaced by something new. “I’ve been a Democrat all of my life, but when Clinton mentions her husband and the jobs he brought to the country in the ’90s, it’s not a fair assessment. She is no moderate Democrat the way he was, her policies would not bring back jobs,” said Nathan Nemick. It burns Nemick when Clinton references her husband, like she did in the debate on trade and jobs. “She is nothing like him,” he said of the Democrat he admired in his youth. Pennsylvania is a high-stakes state for both candidates, but particularly Clinton, and Westmoreland is a high-stakes county, particularly for Trump. She needs to win this state, and he needs not just to win this county but to do so by 2,000 more votes than Mitt Romney did in 2012. Westmoreland is one of about 10 formerly or traditionally Democrat-blue counties across the state where Trump must drive up a higher-than-normal turnout, or even flip them to Republican red, in order to offset an anticipated high turnout for Clinton in Philadelphia. The other counties are Cambria, Greene, Fayette and Washington in the southwest corner of the state and Bucks, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Luzerne and York in the east. Between 1960 and 2000, Westmoreland County Democrats handily won presidential races with one exception: Ronald Reagan’s 1980 victory. By 1984, voters here were back to their Democratic allegiances, giving their votes to Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton. When Al Gore turned the party toward its progressive wing in 2000, however, he left behind Westmoreland County Democrats. Democrats here are more traditional in their values — they are pro-gun, pro-life, pro-coal, something today’s Democratic Party has left no room for. Trump probably connects better with such voters than did Romney in 2012, or John McCain in 2008; a large part of the reason is his outside-the-box style. Yet for him to win the state, such voters need to turn out in force — here and elsewhere — to offset Philly’s overwhelming numbers. Before the debate, the latest CNN poll showed a virtual tie in the Keystone State. Outside the bar, a lone sign lit up the quiet corner of the old Lincoln Highway: “RIP Mr. Palmer, Forever in our hearts,” honoring Arnold Palmer, who died Sunday. “He was just a regular guy, just a working-class guy at heart like everyone else around here,” said Jim Sciabica, the unofficial bar manager and small businessman who kept “Mr. Palmer’s” PM Whiskey tucked in a corner away from patrons and workers. Other viewers across the country were disappointed in what they saw from both sides of the debate: Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The specter of a $100 million libel suit scared CNN into retracting a poorly reported story that slimed an ally of President Trump’s — and forcing out the staffers responsible for it, The Post has learned. The cable network’s coverage of Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci came amid federal scrutiny of corporate parent Time Warner’s pending purchase by AT&T — and the widespread belief among media execs that CNN President Jeff Zucker can’t survive a merger. CNN immediately caved after Scaramucci, a financier and frequent network guest, cried foul and threatened to take legal action, sources said Tuesday. Scaramucci got an unusual public apology but still hired a top Manhattan lawyer to put further pressure on CNN and “look after [his] interests in this matter,” one source said. Sources also said the three journalists responsible for the retracted story — reporter Tom Frank, editor Eric Lichtblau and Lex Haris, who headed the CNN Investigates unit — were urged to resign. “They called them in and said they’d pay out their contracts, but they should leave immediately,” one source said. Zucker was afraid of facing a high-profile suit from Scaramucci while the US Justice Department weighs the proposed $85.4 billion media merger. Meanwhile, a CNN insider said staffers are furious at “having lost the moral high ground because of this story.” Sources said Zucker tried to rally his staff during a Tuesday morning conference call. “Zucker stressed that this issue was a ‘lapse in editorial standards’ and said it was a lesson to all reporters and editors to continue to strive for strong, accurate reporting,” a source said. At last week’s Cannes Lions festival in France — where Zucker boasted that viewers trust CNN “more than ever” — rumors were rife that he’d be out of a job if the AT&T deal goes through. “It’s not just Jeff Zucker, all Time Warner executives are anxious about if they will survive the merger,” a media source said Tuesday. “What is interesting is that the AT&T execs who will decide who goes and who stays are [AT&T CEO] Randall Stephenson and [AT&T Entertainment Group CEO] John Stankey — who have a very good relationship with the current administration.” see also Trump remains CNN's number one critic Trump — a fierce critic of CNN — publicly opposed the merger during the campaign. Sources said Scaramucci, a frequent guest on CNN to defend the president, was treated like a star at Saturday’s wedding of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Louise Linton in Washington, DC. “Everyone at the White House has been high-fiving each other over Anthony’s success in embarrassing CNN,” one attendee said. “Trump is thoroughly enjoying this, and Anthony got endless slaps on the back at Steve’s wedding.” The retracted story was based on a single, anonymous source who claimed the Senate Intelligence Committee was probing ties between the Trump administration and a Russian government-owned investment fund. The story, posted on CNN.com on Thursday, also claimed the Treasury Department was believed to be investigating Scaramucci over a purported Jan. 16 meeting with the fund’s director general.

Lies, omissions and false fact checks – a banner week for media disinformation The week in whoppers: Psaki's huffy hypocrisy, CNN's clueless criticism and more Congressmen secretly visit Kabul, blast war as 'failure upon failure' In an Editor’s Note posted late Friday, CNN said the story had been deleted for not meeting “editorial standards,” with the network later revealing a “breakdown” in pre-publication vetting that typically involves “fact-checkers, journalism standards experts and lawyers.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday she wasn’t sure if CNN’s handling of the matter was “good enough” for her boss, who went on a Twitter tirade against the news channel earlier in the day. “I think that we have gone to a place where if the media can’t be trusted to report the news, then that’s a dangerous place for America, and I think if that is the place that certain outlets are going, particularly for the purpose of spiking ratings, and if that’s coming directly from the top, I think that’s even more scary,” she said. “I think that we should take a really good look at what we are focused on, what we are covering, and making sure that it’s actually accurate and it’s honest,” she added. CNN’s retraction of the Scaramucci story was the latest in a string of recent embarrassments, including the firing earlier this month of “Believer” series host Reza Aslan after he called Trump a “piece of s–t” on Twitter. The network also fired comedian Kathy Griffin — longtime co-host of its New Year’s Eve coverage — over a photo that showed her posing with a prop resembling Trump’s bloody, severed head, and had to own up to a story that incorrectly predicted what fired FBI Director James Comey would testify about before Congress. CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Following Friday’s apology, Scaramucci tweeted that “CNN did the right thing. Classy move. Apology accepted. Everyone makes mistakes. Moving on.” On Tuesday, he retweeted a message from CNN “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter saying that “nothing in my story should be taken to imply that Scaramucci is under investigation,” as well as a meme portraying Trump as Batman driving the Batmobile. The image also shows Vice President Mike Pence as Robin, holding the “Bat Phone” and saying: “SORRY HE CAN’T TALK RIGHT NOW — HE’S BUSY WINNING!!!!” Additional reporting by Bob Fredericks and Bruce Golding Share Selection",

Even as President Obama faced criticism for getting $400,000 for a speech to a Wall Street bank, he pocketed the same amount of money for a second speech, The Post has learned. Obama made another $400,000 on Thursday when he appeared at the A&E Networks advertising upfront at The Pierre Hotel. He was interviewed over 90 minutes at the Midtown Manhattan event by presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin in front of the cable network’s advertisers. Out of office just 98 days, Obama caught some flack earlier this week when it was learned that he had agreed to speak in September at a health care event sponsored by Wall Street bank Cantor Fitzgerald. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she was “troubled” by the big-ticket talk. At the A&E event, Obama got a standing ovation when he entered the room. Asked about what he missed most about the White House, he said it was sitting on the Truman Balcony on summer nights and gazing at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, a source in attendance said. Obama also told the crowd that in his three months out of office, he has not yet been behind the wheel of a car and he’s learning how to use the coffee machine in the Obamas’ new home in Washington, DC. The event, called a History Makers lunch and put together by A&E’s History Channel, was hosted by A&E chief Nancy Dubuc. Goodwin asked Obama how, while president, he handled frustrating moments. She mentioned that Abraham Lincoln would write angry letters, then put them in a desk and not mail them. Obama responded: “For starters, by not having a Twitter account.” Among the luminaries were Harvey Weinstein, Anna Wintour, Bob Sauerberg, Janice Min and Penske Media CEO Jay Penske.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. A panel of state judges just taught New York City students a clear-cut lesson: It’s OK to cheat on tests. Yep: That’s the message from the Appellate Division decision that upheld a lower court’s ruling reinstating Bronx elementary school teacher Ericka Bolt to her $78,000-a-year job. Mind you, the five-judge panel agreed with an arbitrator’s finding that Bolt helped her students cheat on a state English exam by telling kids to change incorrect answers. But four of the five judges ruled that, given her previous “unblemished record,” firing her for a “one-time mistake” actually “shocks our sense of fairness.” What shocks us is their sense of what constitutes acceptable teacher behavior. We don’t know if it was a one-time event. The only reason this came to light was because several of her students asked for similar help from other teachers on exams the next year — plainly thinking it appropriate. Those students scored much lower that following year than they had with Bolt’s help. The four judges actually considered it a point in Bolt’s favor that she “did not provide the students with the correct answer” — as if that was a lesser form of cheating. Talk about defining deviancy down — the syndrome, coined by the late Sen. Pat Moynihan, in which society keeps lowering the standard of appropriate behavior. We’re more persuaded by the lone dissenter, Justice John Sweeny, who agreed with the arbitrator that Bolt “had the responsibility to set an example to 10-year-old students” and that her actions “irrevocably compromised her ability to serve as a role model.” All this comes as a new report by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute says that getting rid of ineffective public-school teachers in New York City is harder than “in almost any other district in the country.” And that’s not even considering the added barrier imposed by the courts. Teachers need to teach, not cheat. Putting Ericka Bolt back in the classroom won’t help any of her students. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Over years, New Hampshire earned its reputation for upending conventional wisdom, but the 2016 campaign is also leaving another legacy. When Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem tried to shame and bully young women into supporting Hillary Clinton, they inadvertently revealed a dirty secret of the left’s fixation on gender, race and ethnicity. They demonstrated that hiding behind the gauzy appeals to make history is a willingness to use brass knuckles to achieve conformity. In their warped vision, biology trumps individuality, and those who don’t agree are traitors to their gender. That’s not just unappealing, it’s also un-American. Our democracy is energized and more representative when no vote is taken for granted. The demands for conformity by Clinton’s henchwomen mirror the anti-free-speech movements on college campuses, but are striking because they came from a former secretary of state and a feminist icon, both of whom struggled against demeaning stereotypes in their own careers. They now ape the sexists they fought. Albright especially struck a sour note when she declared that “there’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.” Clinton laughed and clapped at the statement. Steinem separately accused young women of supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders because “the boys are with Bernie.” She also insulted those who favor Donald Trump, saying they only liked him for his money. If he “lost his wallet, there would be no women in sight,” she told Women’s Health magazine. The bullying smears are backfiring, but before the incidents give way to new outrages borne of Clinton Entitlement Syndrome, some context is useful. For one thing, neither Albright nor Steinem was thinking of Carly Fiorina or any female candidate other than Clinton when they insisted on conformity. So their demands amount to a selective use of gender as a partisan club, which ghettoizes female voters. For another, Hillary’s enforcers are not alone in dipping into the gutter, with smears also leveled at Republican candidates who don’t fit a racial mold. Some liberals have called Dr. Ben Carson, a distinguished surgeon running for president, an “Uncle Tom” for being a conservative, as if all black Americans must think and vote the same way. Cuban-American senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are routinely accused of running from their Latin roots because they are Republicans who oppose illegal immigration. Again, the suffocating implication is that being an authentic Latino means being a liberal Democrat supporting open borders. The pattern is not new, yet it is new that it no longer works. The 2016 race is turning politics upside down, and Albright and Steinem are among the establishment gatekeepers whose power is ebbing. Acting like bitter reactionaries, they resort to intimidation. The world is passing them by. Consider that nearly 60 percent of Iowa Republicans caucused for Cruz, Rubio or Carson, a powerful statement about growing diversity in one party. Consider, too, that the nation’s two Indian-American governors, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Nikki Haley of South Carolina, are both Republicans. One of two African-Americans in the Senate, Tim Scott, is also from South Carolina. (Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey is the other.) The demographic scrambling helps explain the decline of Clinton’s support among women. After Sanders beat her by 70 points in Iowa among all people under the age of 30, New Hampshire polls gave him a 64-to-35 percent edge among women under 45. Part of her problem is generational, with Albright, at age 78, and Steinem, 81, stuck in a time warp while many young women say they are free to support Sanders for the same reason men do: They find him more authentic, and her less honest. Hi New Hampshire! 💕 I'm so happy to be here for @berniesanders and to speak at the rally tonight! It will be streaming online at www.berniesanders.com, I will be on around 5:30! ❤️ Wearing a sweater designed by the wonderful @grantknits #feelthebern #votetogether ❄️ A photo posted by Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Feb 8, 2016 at 1:57pm PST It’s also true that Clinton’s political career is impossible to separate from her husband’s. Her first Senate race was launched on the wave of public pity after the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and she cites her husband’s presidency as a reason why she should have her own. Is that modern feminism? That awkward history has diminishing benefits for a new generation. Model and actress Emily Ratajkowski captured the moment when she aimed a barb at Steinem by telling a rally, “I’m here because I support Bernie Sanders . . . I’m not here for the boys.” And in a direct dig at Clinton, Ratajkowski said, “I want my first female president to be more than a symbol.” We all should. Preet Bharara doesn’t just do something about political corruption, he also talks about it. And that’s almost as important. By failing to point out the crooks, the New York pols who aren’t corrupt have done little to distinguish themselves from those who are. That was the tough message the Manhattan federal prosecutor delivered on a rare visit to Albany. “You think no one knew Sheldon Silver was corrupt before he was put in handcuffs?” he said of the convicted former Assembly speaker. “Not a chance,” he answered, adding, “No one made a call, no one blew a whistle, no one sounded an alarm.” He might have added that a series of private businesses also went along with the scams without complaint, especially real estate giant Glenwood Management. Bharara has been a one-man gang, convicting a raft of city and state officials, including Democrat Silver and former Republican state Senate leader Dean Skelos. Both await sentencing. Yet Bharara also distinguishes himself by repeatedly reminding the public of the high cost of corruption. Beyond the actual theft in taxpayer dollars, the resulting cynicism drives a giant wedge between the public and government officials. Even more distressing, New Yorkers are so numb that they feel there is little they can do about it. A recent poll found that nearly 90 percent believe the state is rife with corruption, but most regard the situation as close to inevitable. Albany, of course, takes comfort from such findings, as illustrated by the absence of any talk of serious reform from Gov. Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders. Their attitude seems to be that if the public doesn’t care enough to get mad, why should they? Bharara still cares, that’s why. The airwaves and opinion pages are filled with trial balloons for a Michael Bloomberg presidential run, and the former mayor clearly is itching to throw his fat wallet into the ring. But amid all the heated claims that he can triumph, here’s the obvious question: What states could he win to put together even a plurality of the Electoral College? If that’s too tough, here’s an easier one: Name a single state he can count on winning. I’ll wait. The latest buzzwords coming out of Washington are a tongue twister. Some people demand a “Zika czar.” Try to say that 10 times in a hurry. Share Selection",

To hear liberal concern trolls tell it, the presumed defeat of Donald Trump will be the end of the Republican Party. “Today’s GOP Crackup Is the Final Unraveling of Nixon’s Southern Strategy,” said The Nation. “Donald Trump Takes to Twitter to Stoke a GOP Civil War,” claimed Mother Jones. “GOP Civil War: Trump Camp Officially Severs Ties with Ohio GOP Chairman,” said Talking Points Memo. In The Washington Post, Robert Costa put the apocalypse in this tweet: “The election ends in 19 days. A grievance movement looms. Norms shattered, a city paralyzed. A party at war.” I could go on for, according to Google, approximately 9,888,000 more examples. And to be fair, many conservatives believe we are having a Fort Trumpter moment, too. But Trump’s tangles with other Republicans won’t develop into anything, because Trump will go away. And the Trump page in American history won’t actually change much in the Republican Party. Assuming Trump loses by a large margin, which appears to be the likeliest outcome, Trump voters will hardly be in a position to lecture the rest of the party on what a great candidate he was, or how his ideas represented a promising new future, though they will spend a few weeks fuming at the so-called “Cuckservatives” who reject all identity politics — including white identity politics. Meanwhile, mainstream Republicans, such as the leaders of National Review and The Weekly Standard, will not quite be able to resist the urge to say “I told you so,” and there will be bad blood. But a week is a long time in politics. Remember when Donald Trump’s tax write-off was going to be the thing that swung the election? Ancient history, and that was only three weeks ago. The midterms aren’t for two years. What the pundits aren’t thinking about now is the factor that unites everyone on the right, from the open-borders-and-weed libertarians to the build-that-wall alt-right: loathing Hillary. And there’s going to be a lot to loathe. Horrified by virtually everything Hillary Clinton says and does, everyone on the right will join forces because our great common interest is control of the Senate in 2018. Midterm elections generally favor the party that does not hold the White House. Clinton will come into office with unprecedented disapproval ratings, and the map will hugely favor Republicans. Five Democratic senators will be defending seats in red states, with several more looking vulnerable in swing states. Roll Call estimates that Democrats have cause to worry about perhaps 11 seats. Overall, Democrats will be defending 24 seats against only 10 for the Republicans. ‘The Trump page in American history won’t actually change much in the Republican Party’ By the middle of next year, whether Paul Ryan was sufficiently critical or supportive of Donald Trump will be about as hot a topic as the Volstead Act. Besides, a post-election Trump will be so wacky — remember, the last few months have featured Big D at his most presidential — that supporting him won’t be like being a Barry Goldwater fan in the 1970s. It’ll be more like being a Limp Bizkit fan today. Pundits who obsessively follow each twist and turn frequently make the mistake of graphing the future as a straight line out from today. Remember the spate of books claiming 2008 heralded Victory Forever for the Democrats? Books like “The Death of Conservatism” by Sam Tanenhaus and “40 More Years: How the Democrats Will Rule the Next Generation” by James Carville? Today, the Democrats are at an 86-year-low in both House and Senate seats. There are Republican governors in 31 states. Republicans groaned about John McCain and Mitt Romney, then voted for both. Even Trump, despite being a lifelong liberal, previous Clinton supporter and apparent serial groper, is getting the vast majority of the GOP vote because he’s the most conservative option. Politics may be about ideals, but elections are often about picking the option you dislike least. No matter what, the party’s policy will be to the right of whatever the Democrats want. Trump is a singular phenomenon, a one-off, a dazzling shooting star that just appeared briefly in the political firmament, called the ladies “pieces of a–” and disappeared. He leaves behind no Make America Great Again party, no base in the House or the Senate, nobody to carry the banner of Trumpism, just a few Scott Baios and Gen. Mike Flynns. No matter how angry Trump voters may be with Republicans for trying to save the GOP from disaster on Nov. 8, they’ll soon remember the basic rule of third parties in America: They represent wasted votes.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. If you can’t win, change the rules. That’s the Democratic Party’s new playbook. Democrats are urging the US Supreme Court to redraw Wisconsin’s electoral map, claiming Republican lawmakers drew it unfairly. If the justices toss Wisconsin’s map and dictate new rules for election mapmaking, it could turn winners into losers and vice versa in many states. Republicans have been on a winning streak and now control both legislative houses in 33 states, including Wisconsin. They rightly oppose this judicial interference. The justices will hear the case, Gill v. Whitford, on Oct. 3. Democrats claim Wisconsin’s election map puts them at a disadvantage by packing their voters into too few election districts, “wasting” their votes and allowing Republicans to win the majority of districts. But the real problem isn’t an unfair map. It’s that Wisconsin Democrats are concentrated in cities. In many states, Democrats tend to win urban voters and do less well with suburban and rural voters. Wisconsin Democrats want the lines redrawn so their urban voters can capture a majority of the state’s legislative seats — and they’re asking the Supreme Court to help them. It’s a brazen political gambit disguised as fairness. They claim to be victims of gerrymandering — drawing election districts to favor one party. But they’re not opposed to gerrymandering. They just want it to favor them. They hope a Supreme Court victory will restore their political fortunes after the 2020 Census, when states have to redraw their electoral maps. If Democrats prevail in court, the nation’s political map could change significantly after the Census, with many statehouses flipped to Democratic control. That would likely mean higher state taxes, anti-fracking laws and job-killing regulations on business. As for gerrymandering, it’s been around for over 200 years and isn’t limited to any party. When James Madison ran for Congress in 1788, rival politicians, including his mortal enemy Patrick Henry, drew district lines to try to exclude Madison’s supporters. Madison won anyway, but manipulating voting districts for partisan advantage was just getting started. Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and Constitutional Convention delegate, raised it to an art form in 1812, carving a bizarre district in his state that meandered around Boston like a salamander. A Boston newspaper caricatured it, adding claws, fangs and a tail, and called it a Gerry-mander. That political monster has been with us ever since. It’s one of the tools pols in both parties use — along with arcane ballot-access rules and the perks of incumbency — to rig elections and exclude competition. At its worst, it deprives voters of any meaningful self-government. But this corrupt gerrymandering should be cleaned up by the voters — not the federal courts. Is there a practical solution? Yes. Voters in 13 states have already set up independent or bipartisan commissions to draw district lines after each Census. In 2014, New York state approved a constitutional amendment establishing a redistricting commission, but unfortunately it allows the Legislature to ultimately reject whatever map the commission proposes. Iowa’s remedy is better, barring any consideration of partisan affiliation when lines are drawn. But don’t confuse that with what Wisconsin Democrats are trying to do. In Wisconsin, there are no salamander-shaped election districts. But Democrats want to rig the rules to increase the clout of urban voters, even if it requires drawing strangely shaped districts. In the past the Supreme Court has refused to meddle in partisan gerrymandering cases. As Justice Antonin Scalia explained in a 2004 ruling, “political gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable” — meaning strictly political matters. That’s how the justices should rule again in the Wisconsin case. If Democrats want to return to power, they’ll need to broaden their appeal and win over more of America’s nonurban voters.

In her sworn testimony made public this week, longtime Clinton aide Cheryl Mills proved that Team Hillary won’t give up an ounce of truth without a fight. Mills, Hillary Clinton’s chief of staff at the State Department, was deposed by lawyers for Judicial Watch, the watchdog that has driven most of the key revelations about Clinton’s email transgressions. Juiciest of all was Mills’ excuse for Clinton’s failure to turn over her emails, all official government information, on leaving office: There was “a lot going on.” “The secretary was not only transitioning, there had been a — we had lost our first ambassador [Christopher Stevens, in the Benghazi terrorist attack] in quite some time, and we were stepping through the sets of issues associated with that,” Mills said. Hmm. But then Clinton sat on the emails for two years, only handing them over after hackers revealed her secret setup. In fact, the record’s clear that she “went home-brew” precisely to frustrate Freedom of Information Act requests. Worse, Clinton and her inner circle all signed agreements promising to safeguard classified info — then winked as the private server put those secrets at risk. The rest of Mills’ testimony was just as tendentious, including 40 answers of “I don’t recall” and 182 of “I don’t know.” And the seven attorneys accompanying her objected to roughly 250 questions. Even when sworn to tell the truth, Hillary & Co. are all about the stonewall. Share Selection",

On Thursday, CNN will host a town hall with President Obama as part of his “final-year push to make gun control part of his legacy.” In addition to sitting down with liberal anchor Anderson Cooper, the network says Obama will “take questions from the audience.” Uh-oh. Get out your best pruning shears and trowels. In an age of micromanaged partisan stagecraft and left-wing media enablers, there is no such thing as a spontaneous question. CNN has a long history of allowing political plants to flourish in its public forums. At the cable station’s Democratic debate in Las Vegas in 2007, moderator Wolf Blitzer introduced several citizen questioners as “ordinary people, undecided voters.” But they later turned out to include a former Arkansas Democratic director of political affairs, the president of the Islamic Society of Nevada, and a far-left anti-war activist who’d been quoted in newspapers lambasting Harry Reid for his failure to pull out of Iraq. At a CNN/YouTube GOP debate two weeks later, the everyday, “undecided voters” whose questions were chosen included: Once a manipulative gardener, always a manipulative gardener. During the push for ObamaCare, Democratic plants spread like kudzu across town hall propaganda events. At White House “citizen town halls” in 2009, Team Obama hand-picked not-so-random “random” questioners who included: Using young people as horticultural conduits to shape narratives wasn’t an Obama invention, of course. Last week, Hillary Clinton’s town hall events featured two children reading scripted questions on gender pay equity and guns. The campaign balked at accusations that they would exploit kids and manufacture questions. But this is the campaign of the former secretary of state whose staff bragged in emails released last fall that it had “planted” questions with CBS News’s “60 Minutes” in 2011. And this is the woman whose 2008 presidential campaign staff admitted to providing prefab queries to a Grinnell College student in Iowa. Muriel Gallo-Chasanoff exposed how a senior Clinton staffer approached her with “a binder with pre-written questions.” She told CNN — attention, CNN! — that the “top one was planned specifically for a college student. … It said ‘college student’ in brackets and then the question.” Gallo-Chasanoff conceded to asking the question, which read: “As a young person, I’m worried about the long-term effects of global warming. How does your plan combat climate change?” Upon reflection, Gallo-Chasanoff felt ashamed of her cooperation with Democratic Kabuki theater and condemned the charade as “dishonest.” If only more self-respecting journalists felt the same way.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Brandon Victor Dixon’s remarks Friday night came from a good place. But they also yet again revealed the peculiar failure of liberal America to practice the empathy it preaches. The actor who plays Aaron Burr in “Hamilton” thanked Vice President-elect Mike Pence for coming to the show, then spoke up for “the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us . . . or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us.” The words were perfectly respectful — but the implication was downright rude. And blindly condescending. All the marches and media hysteria have made it quite plain how much alarm many feel over Donald Trump’s victory. More important: Pence had already sent a darn clear message by coming to see the show. He had just listened to the very voices Dixon (speaking for the cast) was asking him to hear. (Plus, facing scattered boos on the way into the theater, he’d also told his family, “That’s the sound of freedom.”) Yes, the president-elect took to Twitter to vent his displeasure; we’d rather he’d let others comment. (Stevie Van Zandt’s tweet was on point: “There has never been a more outspoken politically active artist than me. He was their guest. You protect your guests. Don’t embarrass them.”) But Pence took it all in stride, saying on “Fox News Sunday” that he and his family “really enjoyed the show” — “an incredible production and incredibly talented people.” He “wasn’t offended,” he said, and most important: “I just want to reassure people that what President-elect Donald Trump said on election night, he absolutely meant it from the bottom of his heart. He is preparing to be the president of all of the people of the United States of America.” In Sunday’s Post, Michael Goodwin asked liberals to consider that they might be “ignorant” about the lives of Trump voters — that they wrongly “swallowed, hook, line and sinker,” the “caricature of them the Democratic Party and the national liberal media created.” Liberals dominate the national media (and most local media, too) — as well as Hollywood, Broadway and Silicon Valley. Red America has no choice but to listen to Blue America all the time. And, sorry, it’s Blue America that routinely screams “Shut up” to voices it doesn’t want to hear. That’s the essence of political correctness, and not just on campus: Recall, for example, the PC condemnation of the incredibly sensitive and nuanced “red” film “American Sniper.” When you can’t understand how your fellow Americans could make “that man” our next president, maybe it’s time you stopped assuming it hasn’t heard you, and started listening yourselves.

How appropriate that former Govs. Jim Florio and Jim McGreevey were on hand as another New Jersey Democrat, Phil Murphy, presented his first budget last week. Because, like those predecessors (as well as the absent Jon Corzine), Murphy unveiled a plan that hikes government spending and taxes in ways that left veteran Trenton legislators stunned. Murphy called for $1.6 billion in new or increased taxes and $2.7 billion in new spending, a 4.2 percent jump in outlays. But it’s all OK, says Murphy, because it represents “investment” — with taxpayers’ money. “I don’t think anyone could have anticipated this level of tax increases,” said the clearly shocked Senate minority leader, Tom Kean Jr. Murphy made no bones about it, either: “We’re digging out of an eight-year narrative that was all about gutting government spending.” In other words, the days of at least some fiscal responsibility under Republican Chris Christie are over. Now it’s time for Garden Staters to empty their wallets. Indeed, Murphy proposed a host of new social programs without giving any hint of how he plans to pay for them all. In the process, he wants to hike the state sales tax back to where it was before Christie cut it to partly compensate for raising the gasoline tax. And he wants to impose new taxes on — well, basically everything: online sales, Uber and Lyft rides — even recreational marijuana, which he plans to legalize. And, of course, Murphy wants a so-called millionaire’s tax. But Senate President Steve Sweeney, a fellow Democrat, is opposed, even though he was its biggest advocate under Christie. The problem: Jersey’s crippling state and property taxes are no longer fully deductible under federal tax reform. Sweeney (unlike Murphy) recognizes that this means that new tax hikes — and the resulting fears of even more to come — would send wealthy taxpayers fleeing the state. And that’s a potential budget-buster, since the gross income tax is the state’s largest source of revenue and leaves it especially dependent on high earners. So now it’s up to Jersey’s Legislature to administer a much-needed reality-check slap in the face. If not, Murphy should consider this: New Jersey hasn’t had a two-term Democratic governor since Brendan Byrne. And he left office in 1982. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. President Biden’s speech Wednesday night failed on all counts: It didn’t sell his latest spending plan, it didn’t sell his larger agenda — and, worst of all, it didn’t sell him. Start with the utterly bizarre “mask theater.” All the politicians in the room have been fully vaccinated, and Biden’s own CDC says that’s enough. So why the universal masking, and the social distancing? The message, cutting across the president’s occasional optimism, was that this nightmare will never end — which simply isn’t true. Equally, obviously false was Biden’s now-routine effort to claim all the credit for successful vaccinations: All that was set in motion before he took office. Then he moved into a series of disjointed claims about his “American Families Plan” that barely tracked, even though he was reading a prepared text. It seemed like he was just skipping whole paragraphs and even pages. You could see even Democrats wincing above their masks. He tossed in a few blatant whoppers, like his repeated claims that economists “left, right and center” agree his program will work just as he says. Oh, and a classic Biden non sequitur, attacking those who oppose his plans to hike taxes on the rich: “Ask them, whose taxes are you going to raise?” “No one’s” is the answer — because the opposition isn’t looking to spend trillions more than the feds already do. Yet he never gave any clear unifying theme for the “families” plan, because it doesn’t have one. It’s just another grab bag of items off Democrats’ wish list. Then, bizarrely, he wandered into something like a State of the Union speech, ticking off mostly vacuous sales pitches for a host of bills he’d like Congress to pass. Mixed in were lies about how he’d solved the border crisis as vice president, plus vague waves at a foreign policy (and trade: He talks “buy American” as much as the guy he replaced) and some noise about being tough militarily when the Defense Department is about the only federal agency he doesn’t want to spend more on. The speech was packed with hoary clichés and empty rhetoric about unity, spiced with blather about “white supremacy” and “systemic racism” even as he was insisting (correctly) that nearly all cops only work hard to protect the public. After all that, his effort to close with the traditional message of hope fell pretty flat, because he was out to show confidence in America after failing to give America reason to have much confidence in him.

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Homeowners in an exclusive waterfront enclave in Brooklyn thought Hurricane Sandy was as cruel a blow as they could suffer — until the taxman proved them wrong. The city is claiming that property values have actually shot up for many homes in Manhattan Beach and it’s going ahead with hefty tax hikes for the houses devastated by the October superstorm, shocked property owners told The Post. Homeowners in other neighborhoods hit by Sandy, including Coney Island, the Rockaways and parts of Staten Island, also said they’ve received increases. “This is totally insensitive and heartless,” said Ira Zalcman, president of the Manhattan Beach Community Group, which has received more than 30 complaints from residents about the hikes. “We just sustained one of the worst national disasters in our nation’s history, and now the city is delusional, claiming our property values went up.” Zalcman said that since Sandy, he has spent roughly $100,000 repairing the basement of his Dover Street oceanfront home, for which he pays more than $7,000 a year in property taxes. He estimates his tax bill will go up nearly $200 for the fiscal year beginning July 1 because the city claims his property’s market value rose by $79,000 to slightly more than $2 million, increasing the home’s assessed value for tax purposes. He claims he’d be lucky to get $1.5 million. Meanwhile, other owners facing tax hikes say their homes are so badly damaged, they have yet to complete repairs and move back. One oceanfront home, at 295 Dover St., still had its windows and doors boarded up yesterday. But the city says its market value has jumped $473,000 the past year to $3.1 million. The owner, Olga Belenkaya, has yet to return because the home was so badly damaged by Sandy, neighbors said. Belenkaya did not return messages left on her cellphone. Councilman Michael Nelson (D-Brooklyn), whose district includes hard-hit Manhattan Beach, Sheepshead Bay and Brighton Beach — called the tax hikes “heartless” and “something the city must immediately remedy.” “Common sense dictates their property values have fallen, if not plummeted in some cases,” he said. Stephen “Butch” Moran, vice chairman of Community Board 13, said he’s “shocked” his taxes are going up for one of the homes he owns in Sheepshead Bay and Seagate, where Sandy left him with $300,000 worth of combined repairs. “How do you increase taxes for people who no longer have 100 percent of their homes remaining?” he said. Finance Department spokesman Owen Stone said any tax hikes are part of a capped, state-approved five-year formula for setting assessment levels. Property owners who oppose the hikes have until March 15 to appeal to the city Tax Commission before rates are finalized in May. But lawyer Alex Singer, who estimates he has spent “well over $100,000” fixing damage to his Manhattan Beach home after it was partly engulfed by seawater and raw sewage, said “it’s unconscionable” that the city didn’t just lower tax rates across the board in Sandy-ravaged neighborhoods. “It’s a matter of principle,” said Singer, 67, who was hit with a $56 increase on his yearly tax bill of $7,388 for the Girard Street home he has shared with wife Linda since 1975. Singer and other neighborhood residents were especially peeved because their property-value notices, predated Jan. 15, didn’t arrive until the first week of this month. The notices included an outdated memo informing homeowners that they had until Feb. 1 to apply for assistance through the Finance Department’s new Hurricane Sandy Property Tax Relief program. Stone, of the Finance Department, said that the program’s application deadline has been pushed back to Feb. 15, but added that the program has been available since late November. He said his agency is reviewing 2,900 applications citywide.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. With oil prices struggling to rebound after hitting a three-month low last week, Americans are getting yet another reminder of just how wrong President Barack Obama was about drilling. “The American people aren’t stupid,” he said back in 2012 — when the price of oil was above $100 a barrel and gas was $3.50-plus a gallon at the pump. They know “we can’t just drill our way to lower gas prices.” Well, he was right about one thing: Americans aren’t stupid. They wisely ignored him and drilled anyway. Guess what? Supplies rose and drove down prices. They haven’t come back since. Hug a fracker for that welcome turn of events: US oil output from shale has soared over the past decade, thanks to new fracking and horizontal-drilling technology that has lowered production costs and made shale-oil extraction economical. (And blame Gov. Cuomo for banning New Yorkers from taking part in the fracking boom.) The new reserves have disrupted the global oil market: While OPEC countries and Russia agreed last November to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels a day to run down inventory gluts, US output has grown: Drillers here have added oil rigs for the past eight straight weeks. The US supplies have kept world crude prices low — oil has been bouncing around just above the $50-a-barrel mark; gas, just below $2.50 a gallon — despite the cuts in output by OPEC and Russia. Indeed, those countries are now rethinking their production caps to hang on to their market share. But whether it’s America, OPEC or Russia that keeps the black stuff flowing, crude and gas-pump prices don’t seem headed up much anytime soon. That’s a godsend for consumers, as well as businesses and workers. No, there are no guarantees: If the global economy heats up and supplies can’t keep pace, prices will rise. But with all the new US drilling, America is now better poised to meet new demand and keep those prices in check. It sure is a good thing Obama was right about Americans’ intelligence.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. On Wednesday, Facebook launched a capital strike against the country of Australia. Rather than continue negotiations with Australia regarding paying for the news content circulating on its platform, Facebook decided to pull up stakes. Within hours, the company announced it would “restrict publishers and people in Australia” from sharing or viewing news content. This restriction was also global — Facebook users the world over would now be prohibited from posting links from Australian news publishers. In other words, a sovereign national government attempted to assert itself against Facebook. And in response, Facebook canceled the country. The details of this dispute largely concern ad revenue — details that are as complex as they are mundane. But to characterize Facebook’s actions as merely those of a private company engaging in contract negotiations wildly shades the reality of the near- hegemonic power Facebook has amassed over the global flow of information. Facebook consistently polls as a major news source in countries around the world. In poorer countries like Myanmar, it is virtually indistinguishable from the internet itself, which is why Myanmar’s government was able to successfully wield the platform to incite a genocide in 2018. In countries the world over, Facebook has intentionally wound itself around the infrastructure of how societies consume news, transmit information, and speak to one another. It has become a chokepoint for vital information. What is now clear is how easily that power can be weaponized on Facebook’s behalf. Within hours of Facebook’s announcement, the Facebook pages of Nine, News Corp., and the government-funded Australian Broadcasting Corp., which acts as a central information source during natural disasters, were blank. So too were the Facebook pages of major regional health departments, where a quarter of the country’s 25 million people regularly gather information regarding COVID-19. As bushfires rage across the country, the Facebook page of the Bureau of Meteorology was also wiped clean. Regional Department of Fire and Emergency Service offices were prevented from posting emergency bushfire warnings. The extent of Facebook’s power allows it to threaten a country’s government by holding hostage massive amounts of its social infrastructure. What we are witnessing is hardly a contractual dispute, but a power struggle between a sovereign self-government and a private corporation so dominant, it exists as a hegemon in its own right. It is very much a proxy for how global governments and their citizens are struggling with Big Tech companies which, by controlling the flow of information, are shaping the very boundaries of free and democratic societies. How this dispute ends, in Australia and the world over, will tell us who rules: Is it the people, speaking through their self-government, or the tech authoritarians, who arrogantly wield their power as unaccountable private superstates, to which we all must yield?

The World Health Organization is now advising everyone to wear face masks in public when they can’t practice social distancing — an about-face from its earlier guidance on stopping the spread of the coronavirus. WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the shift Friday, citing new evidence that showed face masks worn by healthy people could be “a barrier for potentially infectious droplets,” the BBC reported. WHO had always advised that sick people and their caretakers should wear medical face masks. The new guidance advises healthy people to wear non-medical face masks. WHO officials for months have stood firm that a healthy person would get a false sense of security from wearing a mask and would use up supplies needed by medical professionals. New York already has a mandate for everyone to wear a face mask if they can’t stay at least 6 feet apart. New studies, however, show people can be highly infectious in the few days before they show symptoms or can catch the virus and never show symptoms. Governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments,” the director-general said. The guidance comes as transmission rates are accelerating in South America, the Middle East and Africa, CNN reported. The number of confirmed cases is climbing at a rate of more than 100,000 a day over a seven-day period, the outlet reported. The number of new cases topped 100,000 for nine of the past 10 days. In April, new cases never topped 100,000 in one day. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. As a conservative, I’m thrilled by the arrival of unified Republican government. But the politician I’m most grateful to in Washington today isn’t President Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. It’s Chuck Schumer. That’s because the Democratic Senate minority leader is doing more than anyone in our nation’s capital to ensure the passage of the most conservative health-care and tax reform possible — while working overtime to make sure that Democrats who voted for Trump in 2016 stay in the GOP fold in 2018 and beyond. The biggest fear many conservatives had after the 2016 election was that Trump would be too quick to cut deals with the Democrats. He holds heterodox positions on everything from spending, foreign policy and entitlements to the minimum wage, trade and health care. And he’s a dealmaker, not an ideologue. He would have loved nothing better than to cut deals with Schumer. Indeed, Trump reportedly called Schumer the morning after the election offering to do just that. Instead of accepting Trump’s outstretched hand, Schumer’s Democrats are opposing virtually everything that Trump does. They are attempting to block not only his Cabinet nominees but also his sub-Cabinet appointments. And they have expressed zero interest in working with him on bipartisan legislation. The battle cry of the Democratic Party is “Resist!” This unrelenting resistance has pushed Trump to the right. Since Trump knows he can’t get Democratic votes for his health and tax plans, he doesn’t need to make concessions to the left. Conservatives criticizing the Trump-Ryan health-care plan as “ObamaCare lite” should consider how much worse it would be if Schumer had decided to sit down with Trump at the bargaining table. This would have been smart policy and smart politics — allowing Schumer to sow divisions between Trump and the more conservative elements of the GOP caucus. But Democrats aren’t interested in bipartisanship. They want to destroy Trump. As a result, Schumer is passing up golden opportunities to win policy victories and divide Republicans — all in an effort to placate his Trump-deranged, far-left base. Conservatives should be thrilled. Schumer is not only pushing Trump to the right but also helping Republicans consolidate and grow their congressional majorities — by further alienating once-reliably Democratic blue-collar voters who abandoned the party in the last election. Last summer, Schumer dismissed these voters with the back of his hand, declaring that “for every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two, three moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.” It didn’t work out that way. Democrats won Illinois but lost Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and even Michigan. The Washington Post reports that of the nearly 700 counties that twice voted for Obama, “a stunning one-third flipped to support Trump” in 2016. That means there are millions of Obama voters out there who were sick of Democrats such as Schumer dismissing their concerns and decided they wanted to give Trump a chance. Now they see Democrats responding to their decision by digging in their heels and resisting and obstructing everything Trump does. The Democrats’ message to Middle America is: We don’t hear you. There could be nothing better for the GOP — and nothing worse for the 10 Democratic senators up for reelection in 2018 in red states that voted for Trump. Republicans need to pick up only eight seats to win a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, in which case they won’t need Democrats for anything. So thank you, Chuck Schumer! Let’s hope he continues to lead the resistance. Let’s hope he continues to block Trump’s agenda and forces vulnerable Senate Democrats to be Trump obstructionists. If Republicans don’t blow the opportunity, the result will be legislation that is more conservative — and expanded congressional majorities in 2018. Special to The Washington Post Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Americans are giving President Biden dismal ratings on his handling of rising crime, a new poll found. The ABC News/Washington Post poll released Friday morning revealed that just 38 percent of Americans approve of the 46th commander-in-chief’s response to recent crime spikes nationwide. On the other side, 48 percent said they disapproved. As crime rates have continued to surge, lawmakers have been quick to point fingers to avoid their party taking blame. Republicans have largely argued that Democrats’ efforts to defund the police, remove qualified immunity for police officers and introduce cashless bail have all contributed to the budding crisis. Democrats, meanwhile, have blamed guns and economic hardship following the pandemic. In New York, state officials have blamed a surge in shootings on gun trafficking from other parts of the country, largely ignoring the impact of bail reform on the state. Murders increased by about 25 percent nationwide in 2020. As of late May, New York City had 17.4 percent more murders, 73 percent more shootings and 24.9 percent more car thefts than at the same point in May 2020. The ABC/WaPo poll found that Americans were divided almost evenly on which party to trust to combat crime, with Republicans beating Democrats 36 to 35 percent, respectively. Twenty percent said that they did not trust either party to handle the issue. The poll also revealed that the number of Americans who saw crime as an extremely serious problem was at a 20-year high of 28 percent. That number expands to 59 percent when those who called it very serious — as opposed to extremely — are added to the tally. As for solutions, 75 percent of poll participants said that increasing funding for economic opportunities in poorer area would reduce crime, while 65 percent said using social workers to help police would make a difference. Fifty-five percent pointed to increasing police funding as a solution, 51 percent said stricter enforcement of current gun laws and 46 percent said stricter gun laws. Reps for President Biden did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment on the poll findings. White House press secretary Jen Psaki has repeatedly asserted in recent weeks that crime increased “18 months” ago — despite the fact that side-by-side comparisons of the first five months of 2020 and 2021 demonstrate a significant jump in murders and car thefts. Biden faces a political minefield on the issue of crime, especially ahead of the 2022 midterms. Liberal and conservative pundits alike have been warning that soaring crime could wreck Democratic political fortunes, and potentially return former President Donald Trump to the White House. Further complicating matters, Biden — once infamous for pushing or authoring laws in the 1980s and ’90s that disproportionately jailed blacks and sent some people to jail for life for marijuana — cannot risk alienating left-wing advocates who support the defund movement.

Mayor de Blasio came up with a new standard for the press on Friday — cover the stories that I tell you are important, not the ones I don’t like. During a panel discussion in Brooklyn about the media, the mayor questioned why reporters “obsessed” over the Puerto Rican Day Parade’s decision to honor former FALN leader Oscar López Rivera — a man that Hizzoner’s own police commissioner labeled a “terrorist.” And de Blasio said it was odd that he keeps getting asked why he travels 12 miles a day in a two-vehicle caravan just to exercise on a stationary bike in Park Slope, Brooklyn, instead of the Upper East Side near Gracie Mansion. “I think it’s kind of strange to obsess over a gym routine or who’s marching in a parade compared to all the things that actually affect everyday life. I just don’t get it,” the mayor said during the interview with BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith. “I think people really are interested in the stuff that affects their lives. I would urge journalists to try it.” His comments came as he’s being hammered for what he characterized as minor issues that regular folks don’t care about. He was criticized by environmental advocates for urging New Yorkers to change their everyday habits to combat climate change at the same time he refused to alter his gas-guzzling gym routine. De Blasio said for weeks he would march in the parade. But, in the face of political heat, he claimed he had been maneuvering all along behind the scenes to resolve the situation. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Christine Blasey Ford deserves a hearing, although at the moment she doesn’t seem to want one. What she doesn’t deserve is to be believed automatically because she’s a woman making an accusation. When our system of justice is at its best, it judges each individual — the accuser and the accused — fairly, on the basis of the evidence, and with an adversarial process that has proved over the centuries the best way to ascertain the truth. Ford’s charge is serious by any standard, and despite the shameful way it was handled — Dianne Feinstein sat on it for weeks, until it leaked out at the 11th hour — Republicans appropriately agreed to delay a committee vote and hear from both Ford and Kavanaugh at an open hearing. The problem is that Ford’s accusation doesn’t seem particularly provable — an alleged incident 36 years ago, with few details to check against — and the Democratic media isn’t very interested in proving it. It wants to take Ford’s truthfulness as a given, as matter of cosmic and gender equity. “I believe the survivor,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) says of Ford. It would be accurate for him to say, “I believe she is a survivor,” since we don’t know the truth of her allegation. But the point here is to take rhetorical and political advantage of her alleged victimhood before it’s been established — indeed to use her assumed victimhood to foreclose any serious questioning of whether she is a victim. What we’re seeing, in effect, is the importation of the infamous kangaroo-court apparatus for adjudicating sexual-harassment and assault cases from college campuses — which often denies the accused basic protections of due process — to the US Senate. Without having any independent knowledge of whether Ford’s account of Brett Kavanaugh allegedly attempting to rape her is true, Blumenthal is still a hanging judge: “This nomination will not only cast a shadow over Judge Kavanaugh, if he were ever to be confirmed, it will also stain the United States Supreme Court irreparably.” The court weathered Roger Taney and Dred Scott, but will be brought to ruination by Brett Kavanaugh. If we aren’t going to simply assume Kavanaugh’s guilt, we have to be willing to challenge Ford’s account, and ask questions about it. But we’re told this is risky, or even out of bounds. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) noted Ford’s fuzzy memory of key details, and concluded, “There are some gaps there that need to be filled.” Chris Cilliza of CNN deemed these kind of queries “walking a VERY dangerous line,” although they are obviously central to testing the accuracy of Ford’s account. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) pronounced, “By refusing to treat her allegations properly” — her otherworldly description of an invitation to Ford to testify in an open or closed setting — “and by playing games to protect Kavanaugh’s nomination, they’re telling women across the country that they’re not to be believed. That they are worth less than a man’s promotion.” No, that’s not what they’re telling women, or anyone else. The message is that they’ll try to find the truth before crediting an accusation. This once was a tenet of liberalism, back in the day when it celebrated the Arthur Miller play “The Crucible” and supported the old-school ACLU. Now, “liberal” means something different: braying for collective justice, regardless of the evidence, to right historic wrongs. ABC News commentator Matthew Dowd opined, “If this is ‘he said, she said,’ then let’s believe that ‘she’ in these scenarios. She has nothing to gain, and everything to lose. For 250 years we have believed the ‘he’ in these scenarios. Enough is enough.” Putting aside the tendentious history, this is a call for people to subordinate their reason and moral discernment to a social and political agenda. Not all women are to believed, whatever the past sins of the patriarchy. The Duke lacrosse players weren’t guilty. The UVA fraternity story wasn’t true. Mattress Girl, the Columbia University student who carried a mattress around as a symbol of her alleged rape, falsely accused her supposed assailant. This obviously doesn’t mean all women should be disbelieved, either. Almost all of the #MeToo allegations against high-profile figures in Hollywood and the media have been credible. It does mean accusations of sexual misconduct — like any other accusation — should be evaluated case-by-case, and on the basis of the evidence. This isn’t victimizing the accusers, it is serving the cause of justice. Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii captured the current temper of the left when she said, “I want to say to the men of this country: Shut up and just step up and do the right thing.” This says much more about her — and her own suitability for high office — than Kavanaugh. He has no obligation to shut up — even if about half his Senate audience is losing its interest in due process or fair play. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. A Brooklyn lawmaker is accusing Major League Baseball of disrespecting 9/11 first responders by refusing to allow the Mets to wear caps honoring the heroes on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks. City Councilman Justin Brannan fired off a scathing letter to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred last week demanding the league let the Mets wear caps emblazoned with “NYPD,” “FDNY” and other first-responder agencies for the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Any other teams wishing to do so should be allowed also, Brannan wrote. The Bay Ridge-based Democrat made the plea after MLB rejected the team’s latest request – made through star rookie slugger Pete Alonso — to wear the special caps during a home game last Wednesday on the 18th anniversary of 9/11. “This [MLB] decision was a real slap in the face to all the first responders who stepped up during the worst terrorist attack in the history of our nation, with many making the ultimate sacrifice, right here in the greatest city in the world where the Mets play,” Brannan wrote Manfred. “This isn’t just about New York City, it’s about America,” the pol seethed. “Baseball may be our national pastime and as American as apple pie, but this decision was anything but. Fans are angry, players are angry, and the first responders and their families feel disrespected.” Brannan, who regularly describes himself as a “long-suffering Mets fan,” asked why the league would allow the Houston Astros to wear Apollo 11 caps in July to commemorate the first moon landing 50 years ago, yet won’t allow the Sept. 11 tribute. Following the 9/11 attacks that left 2,753 dead at the World Trade Center, the Mets famously began wearing caps honoring cops, firefighters and other first responders — despite initial objections from the league — for the remainder of the 2001 season. The Mets have regularly asked MLB for permission to repeat the tribute but have been denied each time since. The latest failed bid was made directly by Alonso, who ultimately did an end-run around MLB by ordering customized 9/11-inspired cleats for his teammates. The club wore the special red, white and blue cleats — which included a silhouette of the Twin Towers and the inscription “We will never forget” – while collecting nine runs on 11 hits during a 9-0 blowout win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. MLB opted not to penalize the Mets or Alonso for breaking league dress code rules, but Brannan believes it’s ridiculous that the team even has to ask for permission to pay tribute to 9/11 heroes. When asked about Brannan’s complaint, an MLB source said the league directs teams to “honor tragedies however they want on the field” – but only during warmups and other pregame activities. “The league handles it this way so that [it isn’t] in the position of judging which tragedies should and shouldn’t be recognized during a game after a series of club requests were made,” the source said. Despite rejecting the Mets’ request, the league did observe 9/11 last Wednesday with ballparks holding a moment of silence and pregame ceremonies. Players and coaches wore team caps – but they included a special side patch featuring a red, white, and blue ribbon, a modified version of the MLB logo with a US flag, and a caption reading “September 11, 2001 WE SHALL NEVER FORGET.” This is not the first time Brannan has taken on MLB and Manfred. Incensed over MLB’s rain delay rules soaking fans’ wallets, Brannan in May wrote the commissioner urging him to implement a new policy requiring umpires to call games once delays stretch more than an hour so fans are not “lingering endlessly.” Manfred brushed back the pol’s pitch by telling him the proposal is “impractical.” Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. In his new book, “Guilty As Sin” (Regnery), out Tuesday, Edward Klein claims officials in the Obama administration decided before the first witness was interviewed that Hillary Clinton would not face prosecution over the handling of classified email. An excerpt: Bill Clinton’s private jet was cleared for takeoff and was taxiing toward the active runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport when a Secret Service agent informed him that Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s plane was coming in for a landing. “Don’t take off!” Bill barked. As his plane skidded to a halt and then headed back to its parking space, Bill grabbed a phone and called an old friend — one of his most trusted legal advisers. It was June 27, 2016 — one year into the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails. “Bill said, ‘I want to bushwhack Loretta,’ ” the adviser recalled. “ ‘I’m going to board her plane. What do you think?’ And I said, ‘There’s no downside for you, but she’s going to take a pounding if she’s crazy enough to let you on her plane.’ “He knew it would be a huge embarrassment to Loretta when people found out that she had talked to the husband of a woman — the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party — who was under criminal investigation by the FBI,” the adviser continued. “But he didn’t give a damn. He wanted to intimidate Loretta and discredit [FBI Director James] Comey’s investigation of Hillary’s emails, which was giving Hillary’s campaign agita.” Bill hung up the phone and turned to a Secret Service agent. “As soon as her plane lands,” he said, “get the attorney general on the phone and say the president would like to have a word with her.” Once inside Lynch’s plane, Bill turned on the Clinton charm. He gave Lynch’s shoulder an affectionate squeeze and shook hands with her husband, Stephen Hargove. “Bill said he could tell that Loretta knew from the get-go that she’d made a huge mistake,” his adviser said. “She was literally trembling, shaking with nervousness. Her husband tried to comfort her; he kept patting her hand and rubbing her back. “Bill made small talk about golf and grandchildren and [former Attorney General] Janet Reno, and he kept at it for nearly a half-hour. It didn’t make any difference what they talked about; all he wanted to do was send a message to everyone at Justice and the FBI that Hillary had the full weight of the Clinton machine, the Democratic Party, and the White House behind her. “It was clearly tortuous for Loretta. Bill told me later that he noticed there were beads of sweat on her upper lip.” One week later, Barack Obama invited Hillary to fly with him to North Carolina for a campaign rally. He wouldn’t have let her use two of the greatest symbols of presidential power — Air Force One and the podium with the Seal of the President of the United States — if he thought there was even the slightest chance she was going to be indicted. But Attorney General Lynch had privately assured him that she wouldn’t let that happen, and that the fix was in. Many members of the mainstream media thought that FBI Director Comey was hell-bent on indicting Hillary. They called him the Eliot Ness of his time — squeaky clean and untouchable. But that was a complete misreading of Comey. He was affable, had a good sense of humor, and might come across as a straight arrow, but he didn’t get to be director of the FBI by falling off the turnip truck. It took huge ambition and an instinct for political survival. Comey knew that if he recommended an indictment of Hillary — something that was fiercely opposed by the president, the attorney general, the Democrats in Congress, and the mainstream media — he’d ignite a firestorm and go down in history as the man who traumatized the country’s political system. What’s more, if after all of that, Hillary was found not guilty by a jury, it would blacken Comey’s reputation for all time to come. The day after Obama and Hillary flew to North Carolina, Comey held a televised press conference in the FBI auditorium. Dressed in a blue shirt and gold tie, which matched the colors of the FBI flag standing behind his lectern, Comey methodically laid out a bill of indictment against Hillary Clinton. He said that Hillary and her top aides at the State Department — Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, and Jake Sullivan — had been “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” On and on he went, for a full 10 minutes, making an iron-clad case that Hillary was guilty of gross negligence in her handling of classified material, and that she had violated a federal statute that did not require evidence of intent to prove her guilty. Attorney General Lynch sat in her office, along with her top aides, watching Comey deliver his blistering rebuke of Hillary Clinton. Lynch had promised President Obama and Valerie Jarrett that Hillary would not be indicted. But here was the director of the FBI on national TV laying out what appeared to be an unassailable case for prosecuting her. How could this have happened? What had gone wrong? Would she be forced to resign? All these thoughts went through Lynch’s mind, as she later recalled to a friend, as she listened to Comey drone on. She was livid. Finally, she couldn’t stand to watch him anymore. She covered her eyes with her hands and let out a string of curses aimed at Jim Comey. And then, three-quarters of the way through his news conference, Comey dropped a bombshell. Hillary, he said, shouldn’t be prosecuted for her handling of classified information — even though it wasn’t his job to make prosecutorial decisions. That was up to the prosecutors in the Justice Department. There was no evidence, he said, that Hillary had intentionally transmitted or willfully mishandled secret documents in order to harm the United States. “Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.” Hillary was clearly guilty as sin, and the right thing would have been for Comey not only to say so — which he did — but to make her pay for her sins. But he didn’t. Share Selection",

WASHINGTON — Actress Anne Hathaway told an audience Saturday night that she’s been frightened by the hatred of LGBT people that bigots spew — but a speech by former Vice President Joe Biden went a long way to restoring her faith. “I really needed this,” Hathaway said as she accepted the National Equality Award at the Human Rights Campaign’s National Dinner. “I think I’m probably walking around like most people right now. I’m pretty shell-shocked by what I see every day, what I hear every day. And I really don’t like to admit this, but I get scared.” Hathaway said she felt better after hearing speeches from Biden and HRC president Chad Griffin, who spoke earlier in the evening. “You guys just gave me my heart back,” Hathaway gushed. Then, speaking to the ladies, gentlemen and “gentlethem” in the crowd, Hathaway denounced white, straight and cisgender privilege. “It is important to acknowledge with the exception of being a cisgender male, everything about how I was born has put me at the current center of a damaging and widely accepted myth,” she said. “That myth is that gayness orbits around straightness, transgender orbits around cisgender, and that all races orbit around whiteness.” Hathaway explained that it was when she spent time with the LGBTQ community — her older brother is gay — that she learned to reject this myth. “I appreciate this community because together we are not going to just question this myth, we are going to destroy it,” she told the crowd. “Let’s tear this world apart and build a better one.” Hathaway was introduced by her “Ocean’s 8” co-star Awkwafina, who called the Academy Award-winning actress a “friend and sister.” “But let’s be clear, she’s been telegraphing to the queer community for years,” the rapper and actress said of Hathaway. “Like when she straddled that motorcycle in that spray-on jumpsuit as Catwoman.” “I’m shivering right now,” Awkwafina said to laughs.

Last week, The Post revealed how New Yorkers on welfare are buying food with their benefit cards and shipping it in blue barrels to poor relatives in the Caribbean. But not everyone is giving the taxpayer-funded fare to starving children abroad. The Post last week found two people hawking barrels of American products for a profit on the streets of Santiago. “It’s a really easy way to make money, and it doesn’t cost me anything,” a seller named Maria-Teresa said Friday. The 47-year-old Bronx native told The Post she scalps barrels of Frosted Flakes and baby formula bought with welfare money in the United States. Maria-Teresa said she gets new barrels every few weeks from her sister, who buys everything at a Western Beef on Prospect Avenue near East 165th Street in Foxhurst. The scamming sibling pays $75 per barrel to transport the items to the DR through Mott Haven’s Luciano Shipping. Sometimes the family fraudsters take advantage of a special: three barrels for the price of two. Maria-Teresa said she uses some of the products but vends the rest out of her Santiago home, providing markdowns of $1 to $2 compared to what her buyers would pay in local shops. “I don’t know how much of a business it is, but I know a lot of people are doing it,” she said. CARIB CONNECTION: A man named Jean in the Dominican city of Santiago last week sells a barrel shipped from NYC and stuffed with welfare food — part of a thriving black market. (Jose Ernesto Devarez) CARIB CONNECTION: A man named Jean in the Dominican city of Santiago last week sells a barrel shipped from NYC and stuffed with welfare food — part of a thriving black market. ( ) The black-market maven even takes her customers’ requests for hot-ticket items. Her best-sellers include a 19-ounce box of Frosted Flakes, which goes for $6.50 at Dominican supermarkets. She sells it for $2 less — after her sister buys it on sale for $2.99. But because the sister uses her Electronic Benefit Transfer card, she actually pays nothing — taxpayers foot the $2.99. Maria-Teresa also offers a 24-ounce Kellogg’s Corn Flakes box for $2, compared to the $4 Dominican counterpart. The Kellogg’s variety costs $2.99 on sale at Western Beef. A 23-ounce container of powdered Enfamil baby formula goes for $25 in the United States and $19 in Santiago but Maria-Teresa sells it for $15. “People want the best quality for the price, so they buy the formula made in the US,” she said. The average monthly wage in Dominican Republic is about 7,000 pesos, or just $167, and that’s why the black market has become so profitable, Maria-Teresa said. And the food-stamp fraud doesn’t stop there. She said her sister has Bronx grocers ring up bogus $250 transactions with her EBT card. In exchange, the stores hand her $200 cash and pocket the rest. No goods are exchanged. Instead, Maria-Teresa’s sister sends the money to Santiago — when she’s not spending it on liquor or other nonfood items. “We do it all the time, and a lot of people do this,” Maria-Teresa said. “It’s a way of laundering money, but it’s easier because it’s free.” Jean, another public-assistance cheat in Santiago, told The Post he has peddled welfare food in Santiago since getting deported from New York in 2010. A thirtysomething Haitian national, he said his sister in Queens uses her EBT card to purchase food before shipping it to him from Long Island City. “Every other month, I receive the barrels from my sister in New York City,” he told The Post. “Whatever I don’t need, I sell. “My sister uses food stamps to buy most of the things she sends me,” Jean added. He says the barrels are filled with cereal, baby formula, juices, olive oil and canned soup. He said his sister uses Long Island City’s Santiago Cargo Express, where barrels full of food cost $100 to ship to the DR. When The Post found Jean, he was lugging an empty barrel down the street and hoping to sell it to a friend for $35. Many Dominicans then use the containers to store water for their homes.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. It’s expected that Donald Trump’s former Republican rival Ted Cruz would use his primetime speaking slot at the GOP convention to serve his own ambitions, just as it’s expected that liberals and the anti-Trump crowd alike would love every moment of it. Up until Wednesday, when Cruz used his speech to slight Trump and decline to endorse him for president, the Texas senator was hated by the media and the political class. Or more broadly, most everyone who has ever heard him speak. But because Cruz attempted to embarrass Trump on national television, he’s very suddenly a new kind of hero. Writing in the liberal New York magazine, Andrew Sullivan, the biggest snob who ever blogged, said he was “proud” of Cruz for having “stared the bully down.” Sullivan’s pronouncement of Cruz as a patriot to his country comes two years after having called him “a world-class meshuggenah asshole.” Other than being a minor annoyance for Trump, Cruz’s speech was wholly unremarkable, platitudes delivered in his typical male-lead-in-a-high-school-play style. He held out endorsing Trump, clearly still bitter about having been handily rejected by Republicans in the primaries. As his speech dragged on through 20 minutes, the New York delegation jeered, either out of boredom or having noticed that Trump’s name had hardly come up. Cruz, always condescending, said he appreciated their “enthusiasm.” The only surprise from the moment is that Trump let him speak at all, given his knack for showbiz. Watching Cruz give a speech is about as delightful as dysentery. Even Charles Krauthammer, who does not support Trump, said the next day that Cruz “crossed the boundary of simple elementary manners.” But the media liked that he had done something tasteless to the Republican nominee. “Cruz’s remarks were a striking rebuke of the nominee and can only be viewed as a major embarrassment for Trump,” said a gleeful writeup at the liberal Web site Vox. The Texas senator was a less impressive figure three months ago in April, when Vox accused Cruz of “scaremongering” over the transgender-bathroom controversy that had just become a national issue. “Ted Cruz humiliates Donald Trump…” blared a headline at the Daily Beast. Back in September, Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin hit Cruz’s “exaggerated, artificial speaking style.” But on Thursday, she heralded his speech as “arguably the most consequential convention speech of any non-winner since Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) delivered “The dream will never die.” In September, she described Cruz as “ideologically erratic.” After the convention speech, she said Cruz had “reminded his followers of his devotion to principles.” You would think Cruz had done something really impressive and leapt from the stage to clothesline Trump across the throat instead of having just passive aggressively told the audience to “vote your conscience.” It was worthy of an eye roll but liberals and the news media celebrated it as an upending of the nomination process. Cruz is a hero because he’s serving the media’s purpose. But If he was the nominee, the people who think he’s so principled now would be would be dousing him in gasoline instead of showering him with kisses.

        "articles": "Submit Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. All the political talk of tackling inequality should warm the hearts of Jets fans. After next month’s game in the Meadowlands, it will be 45 years since the team won the Super Bowl, a measure of inequality that cries out for justice. Oh, the unfairness! There are 32 NFL teams, so, in a utopian world, each team would win the championship once every 32 years. But the Jets haven’t won it since 1969 — where have you gone, Joe Namath? Some other teams, including the hated Patriots, are greedy fat cats who win more than their fair share. There oughta be a law against that. Actually, there is. The NFL, in a quest for socialist-like “parity,” enforces rules that aim to produce equal results. The worst teams get to draft the best college players. All teams equally share the biggest pot of revenues. A salary cap equally limits payrolls. And each year’s schedule gives weaker teams weaker ­opponents. But justice, as measured by Super Bowl victories, has been ­denied. Maybe Bill de Blasio will require that Tom Brady play for the Jets? Maybe Barack Obama could issue an executive order that gives them extra points? OK, I jest, but only a little. For while radical Democrats stoke ­social-justice tempers by focusing on income inequality, the sports pages offer a daily — and delicious — menu of stubborn inequality. Indeed, differences in quality are the whole point of sports. And also in music and dance and plumbers and car mechanics and everything else that matters. Would you go to a brain surgeon who flunked out of med school? Merit and skill deserve to be highly compensated. Karl Marx notwithstanding, there always are winners and losers. No system anywhere has succeeded in guaranteeing equal outcomes, including the “everybody gets a trophy” movement among social busybodies. The societies with the flattest outcomes, according to studies, are Fidel Castro’s Cuba, where everybody except the ruling elite is desperately poor, and North Korea, for the same reason. America is different, thank God. It was founded to ensure the individual’s right to pursue happiness, and guided by the spirit to cushion the blow of those who don’t find it. Our country, by constantly evolving, finds the balance better than any society in history, and New York is first among cities in offering equal ­opportunity to all comers. Yet we are now plagued by false prophets — Obama and de Blasio being prime examples — who make a career out of denying these facts. They would have us believe that unequal outcomes ­always result from injustice. They insist they only want equal opportunity, but point to unequal results as proof the game was rigged. They suggest the poor are poor because the rich are rich. The unstated assumption is that everybody should and can be equally rich, or poor, or handsome or successful. New York’s new comptroller, Scott Stringer, promised to put “shared prosperity above individual success.” Good luck, comrade. The most optimistic way to view this “pink tide” washing over us is to realize it is doomed to fail. Whether it’s ObamaCare or de Blasio’s claim that “our mission” is to end a “tale of two cities,” extreme redistribution schemes eventually collapse. They never succeed because they conflict with human DNA. Unfortunately, they often do tremendous damage before they perish. Taking liberty from individuals and concentrating power in the hands of bureaucrats inevitably results in stunted growth, lost opportunity and human misery. The powder keg grows as freedom is squashed. That is the consequence of false prophets, even when they have good intentions. Out of ignorance and arrogance, they do more harm than good. Meanwhile, the Jets, like all people everywhere, must keep striving. They might never win ­another Super Bowl, but that’s life, and there’s nothing inherently unfair about unequal results. Each time I see a story about another John Kerry fixation, I know that somewhere, a village is missing its idiot. Our secretary of state’s quixotic idea of what he should be doing would be admirable if he weren’t so off base and largely irrelevant. While he fiddles, the world burns. Kerry’s latest detour from reality is a focus on climate change. He does that when he’s not pressuring the Israelis and Palestinians to make a deal that neither side wants. All the while, he ignores real hot spots. Al Qaeda groups took over parts of two Iraqi cities and Syria missed a deadline for transferring chemical weapons out of the country. Hezbollah is upgrading its missile stockpile and bombs are exploding in Beirut. Japan and China are escalating their rhetoric over disputed islands. Iran increases its uranium enrichment, Russia expands and Egypt staggers. The list goes on, but Kerry isn’t paying attention. He’s got his story and he’s sticking to it. His reputation for being self-centered is legendary, even by Washington standards. A senator told me that a popular joke had it that Kerry’s initials — JFK — stood for “Just For Kerry.” Nothing’s changed, except now he’s got a much more important job he’s not doing. This can’t end well. Readers were outraged at the shabby treatment of Mayor Bloomberg at his successor’s inauguration. Many emphasized that they didn’t always agree with Bloomy, but believed he deserved better because he served the city honestly and left it in better shape than he found it. “I fear for our great city,” Gilly Safdeye wrote. “Appreciation and good manners seem to be anathema to our new mayor.” Pamela Mullen put it this way: “Didn’t anyone in this new administration play team sports as a kid? You never leave the field without shaking the hands of the opposing team.” Len Resto included a brief passage he wanted de Blasio to say, starting with: “First, I join the entire city in thanking Mayor Bloomberg for his enormous contributions in steering our city through one of its most challenging times and leaving me a with a budget in surplus, city agencies which are fully functional and for a quality of life which is better today than when he took office. Mr. Mayor, thank you!” It would have taken only a few seconds and, Resto says, would have changed the tone of the day. I agree, but de Blasio doesn’t. Asked later about the ungracious attacks, the new mayor said: “Everyone who spoke at the inauguration spoke from the heart . . . I’m very comfortable with all that was done.” There you have the new mayor’s standard. As long as you speak “from the heart,” nothing else matters, including facts and manners. I trust de Blasio will support that same standard when his critics speak from their hearts. You can’t blame the Gray Lady for feeling jilted. Reports say the White House is spending millions on advertisements to showcase “positive experiences” with ObamaCare. Such betrayal! Propaganda is the Times’ job. Share Selection",

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. The Amtrak crash outside of Philadelphia was an invitation for practically every politician in the Northeast and every transit expert in America to complain about lack of funding for the county’s infrastructure. They didn’t even wait to know what was the cause of the tragedy to take to the airwaves, and weren’t deterred when it emerged that the engineer had been going twice the speed limit around a tight curve when Amtrak Train 188 derailed. They cared only for reciting the usual litany of laments for our “crumbling” infrastructure and our lack of high-speed rail, which is supposedly a stinging indictment of our shortsightedness and barbarity compared with our betters in Europe and Japan. What these advocates rarely do is take account of Amtrak as it actually exists. It is a test case of a highly subsidized (and politicized) rail system. Hideously inefficient and wasteful, Amtrak is rail brought to you by the federal government, with the results about what you would expect. Amtrak is the DMV in an Uber world. The system was slated for profitability in the 1970s, after a brief period of public subsidy. Not surprisingly, the profitability has never come, and the subsidy has never ended. All told, the taxpayers pour about $1 billion into it a year. Amtrak’s unionized employees made on average more than $90,000 a year in wages and benefits as of a couple of years ago. Outside of the Northeast and a few other places, it serves uneconomical routes that account for the bulk of its losses (although Congress insists on those routes for political reasons). Amtrak can’t even sell food and drink to a captive audience at a profit. It loses $80 million a year on its food service, perhaps as much as $7 million of that lost to simple theft. If Amtrak is the future of American transit, then American transit has no future. Yet visions of high-speed rail dance in the heads of liberal rail enthusiasts, who believe that what we need is Amtrak, only more so. President Obama is a devotee, urging on the country to match the high-speed rails of Europe and Asia and backing his vision with billions in federal dollars. The problem with high-speed rail in this country is that few places outside the Northeast have the population density to support it, so the economics don’t work. Ridership won’t come close to recouping the massive capital expenditures involved, which is a formula for endless Amtrak-like subsidies. High-speed rail is one thing in a densely populated Japan; it is another thing altogether in the sprawling continental United States. Although it’s not as glamorous, we already have an extensive transit system that can take people door to door pretty much anyplace they want to go — i.e., roads. If people don’t want to drive themselves between cities, they have the option of buses, which are cheaper than trains even if they don’t have the same romance. And, of course, airplanes are faster than trains. Randal O’Toole of the libertarian Cato Institute points out that the travel patterns of Americans don’t support the soaring ambitions of the passenger-rail enthusiasts. As of 2012, highways accounted for 87 percent of passenger travel and airlines 12 percent, but Amtrak only .14 percent. It is a rounding error on American transportation. It’s not as though the country can’t do rail. It’s just that we are good at moving goods rather than people. Our freight-rail system is world-class. Deregulated by the 1980 Staggers Rail Act, the freight sector has benefited from abundant private investment. Cheap and efficient, freight rail is doing booming business. No one brags about freight rail, though, because it lacks the appeal of grandiose public infrastructure projects and doesn’t entail envy of France. Amtrak may be many things, but it is emphatically not an argument for more government investment in passenger rail. Share Selection",

The head of the World Health Organization insisted Friday that scientists haven’t ruled out the possibility that COVID-19 was leaked from a lab in China — despite previous declarations from a WHO-led team saying it was “extremely unlikely.” In a swift about-face, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the theory that the virus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology has not been dismissed, and that the organization is still investigating. “Some questions have been raised as to whether some hypotheses have been discarded,” Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva. “Having spoken with some members of the team, I wish to confirm that all hypotheses remain open and require further analysis and studies.” His comments come after Peter Ben Embarek — an animal diseases expert on the WHO-led team that investigated the origins of the pandemic in the Chinese city — insisted earlier this week that the theory was far-fetched. “The findings suggest that the laboratory incidents hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus to the human population,” Embarek said. However, some potential findings may lie outside the “scope” of the WHO-led team’s investigation, Ghebreyesus explained Friday. “Some of that work may lie outside the remit and scope of this mission. We have always said that this mission would not find all the answers, but it has added important information that takes us closer to understanding the origins of the virus,” he said. “We will continue working to get the information we need to answer the questions that still need to be answered.” The Trump administration previously pointed fingers at the Wuhan lab, saying the virus may have escaped while it was being studied there. China, meanwhile, has remained defiant that COVID-19 was never present at the lab. More than 108 million confirmed cases have now been reported globally since the virus emerged and more than 2.3 million people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

        "articles": "Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Brexit was finally passed into law Thursday with royal assent from Queen Elizabeth II — leaving the UK set to finally leave the Europen Union next week after almost four years of bitter debate. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans sparked cheers of “Hear! Hear!” in the House of Commons on Thursday afternoon when he announced that the Withdrawal Agreement Act had been signed off on by the Queen. It was its last obstacle in the UK, with it now up to EU leaders to formally ratify the law in a vote next Wednesday for Britain to leave the bloc on schedule on Friday next week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson — who staked his leadership on getting Brexit through — was understandably jubilant. “At times, it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we’ve done it,” he said Thursday. It is not expected to face any obstacles when the bloc votes next week. The EU Parliament’s constitutional affairs committee voted by a large margin Thursday to approve the Brexit withdrawal deal, preparing the way for a vote of all European lawmakers in Brussels next Wednesday. “It’s a historical moment, albeit a somber moment, for us. We deeply regret this outcome,” committee chair Antonio Tajani said after the 23-3 vote. It ends a yearslong battle to get Brexit approved — but still leaves deep divisions in the UK. After the royal assent was announced, Scottish National Party lawmaker Ian Blackford said the UK was in a “constitutional crisis” because the legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland did not back the Brexit bill. “Boris Johnson has trampled over the democratic votes in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff,” Blackford fumed. Once the EU Parliament ratifies Brexit, the UK and the EU will begin negotiating in February to work out their future ties. The negotiations are expected to deliver new relationships for trade, security and other policy issues by the end of 2020. The UK also plans to negotiate a trade deal with the US. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, speaking Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, sounded optimistic such a deal would get done. “Both are very heavily services oriented and within services, such as financial services, there’s already a pretty high degree of integration and coordination, so it should be much easier mechanically,” he said.

This guy is either the dumbest Ivy League bigwig ever or politically correct to a fault — for welcoming offers to bring ISIS and Hamas to Cornell University. A video sting operation shows Cornell’s assistant dean for students, Joseph Scaffido, agreeing to everything suggested by an undercover muckraker posing as a Moroccan student. Scaffido casually endorses inviting an ISIS “freedom fighter’’ to conduct a “training camp” for students at the upstate Ithaca campus — bizarrely likening the activity to a sports camp. Is it OK to bring a humanitarian pro-“Islamic State Iraq and Syria” group on campus, the undercover for conservative activist James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas asks. Sure, Scaffido says in the recorded March 16 meeting. Scaffido doesn’t even blink an eye when the undercover asks about providing material support for terrorists — “care packages, whether it be food, water, electronics.” How about supporting Hamas? No problem at all, Scaffido said. “The university is not going to look at different groups and say, ‘You’re not allowed to support that group because we don’t believe them’ or something like that. I think it’s just the opposite. I think the university wants the entire community to understand what’s going on in all parts of the world,” Scaffido said. The undercover asked if he can invite “a freedom fighter to come and do like a training camp for students.” Scaffido responds, “You would be allowed to do something like that. It’s just like bringing in a coach, to do a training, a sports trainer or something,” the Cornell official said. The State Department includes both ISIS and Hamas on its list of terrorist organizations. Cornell brass responded to a Post inquiry made to Scaffido. “Cornell fully supports the free exchange of ideas and does not review or control the political ideology of our students. We do not, of course, tolerate unlawful advocacy of violence, and the comment about training by ISIS freedom fighters does not reflect university policy,” said Joel Malina, Cornell’s vice president for university relations.

President Trump blasted former Defense Secretary James Mattis Wednesday night, saying he had the “honor” of firing him hours after the general accused the president of abusing his power. Trump lodged his attack a Mattis in a series of tweets at about 9 p.m., calling him “the world’s most overrated General.” “Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General,” Trump wrote in the first tweet. “I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about it.” “His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations,” Trump added in a second tweet. “I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom ‘brought home the bacon’. I didn’t like his ‘leadership’ style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!” he wrote. In an op-ed in The Atlantic published hours earlier, Mattis accused Trump of actively trying to divide the country and abusing his power. “Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try,” Mattis wrote in the op-ed. “Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership,” he added. Share Selection",
