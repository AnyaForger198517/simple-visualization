        "articles": "Rand Paul’s wife, Dr. Kelley Paul, eviscerated the media and the neighbor who attacked her husband in an opinion piece for CNN. Senator Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, was the victim of a vicious attack on November 3rd. His neighbor reportedly tackled him from behind and left him with six broken ribs, three displaced ribs, a pleural effusion, and pneumonia. Kelley writes in CNN that since the attack, her husband has not taken a single breath without pain. “As his wife, I have been distraught over seeing him suffer like this,” she says. “There have been several nights where I had my hand on my phone ready to call 911 when his breathing became so labored it was terrifying.” Sen. Paul’s neighbor, Rene Albert Boucher, has plead not guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge and his attorney has continued to argue that the attack was the result of a “long-running disagreement” over yard maintenance. Kelley Paul slammed speculation by the media that the attack was over a trivial neighborly dispute involving things like lawn trimmings or gardening. One article in The New Yorker suggested the attack could be blamed on a rank smell coming from some gourds in Sen. Paul’s yard. “It is incredibly hurtful that some news outlets have victimized Rand a second time as he struggles to recover, delighting in hateful headlines like ‘Not A Perfect Neighbor,’ and concocting theories about an ‘ongoing dispute,’ based on nothing more than speculation from an attention-seeking person with no knowledge of anything to do with us,” Kelley asserts. Kelley explains that she and her husband have not spoken to the neighbor in ten years beyond a polite wave. “The only ‘dispute’ existed solely in the attacker’s troubled mind,” she says. She continues, “This has been a terrible experience; made worse by the media’s gleeful attempts to blame Rand for it, ridiculing him for everything from mowing his own lawn to composting.” Kelley Paul ends her piece by regretting that Sen. Paul will be unable to partake in their usual Thanksgiving traditions of golf and touch football, but gives thanks to her “supportive family” and the “encouragement and prayers of hundreds of kind and thoughtful people.” Follow Amber on Twitter Follow Amber on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "The American Indian leader spearheading the campaign to change the name of the Washington Redskins is not a legitimate member of the tribe he leads, according to a New York State Assemblywoman, but rather an Obama crony who is raking in casino money and paying back only small stipends to his tribe members. Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter, who is also the CEO of Oneida Nation Enterprises, is not recognized in his position by the Grand Council of Chiefs governing the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy. Halbritter is not a legitimate member of the Oneida tribe, Assemblywoman Claudia Tenney told The Daily Caller. “He is not even technically an Oneida. There is not a drop of Oneida in him,” Tenney said. Halbritter traces his lineage back to a woman who lived on traditional Iroquois Confederacy land, but as a non-member of the Six Nations. A microcopy of 1885-1940 Indian Census Rolls from the National Archives of the United States, obtained by The Daily Caller, disputes Halbritter’s claim to have one-fourth Oneida blood on his mother’s side. The Oneida Indian Nation of New York determines membership by matrilineal descent and requires “a blood quantum of 1/4 degree,” according to its constitution, submitted to a former official of the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1994. The document lists Lucy Carpenter, Halbitter’s great-great grandmother on the “Census of Indians residing upon the Oneida Reservation who do not belong to the Six Nations.” Many Indians whose families left New York attempted to get back into the Six Nations during this period to take advantage of various treaties. Lucy Carpenter’s daughter Christina Cornelius, born in Canada, had a daughter in New York named Mary Cornelius, who later married and changed her name to “Mary Winder” and had a daughter in New York named Gloria Winder, who went on to have a son with a man named “Ramon Halbritter.” That son was Arthur “Ray” Halbritter, the current Representative of the Oneida Nation, according to documents obtained by TheDC. Halbritter ancestor Lucy Carpenter’s expulsion from the Six Nations, according to the 1885-1940 Census Rolls, invalidates Halbritter’s claim to one-fourth Oneida heritage on his mother’s side, according to Tenney. “He has no ancestry in the Six Nations but he has a lot of powerful friends in D.C.,” Tenney said. Halbritter attended a January 27, 2012 fundraiser with President Obama in Washington, D.C. with 70 Indian leaders. The $15,000 to $35,800 fundraiser raised up to $2.5 million for Obama’s re-election campaign. “The president was most gracious and kind in his remarks,” Halbritter said after the event to a media network owned by his nation’s company, noting that Obama is doing more to reach out to Indian tribes than any president in his experience. Obama recently said that if he was the owner of the Redskins, he would “think about changing it [the team name].” Halbritter also faces criticism about his relatively miniscule payments to members of his nation, in light of his company’s massive casino profits. The Oneida Nation turned a $115 million profit in 2006, according to a report by University of Rochester professor Gregg Jarrell. Tenney claimed that Oneida annual revenue is now “really closer to $300 million.” The tribe directly takes in “$8 to 9 million” per year in taxpayer money from federal and state governments for health care, according to Tenney. But Oneida tribe members, who number between 450 and approximately 1,000 according to competing estimates, are only getting paid $4,000 per quarter, or $16,000 per year, according to a source. By contrast, the Seminole tribe in Florida takes in approximately $500 million in revenue and pays its approximately 3,300 members about $84,000 per year, a considerably higher rate than in Halbritter’s Oneida Nation. When a tribe member told Halbritter that the nation needed assistance and questioned the “validity” of building an RV park and a hotel, Halbritter replied, “It is your decision. If you all want to split the money and distribute it then, that can be done. As a result though, we will have no future business adventures, or new buildings built,” according to April 17, 1994 Turtle Clan Meeting minutes obtained by TheDC. Halbritter‘s pro-gambling, profit-driven mentality has been a divisive presence in his own tribe for decades. Originally appointed by his aunt, wolf clan mother Maisie Shenandoah, as one of three temporary Oneida representatives to the Grand Council of Chiefs in the 1980s, Halbritter eventually became the sole representative following the deaths of his two counterparts. Halbritter’s gaming compact with then-New York governor Mario Cuomo in 1993, which allowed for the opening of the profitable Turning Stone Casino in Verona, was not voted on by Oneida members, some of whom feel that gambling is a violation of traditional Iroquois Confederacy law. In 1993, the Grand Council of Chiefs of the Six Nation Confederacy removed Halbritter from his position as Oneida representative, but the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which initially upheld the decision, changed course and re-instated Halbritter after coaxing from then-U.S. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, who backed Indian casino development in his New York home district. Boehlert, a Republican, leveraged his political capital to get Halbritter that recognition by holding out on his vote regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) supported by then-President Clinton, records reveal. “‘A good case’ could be made that timing of Federal recognition of Ray Halbritter as representative for the Oneida Nation just days before was related to his holding out on NAFTA, he said,” according to a November 7, 1997 article on Boehlert in the “Rome Daily Sentinel.” Halbritter’s status as Representative is still not recognized by the Grand Council of Chiefs. Conflict within the Oneida tribe only grew worse in subsequent years. In 2002, Maisie Shenandoah reportedly accused her nephew Halbritter of “operating under self-assumed authority.” The following year, Halbritter’s government ordered home evictions of dwellers on Oneida Nation land, including his own aunt Maisie. Maisie Shenandoah’s daughter Diane called her mother’s eviction “a disgrace.” The Oneida Indian Nation did not return a request for comment.

        "articles": "[Alex Wong/Getty Images] Hillary Clinton deleted a 2009 email in which she forwarded classified information to her daughter, Chelsea. The email was released on Friday by the State Department. It is one of thousands of documents recovered by the FBI from Clinton’s private email server. The Dec. 20, 2009 email chain, entitled “Update,” started with a message from Michael Froman, who served as a deputy assistant to President Obama and deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs. The email, which is redacted because it contains information classified as “Confidential,” was sent to Jake Sullivan, Clinton’s foreign policy adivser at the State Department, and several Obama aides. Sullivan sent it to Hillary Clinton who then forwarded it to Chelsea, who emailed under the pseudonym “Diane Reynolds.” From the State Department The entire text of the classified email is redacted because it contains foreign government information. [dcquiz] The State Department labeled the email a “near duplicate,” indicating that it was mostly similar to other emails that the agency has released from the trove of documents that Clinton turned over in Dec. 2014. Clinton did not delete other responses she made to others on the email thread. “Wow — you can’t make this up — sorry to have missed all of that! Let me know if you learn anything else,” she wrote to Sullivan. The State Department released that portion of the email conversation in February. But perhaps the most significant part of the email is that Clinton forwarded classified information to her daughter, who is and was a private citizen with no government role and no apparent security clearances. It is unclear when or why Clinton deleted the email. She gave the State Department around 30,000 emails she claimed were related to her State Department work. She deleted a similar number claiming they were personal and dealt with yoga routines, food recipes and Chelsea’s wedding. FBI director James Comey said in July that investigators recovered several thousand work-related emails from Clinton’s server. The batch of emails released Friday are from that recovered trove.

        "articles": "It’s not an endorsement Barack Obama probably expected — or wanted — but Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol gave the president high marks for his recent foreign policy gestures. In his “You’ve come a long way, baby” post Monday night, Kristol praised Obama for his address to the American people about the action he took against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. On Wednesday’s “Red Eye” on the Fox News Channel, Kristol took things a step further and declared Obama “a born-again neo-con.” Host Greg Gutfeld asked Kristol how he felt about Obama coming to him for help (reportedly the president had met with him and others prior to his Monday night address). “He didn’t come to me for help, of course,” Kristol said. “I’m not going to acknowledge that. He came to me to make sure I was supporting his sound policies. Of course, since his sound policies are more like the policies people like me have been advocating for quite a while, I’m happy to support them. He’s a born-again neo-con.” Throughout 2007 and 2008 in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Obama ran as the anti-war candidate. But Obama has taken on different stripes with this gesture, Kristol joked. “What’s the joke – they told me if I voted for McCain, we’d be going to war in a third Muslim country?” Kristol said. “I voted for McCain and we’re doing it.” Watch: The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "(PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP via Getty Images) The Department of Homeland Security plans to replace resigning Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Matthew Albence with Tony Pham, a former Vietnamese refugee and the agency’s current Principal Legal Advisor. The Washington Examiner first reported on the personnel decision Tuesday afternoon, which the Daily Caller confirmed later in the day after obtaining the notification the department’s second-ranked official, Ken Cuccinelli, is sending to the entire staff on Pham’s promotion.

He graduated from the University of Richmond’s law school in 1999. The Pham announcement comes on the same day that President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf to serve in a permanent capacity. “I am pleased to inform the American Public that Acting Secretary Chad Wolf will be nominated to be the Secretary of Homeland Security,” Trump tweeted. “Chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service!” I am pleased to inform the American Public that Acting Secretary Chad Wolf will be nominated to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. Chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2020 A recent Government Accountability Office report claimed that both Wolf and Cuccinelli were currently serving in an illegal capacity, yet DHS officials told Daily Caller that the department plans to fight the report’s referrals to Congress and the DHS inspector general.

        "articles": "A national organization of black Republicans is calling for the impeachment of President Barack Obama. The National Black Republican Association (NBRA) originally filed articles of impeachment against the president earlier this week, citing Obama’s “attack on liberty and commission of egregious acts of despotism that constitute high crimes and misdemeanors.” The group invoked the Declaration of Independence against the president, accusing him of a “long train of abuses and usurpations.” “We must fight back against tyranny or we will lose our precious freedoms and we will find ourselves living in a socialist nation under the rule of despots like in Russia, China, North Korea and Cuba,” NBRA chair Frances Rice told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Rice’s organization says that the IRS’ scrutiny of tea party and conservative non-profits is a reason for impeachment. The NBRA’s articles also state the president “has covered up, delayed, impeded and obstructed the investigation of the Benghazi Battle.” “Brave Americans were left to die without any rescue effort taken whatsoever.” As a military veteran herself, Rice felt strongly about the creed “never leave a soldier behind,” Rice said to TheDCNF. The National Security Agency’s surveillance program is another reason the black Republican group thinks the president should be removed. Rice acknowledges that impeachment “is not quite possible at the moment.” She told TheDCNF this is partly because “the liberal media is a propaganda arm for the Democratic Party and they will demonize anyone who tries to hold the president accountable by calling them racist.” Rice politely disagreed with former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, who described attempts to impeach Obama as “asinine.” “Every American has the right to his or her own opinion,” she said. “I would not refute anyone for expressing their own opinion just like I do not want anyone refuting me for expressing my own opinion. We have a freedom of speech under the U.S. Constitution.” The president’s fate, Rice concluded, “is in the hands of the American people.” Follow Breanna on Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "articles": "Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie, a speaker Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, is a close associate of Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Church bulletins obtained by The Daily Caller show that McKenzie was one of 15 speakers — including Father Michael Pfleger and Cornel West — who spoke at Wright’s retirement ceremony as pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in February 2008. Wright has previously sung McKenzie’s praises, identifying her in a 2005 article for his church’s bulletin as a fellow “liberation preacher” — unlike “cooperation preachers,” which include blacks who historically “‘ran and told Massa’ what ‘dem darkies’ were getting ready to do,” wrote Wright. Wright wrote that “cooperation preachers” supported President George W. Bush’s “white racist conservative agenda” by appearing at a White House event alongside the president. And in 2007, McKenzie was again listed as a guest speaker at Wright’s Trinity United. Wright rose to national prominence during the 2008 presidential election as President Barack Obama’s pastor of many years. Audio of Wright’s sermons featured the minister imploring his congregation to have contempt for America. “The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing ‘God Bless America.’ No, no, no, God damn America, that’s in the Bible for killing innocent people,” Wright famously boomed. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Wright declared that “America’s chickens are coming home to roost.” The harsh nature of the media-dominating sermons led then-Sen. Obama to publicly break ties with Wright. “His comments were not only divisive and destructive, but I believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate, and I believe that they do not portray accurately the perspective of the black church,” Obama said in April 2008. “They certainly don’t portray accurately my values and beliefs.” Follow Vince on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Outgoing Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller is late in responding to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul’s inquiry about FBI surveillance drone use, prompting the top U.S. lawmaker to threaten to block the Senate confirmation of Mueller’s replacement. After hearing only silence from Mueller on the FBI’s use of domestic surveillance drones eight days past the junior Kentucky senator’s July 1 deadline, Paul threatened to block the Senate confirmation of James Comey as the new head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Firing off a letter to Mueller on Tuesday, Paul said, “Unfortunately, I have not received any answers to my questions, and I have not been informed as to when I should expect a reply.” On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Comey — who is President Obama’s top pick for the position — over his positions on torture, the Boston Marathon Bombings and the federal government’s surveillance apparatus. Paul notes in his letter that the full Senate could take up consideration of Comey’s confirmation later in the month. Mueller — whose term officially expires on September 4 after 12 years of service — admitted to the heads of the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 19 that the bureau uses drones for domestic surveillance purposes, but their use was “very seldom.” Paul, not happy with the Mueller’s silence on the issue, declared in his recent letter — which was a followup to one sent on June 20 — that “legitimate questions on important government functions should not be ignored.” “These questions are easily answerable and primarily questions of fact, so I respectfully request again that you provide answers to these questions,” said Paul. “As you know, the President has submitted the nomination of your successor to the Senate, the Senate Judiciary Committee has begun consideration of his nomination, and that nomination could be considered by the full Senate this month,” he said. “Without adequate answers to my questions, I will object to the consideration of that nomination and ask my colleagues to do the same,” he said. Paul famously filibustered the Senate confirmation of CIA Director John Brennan with the help of Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee on March 6, demanding clarification from the Obama administration over its policy on domestic drone use and the targeted assassinations of Americans on U.S. soil. Drones, formally called unmanned aerial systems, have been a source of controversy since Obama signed into law the integration of drones into domestic airspace. The FAA was scheduled to begin the integration of “safe” governmental and non-government drones into domestic airspace in August 2012. Paul’s filibuster, which lasted almost 13 hours, generated over a million Tweets, forcing other Republican lawmakers to take notice and run back from a dinner with the White House to make sure they were seen supporting Paul. Attorney General Eric Holder, after having given Congress soft and ambiguous answers on the subject, answered Paul, stating that the President does not have the authority “to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil.” Follow Josh on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "If you listen to the chattering class in Washington, D.C., Hillary Clinton is a virtual certainty for the 2016 Democratic nomination, and the front-runner in the next presidential race. But in private, rumors persist that the former Secretary of State may not even be capable of making it to Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton, these skeptics often say, will not run for president again because of health concerns. These ubiquitous rumors of her health have been fueled in part by the supermarket tabloids. The National Enquirer wrote in 2012 that Clinton had brain cancer, something a spokesman dismissed then as “absolute nonsense.” In January of this year, the Globe claimed that Clinton secretly had a brain tumor. Asked about her health on Thursday, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in an email to The Daily Caller: “To your question, very caring of you to ask. She’s 100%.” But the rumors suggesting otherwise date back to the end of 2012, when Clinton’s health made headlines as she finished her term as secretary of state: aides explained then that she developed a stomach virus, hit her head, suffered a concussion and subsequently developed a blood clot in her brain but was being medicated and was expected to recover. (TheDC TV: Could Clinton be hurting the Democratic Party?) But skeptics say there is much more to the story of her health, which has recently been the subject of increased speculation in Washington. Because of these rumors, some on the right have been convincing themselves that Hillary is sick and therefore won’t run — a bombshell that would upend the 2016 race. Roger Stone, a GOP consultant, wrote on Twitter recently that Clinton is “not running for health reasons,” telling followers to “remember you heard it first” from him. Conservatives aren’t the only ones skeptical about whether Clinton has been open about her health. At the time of Clinton’s hospitalization in 2013, Melinda Henneberger of the Washington Post wrote a piece titled, “How sick is Hillary Clinton?” “Already,” Henneberger wrote, “reports that describe Clinton’s right transverse sinus venous thrombosis as potentially life-threatening, though apparently caught in enough time, sound a lot more serious than the word from her doctors that the secretary is ‘making excellent progress and we are confident she will make a full recovery. She is in good spirits, engaging with her doctors, her family and her staff.'” Henneberger asked then if we would “really be shocked to learn down the road that reports during her hospitalization had put a positive spin on her condition?” “Our public officials have trained us to take everything they say with a healthy dose of skepticism,” Henneberger continued, “and on a matter as sensitive as a head injury followed by denials of any neurological symptoms, I’m not sure why we would or should unquestioningly accept the word of any politician.” Some have noted Clinton’s change in appearance, including the addition of thick glasses, since her hospitalization. “One doesn’t need to be a physician… to have seen that Clinton has not appeared exactly bright-eyed and bushy-tailed of late,” Mary Stanik, a former Minnesota health care spokeswoman, wrote in 2013. “She looks to have gained a significant amount of weight since 2008. She seems pale, tired, and yes, aged. She’s said that she would like to know again what it’s like to not be tired.” Last year, a Clinton aide acknowledged that her health crisis caused her to stop wearing contact lenses. “She’ll be wearing these glasses instead of her contacts for a period of time because of lingering issues stemming from her concussion,” spokesman Philippe Reines told ABC News in 2013. “With them on, she sees just fine.” Follow Alex on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "I don’t know if Roger Ailes did all the stuff he was accused of doing. I do know that he didn’t make Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky carry on a sexual relationship under the roof of the White House and then lie about it. But admitting that wouldn’t help Lewinsky get an editorial published in the New York Times. This did: This is not another obituary for Roger Ailes, who died last week 10 months after being ousted at Fox News. It is, I hope, instead an obituary for the culture he purveyed — a culture that affected me profoundly and personally. Just two years after Rupert Murdoch appointed Mr. Ailes to head the new cable news network, my relationship with President Bill Clinton became public. Mr. Ailes, a former Republican political operative, took the story of the affair and the trial that followed and made certain his anchors hammered it ceaselessly, 24 hours a day… My family and I huddled at home, worried about my going to jail… Meantime, Mr. Ailes huddled with his employees at Fox News, dictating a lineup of talking heads to best exploit this personal and national tragedy. Her editorial goes on like that. She was the victim of mean ol’ Roger Ailes, who exploited her “tragedy” for ratings. Poor Monica Lewinsky. Boo-hoo. Lewinsky decries what she calls our “culture of shame and vitriol.” She says that Ailes is somehow a hypocrite because he made his name by exploiting a sex scandal while being accused of sexual harassment. But Ailes didn’t make her do what she did. Ailes didn’t make Bill Clinton lie about it under oath. I don’t blame her for resenting a lot of the things that people have said about her, myself included, but she’s not a helpless victim. She did what she did. The 42nd President of the United States did what he did. The two of them are responsible for their own actions. Yet in an 839-word piece, Lewinsky mentions Bill Clinton just once. Her harshest words are reserved for the people who reported about his actions. Twenty years later, Monica Lewinsky is still blaming everybody except the one man who’s most responsible for her torment. That’s love for ya. Say, has the NYT’s preferred presidential candidate in 2016 commented on this editorial yet? I’m sure she’s read it. The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Could Mitt Romney and [crscore]John McCain[/crscore] turn out to be the hidden arrows in [crscore]Marco Rubio[/crscore]’s political quiver in New Hampshire? [dcquiz] It’s no secret that Beltway wisdom still argues that the Florida senator is the most likely to win the Republican nomination, even as Donald Trump dominates most of the polls and [crscore]Ted Cruz[/crscore] surges in Iowa. But the unavoidable question for anyone betting on Rubio is: what early state can Marco win? The Daily Beast’s Will Rahn recently pondered the question in a column and couldn’t figure out an early state that Rubio is positioned to win, thus concluding Rubio has been “overrated all along.” The thinking is that while Cruz is well positioned to win Iowa and Trump New Hampshire and possibly South Carolina, there is no state Rubio seems particularly strong in, in part because he does not yet appear to have a robust ground game in any of the early states. I never really understood this thinking. Rubio is in second or third place in the polling averages of each of the three early states in the presidential primary season. If Trump falters, Rubio is right there in the thick of it, particularly in New Hampshire and South Carolina. And lest we forget — and believe me, none of the Republican candidates polling at basically zero and still in the presidential race have forgotten — Rick Santorum not only didn’t lead a single poll before winning the Iowa caucuses in 2012, he didn’t even place second in a single pre-Iowa poll. It is true that Rubio has so far not spent as much time on the ground in the early states as some of his competitors. But as the Republican race enters the final month before voters actually cast ballots, residents of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina will likely begin to see much more of him. But if Trump and Cruz continue to remain strong in the polls, as seems likely at this point, it’s not hard to imagine McCain and Romney coming off the sidelines in an attempt to change the dynamic of the race, most probably in favor of Rubio. Now that [crscore]Lindsey Graham[/crscore] has dropped out, McCain is a free agent. It’s no secret that McCain and Romney dislike Trump and Cruz – and have no desire to see either win the Republican nomination. Perhaps the one place they can act to stop Trump and Cruz is in New Hampshire, where both Romney and McCain remain popular. McCain won the New Hampshire primary in both 2000 and 2008, and Romney won it in 2012. Romney remains so beloved by Republicans in the state that a recent Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll found that the former GOP nominee would lead the Republican field — more than doubling second place Trump with 31 percent to the billionaire’s 15 percent — if he was in the race. So it makes sense that McCain and Romney would get behind the most viable candidate not named Cruz or Trump as the New Hampshire primary approaches in an attempt to save the country from Republican candidates they view as disastrous. Right now, the most viable candidate not named Cruz or Trump is Rubio, though it could potentially end up being Chris Christie or even Jeb Bush if either surges in the Granite State in the coming weeks. “I do think McCain helped Romney in ’12 and think Romney would definitely help any candidate,” former Romney political strategist Stuart Stevens told The Daily Caller in an email after stipulating that he doesn’t know who the former Massachusetts governor intends to endorse, or even if he intends to endorse in the primary at all. “McCain and Romney, along with Lindsey Graham, remain popular in the Granite State – particularly among the more establishment GOPers,” Wayne Lesperance, a professor of political science at New England College in Henniker, N.H., explained to TheDC. “So, their endorsements, if taken together for the same candidate could help identify an establishment candidate around whom voters could rally.” Of course, Rubio would deny he is an establishment candidate – and Lesperance sees Christie as the more likely beneficiary of a McCain-Romney endorsement. Rubio’s communication’s director Alex Conant told TheDC that the campaign has nothing to say about Rubio’s efforts to woo McCain and Romney. But if Rubio is not a card carrying member of the Republican establishment, he is at least seen as a candidate who can bridge the establishment/anti-establishment divide. He is certainly a more acceptable candidate to Washington politicos and many longtime GOP donors than either Cruz or Trump. And both Romney and McCain seem to like Rubio — at least there doesn’t seem to be a great distaste for him like they have for Cruz and Trump. Romney considered Rubio as his VP nominee in 2012 and has spoken highly of him. While McCain has occasionally criticized Rubio for being politically opportunistic, their relationship seems fairly amicable. Obviously, there are some potential downsides to McCain and Romney swooping in an effort to push Rubio over the top in New Hampshire. Rubio certainly doesn’t want to be viewed as an establishment stooge, as Cruz is currently trying to paint him, and being endorsed by Romney and McCain could help forward that narrative. And as famed political prognosticator Larry Sabato told TheDC, New Hampshire voters are an independent bunch and could conceivably react negatively if it appears they are being told how to vote. “My one nagging doubt is that endorsements usually aren’t as earth-shattering as anticipated, and especially so in New Hampshire, the home of the idiosyncratic voter,” he said. But, he noted, “Still, I think the power of McCain and Romney combined would be considerable.” Wouldn’t it be something if at this anti-establishment moment in the American political landscape that the most establishment of Republicans end up giving Rubio the boost he needs to win a crucial early primary state — and, in turn, the momentum to win the Republican nomination?

        "articles": "Donna Brazile, the current head of the Democratic National Committee, appears to have tipped the Clinton campaign off to a question about the death penalty that was going to be asked during a CNN town hall in March, newly released emails show. “From time to time I get the questions in advance,” Brazile wrote in an email to Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri on March 12. Brazile, who was a CNN contributor at the time of the email, went on to ask Palmieri about Clinton’s stance on the death penalty. “Here’s one that worries me about HRC,” wrote Brazile in the email, which was released on Tuesday by Wikileaks. The emails come from the Gmail account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. “Yes, it is one she gets asked about,” Palmieri responded. “Not everyone likes her answer but can share it. Betsaida – can you send her answer on death penalty?” Clinton was indeed asked about her stance on the death penalty during a CNN-hosted town hall the next day in Columbus, Ohio. Ricky Jackson, a former death row inmate who was exonerated after serving 39 years in an Ohio prison, asked Clinton the question. [dcquiz] “I would breathe a sigh of relief if either the courts or the states themselves began to eliminate the death penalty,” Clinton told Jackson. “What happened to you is a travesty and I can’t even imagine what you went through and how terrible those days and nights must have been for all those years,” she continued. The revelation of Brazile’s help for Clinton is ironic given the circumstances by which she came to be interim head of the DNC. She took the position in July after DNC emails released by Wikileaks that month showed that then-chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz was highly critical of Clinton’s primary opponent, Bernie Sanders. The email also undercuts Brazile’s claim throughout the primaries that she was a neutral commentator regarding Clinton and Sanders. Brazile did not issue an endorsement until June 7, when Clinton routed Sanders in California. “I’ve maintained my neutrality, and that’s very important to me as an officer, but I want to say how incredibly important his campaign, I think, has been this entire political season,” she said at the time. The Washington Post was convinced that Brazile was neutral. After Brazile took over as interim head of the DNC, The Post’s Callum Borchers wrote: While Wasserman Schultz was constantly accused by the Sanders campaign of harboring a pro-Clinton bias, Brazile, a regular presence on CNN during coverage of debates and state primaries, consistently provided impartial analysis. “If Democrats were looking for a leader with a proven ability to speak glowingly about their presumptive nominee without disparaging their runner-up, Brazile — a superdelegate who kept her preference to herself — was a logical pick,” Borchers added. Brazile, a longtime party consultant, responded to The Daily Caller’s request for comment. “What a stretch,” she wrote, adding that she was forwarding the request to the DNC. She issued a longer statement later on Tuesday. “As a longtime political activist with deep ties to our party, I supported all of our candidates for president. I often shared my thoughts with each and every campaign, and any suggestions that indicate otherwise are simply untrue,” Brazile said in a statement issued through the DNC. Regarding the CNN town hall, Brazile said “I never had access to questions and would never have shared them with the candidates if I did.” Brazile went on to blast Wikileaks, accusing the site of being linked to the Russian government. She did not offer an explanation in her statement for why her email to Palmieri, sent a day before the town hall, referred to questions that were asked in the town hall. Barbara Levin, CNN’s vice president of communications, denied sharing the town hall questions with Brazile. “To be perfectly clear, we have never, ever given a town hall question to anyone beforehand,” she told TheDC. DNC press secretary Mark Paustenbach Update: Business Insider is reporting that a Democratic party official says that Brazile’s email was not based on a CNN town hall question. Instead, the official claims that the question was for a panel Brazile was set to appear on. But Mediaite notes that the question asked by town hall co-host Roland Martin was very similar to the message Brazile sent to Palmieri. “Secretary Clinton, since 1976, we have executed 1,414 people in this country. Since 1973, 156 who were convicted have been exonerated from the death row. This gentleman here is one of them,” Martin said in his introduction of Jackson, citing statistics that were included in the same email Brazile sent to the campaign. CNN’s Brian Stelter reported later Tuesday that when Martin, a host on TV One, was asked whether he or someone from his staff provided town hall questions to Brazile, he did not deny it. “My questions were shared with my executive producer and several members of my TV One team,” Martin told Stelter. He did not respond to the follow-up question of whether he could rule out that the questions were sent to Brazile. For her part, Brazile denied to Stelter that she “had no access to any questions.” This post has been updated with comments from Brazile and CNN.

        "articles": "WCCB livestream screengrab The violent riots that broke out in Charlotte after a black police officer shot and killed a black man fall into a line of similar race-related riots that mark President Barack Obama’s legacy. Under Obama, the number of both white and black Americans who believe race relations are good has declined, and a July Rasmussen poll found 60 percent of Americans think race relations are worse; a growing number of violent riots across the country seem to back up that sentiment. Here are more than 10 riots that have occurred since Obama took office in 2008. Charlotte – 2016 Residents of Charlotte, N.C., took to the streets after police shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott, a 43-year-old black man. His wife says he didn’t have a gun, but police say Scott was in fact brandishing a weapon they found at the scene. The incident quickly set off violent riots, in which nine people were injured and 44 arrested. At one point, rioters tried to burn a reporter alive, and a state of emergency has been declared. A man was shot and killed, and 12 police officers have been injured. Milwaukee – 2016 Rioting broke out in Milwaukee, Wisc., in August after Sylville Smith, a 23-year-old black male, was shot and killed by police. Though Smith had a gun in his hand and was turning toward an officer at the time of his killing, many saw the incident as part of a wider pattern of racial profiling and excessive force used on black suspects in Milwaukee. In response, demonstrators set businesses, buildings and cars ablaze. A gas station was set on fire, rioters threw a brick a police officer’s head, and some shot off guns. Arrests were made. St. Paul – 2016 In July, St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez shot Philando Castile, a 32-year-old black male he mistook for a robbery suspect. The aftermath was recorded on a cellphone by Diamond Reynolds, a woman who was a passenger in Castile’s car at the time of his shooting. Protests — initially peaceful — began with people shutting down a highway in St. Paul, Minn., in July. As protesters and police faced off, the situation devolved into violence. Twenty-one officers were injured and 100 rioters were arrested. Cinder blocks and fireworks were used as weapons against police. Mayor Chris Coleman referred to the situation as a riot. Baltimore – 2015 Baltimore gained nationwide attention in April 2015 after the death of Freddie Gray in the back of a police van. Gray’s death, the result of spinal cord injuries, has led to some accusing officers of giving Gray a “rough ride” — a form of police brutality. The community broke out into riots, and 15 officers were injured. Thirty-five arrests were made in one night. Rioters destroyed cars and buildings, infamously setting a CVS Pharmacy on fire. When firefighters tried to put the fire out, somebody cut a hole in the hose. Some rioters tried to light a pizza shop owner on fire by dousing him in lighter fluid. Berkeley – 2014 In December 2014, protests in the Berkeley area broke out in response to both the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two black males killed by police in 2014. The police officers involved were not indicted in either case. The demonstrations quickly devolved into disorder, with rioters throwing rocks and bricks at officers, starting fires, looting, and damaging police cars and stores, leading to arrests. Ferguson – 2014 In reaction to both the shooting of Brown and the Grand Jury decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for it, riots and general unrest plagued Ferguson, Missouri for several months in late 2014. Beginning in August, looting and destruction of businesses occurred, and rioting took place again in late November after the decision not to indict. Buildings were set on fire, police cars destroyed, and violent protests persisted throughout the night. Police responded with tear gas in an effort to disperse rioters. A Department of Justice report later cleared police officer Darren Wilson of any wrongdoing. Ferguson has also seen unrest on anniversaries of Brown’s shooting, with shootings in 2015 and gunfire in 2016 after a car struck a protester. Brooklyn – 2013 Sparked by the New York Police Department shooting of Kimani Gray, an armed 16-year-old black male, riots broke out in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn. Gray was armed, and officers say he pointed his gun at police. Still, some alleged police brutality. A vigil for Gray that started out peacefully became violent, with stores and bodegas looted and bystanders hurt. Rioters smashed windows and trashed a Rite Aid, also beating and robbing a man at the Rite Aid. The riots continued for several more nights. Police officers were injured, including one hit in the face with a brick. Officers arrested 50 people. Anaheim – 2012 In July 2012, riots broke out in Anaheim, Calif., after two Latino men, Manuel Diaz and Joel Acevedo, were shot in unrelated incidents in consecutive days. Tensions heightened as some saw the incidents as police brutality against Latino residents. Rioters kicked police cars, set trash cans on fire, and broke business windows. Some threw rocks and bricks at cops, and police fired bean bags, pepper spray, and rubber bullets into the crowd. Los Angeles – 2012 Police estimated 150 people participated in a July 2012 riot to protest George Zimmerman’s acquittal in the Trayvon Martin murder trial on Los Angeles’ Crenshaw Boulevard. Many saw Zimmerman’s targeting of Martin as racial profiling; Obama remarked, “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon.” Rioters assaulted police, stomped cars, broke windows, started fires and beat reporters. Eleven people were arrested in San Bernadino, Calif., for throwing rocks and bricks. Los Angeles – 2010 The Westlake neighborhood of Los Angeles was rocked in September 2010 with violent protests after the police shooting of a Latino man named Manuel Ramirez. Ramirez was intoxicated and wielding a knife, but many thought the officers’ reaction to quickly shoot him was excessive. During the riots, police officers were hit with bottles and rocks, injuring two, and leading to four arrests for inciting a riot. Rioters also lit trash cans and mattresses on fire. Oakland – 2010 [dcquiz] On Jan. 1, 2009, Oakland police officer Johannes Mehserle shot Oscar Grant, an unarmed black male. Grant was lying on the floor when he was shot, and Mehserle claims he accidentally fired his gun when he went to grab his taser. Some activists referred to the shooting as a murder. Riots erupted in Oakland, with several businesses destroyed and cars set on fire. In June 2010, when Mehserle was convicted of involuntary manslaughter instead of murder in the shooting of Grant, rioting again took place across Oakland. Looting occurred, businesses were damaged and vandalized, and at least 100 arrests were made.

        "articles": "Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon apparently had little faith that the Missouri National Guard could show restraint during the violent protests that unfolded in Ferguson last week. Nixon had activated 2,200 guardsmen as officials feared violent protests in the event of a St. Louis County grand jury’s decision to not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting death of Michael Brown. But only 700 were deployed, and those went to the city of St. Louis and to nearby Clayton, leaving many questioning the move in the wake of the destruction of much of Ferguson, where a dozen businesses were burned to the ground. “The plan was that the law enforcement officers who have been trained would be out on the front lines,” Nixon told KTVI reporter Chris Hayes. “You didn’t want to have a Kent State situation,” Nixon continued, referencing a May 4, 1970 incident in which Ohio National Guardsmen killed four university students and wounded nine others during Vietnam War protests. “You certainly didn’t want to have a situation where Guardsmen who had only been there a few hours, who had not been used to the very kinetic atmosphere of people throwing things, screaming things at the very front tip of that spear,” said Nixon. “That was the plan. I think it has prevented loss of life.” Nixon’s comparison is a strange one. There is no evidence that the Kent State protesters acted violently towards the Ohio National Guard, whereas Ferguson protesters showed a strong penchant for violence. At least two police cars were set on fire during the night of mayhem. Besides the arson and looting, dozens of gunshots could be heard on live television during the riot. Until he spoke to KTVI, Nixon had avoided answering the question of why only 700 out of 2,200 Missouri National Guardsmen were deployed during the mayhem. Ferguson’s mayor James Knowles said after the night of rioting that his calls to Nixon seeking help were not answered. “So then why did Rapid Response sit and watch businesses burn?” KTVI’s Hayes asked Nixon. “Well as I said before the plan that night was to make sure we had officers out there,” he said. “But they weren’t out there,” Hayes replied. Nixon responded, “There were 700, yes they were.” “But there were 1500 sitting and waiting,” said Hayes, adding that there were “700 out on the streets and 1500 waiting for a call.” “There were 700 assigned that night, others came later as the night went on.” Follow Chuck on Twitter Follow Chuck on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "REUTERS/Carlos Barria A church organist was arrested Wednesday after he vandalized his own church with a swastika and pro-Trump graffiti in order to “mobilize a movement.” [dcquiz] George Nathaniel Stang, 26, admitted in a handwritten statement to spray painting a swastika, “fag church,” and “heil Trump” on St. David’s Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom, Indiana. “I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good, even if it was a false flag,” Stang wrote, according to a local NBC report. “To be clear my actions were not motivated by hate for the church or its congregation. I of course realize now, this was NOT the way to go about inspiring activism.” The incident occurred in November shortly after President Trump was elected and was widely covered by the press. The Washington Post reported on it and connected it to Trump’s victory, “The offensive graffiti at St. David’s is among numerous incidents that have occurred in the wake of Trump’s Election Day win.” They also mentioned the vandalism in a piece entitled, “The postelection hate spike: How long will it last?” It was mentioned in 15 articles by The Post, yet, as of publication time, they have yet to write about Stang’s arrest. The vandalism was also covered by CNN in the story “‘Make America White Again’: Hate speech and crimes post-election.” Just like the Post, CNN has yet to write an updated story.

The Daily Caller News Foundation reported on five hoaxes in the weeks after the November election, including a Muslim woman who lied about her hijab being stolen by Trump supporters. Just two weeks ago, a Muslim professor at an Indiana university was arrested after he fabricated anti-Muslim crimes. The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Every major economic indicator in the United States improved during and after the Clinton-era government shutdown that has dominated news analysis columns throughout the “defund Obamacare” debate. Although the spending gaps that occurred from November 1995 to January 1996 are depicted almost unanimously by politicians and the establishment media as disasters for the United States, in fact the so-called shutdowns, during which a portion of government spending was temporarily reduced, did no discernible damage to the American economy, and may have boosted the financial well-being of the American people. “I mean whatever effect Obamacare might have on the economy is far less than even a few days of government shutdown,” President Obama declared in a speech to supporters Thursday, giving a characteristic point of view that seems to be shared by a majority of Americans, who strongly oppose a government shutdown. A review of economic performance, however, tells a very different story. The spending gaps of the Clinton presidency occurred from Nov. 14 through Nov. 19, 1995 and from Dec. 16, 1995 to Jan. 6, 1996. Despite the greatly ballyhooed furloughs of government employees, unemployment stayed even at 5.6 percent during November 1995, the period of the first spending gap, which ended when a deal cut by President Bill Clinton and Republican legislators allowed government to stay funded at 75 percent. Unemployment actually dropped to 5.5 percent during the second spending gap, which was more complete than the first. Unemployment continued to plummet in the months following the shutdown, as a hamstrung Clinton allowed the rate of government spending increases to slow and headed toward the eventual budget surpluses that became the highlight of Clinton’s legacy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment dropped half a percentage point within a year of the first shutdown and had dipped below five percent by the spring of 1997. More surprisingly, gross domestic product increased during both quarters covered by the Clinton-era shutdowns. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, GDP began the fourth quarter of 1995 at $7.7 trillion and ended the second quarter of 1996 at $7.9 trillion. By the end of the second quarter 1996 GDP had topped $8 trillion. Personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment and personal income also increased during and immediately after the shutdown. The GDP numbers are particularly striking because government spending is given outsized weight in GDP measures, which assume that every dollar in federal spending results in a full dollar’s worth of economic activity. Nevertheless, GDP continued to climb despite the suspension of transfer payments. With a recent CNBC poll showing 59 percent opposition to the current shutdown threat, few are willing to speak up for the 1995-96 shutdown, though Newt Gingrich, who was House Speaker at the time, did argue over the summer that the dispute helped Republicans and paved the way to balanced budgets. Harry Reid suggested people ask me about the effect of the 1995 government shutdown. It worked. We balanced the budget for 4 years. — Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) July 30, 2013 Harry Reid asked about impact of 1995 govt shutdown. First reelected house gop majority since 1928. Welfare reformed. Budgets balanced. — Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) July 30, 2013 By focusing only on public policy, however, Gingrich is being too modest. The best argument for the Clinton-era shutdown is found in the private economy. According to Federal Reserve flow of funds data [pdf], personal income also spiked throughout the period of the shutdown, from $5.2 trillion in the fourth quarter of 1995 to $6.3 trillion in the first quarter and $6.4 trillion in the second quarter of 1996. One economic indicator that did take a dip during the shutdown period was the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, a “soft” measure that takes account of psychological rather than financial effects. Consumer confidence dipped sharply in December 1995 but rebounded rapidly throughout 1996. That the Clinton-era shutdown produced no negative effects on our nation’s prosperity is not entirely surprising, according to one economist. Mark Vaughn, a fellow at the Weidenbaum Center at Washington University in St. Louis, notes that economic growth in the mid-1990s was more vigorous than it is today, and that the shutdown, however much it has grown in the popular imagination, was actually brief, totaling only 26 days over a period of three months. “All the models we have of consumer behavior show that people spend based on their lifetime income, subject to short-term liquidity issues they may have,” Vaughn told The Daily Caller. “If people expect this to be a short shutdown, you’re not going to see much effect.” Vaughn compares the non-disaster of the mid-90s to this year’s panic over the budget sequester, which also failed to inflict significant damage on the economy. “If you think about it, government does two things,” he says. “It purchases stuff and buys labor. For the labor part, the gap probably won’t last very long, and in the past people ended up getting paid for the time off; even if they don’t you’re most likely only talking about a few days. And as far as purchases, all you have to do is delay the purchase for a few days.” There are substantial differences between 1995 and 2013 that suggest a spending gap might play out differently this year. The size of the government has vastly expanded; a raft of new federal regulations on business and finance have been passed; the number of Americans on federal public assistance has exploded; measures of private net worth, income and indebtedness are all much worse than they were in the 1990s. Vaughn notes that the economy as a whole is much weaker in the Obama era than it was in the Clinton era. “Still,” he told TheDC, “I think the lesson is — don’t bet on a large negative effect of a shutdown.” Follow Tim on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Screenshot/Fox News Author Shelby Steele said Thursday that Critical Race Theory was a coordinated effort to “capture white guilt.” Critical Race Theory (CRT) holds that America is fundamentally racist, yet it teaches people to view every social interaction and person in terms of race. Its adherents pursue “antiracism” through the end of merit, objective truth and the adoption of race-based policies. Steele joined “Fox News Primetime” host Ben Domenech to discuss recent claims that conservatives have only voiced objections to CRT because they feared change. (RELATED: Fauci Has ‘Outlived His Usefulness’: Ben Domenech Says Demand For Masks After Vaccines Is ‘Dangerous’) WATCH: “If you don’t like Critical Race Theory, you are threatened by change. That’s how the left is framing it now,” Domenech began as he introduced Steele as his guest. “Washington Post columnist Christine Emba writes, ‘It is a psychological defense not a rational one and it has become so prominent because the status quo is comfortable and accountability is not.'” Domenech argued that CRT was toxic and “unAmerican,” asking Steele what he believed could be done to push back against it as many in power attempt to promote it. “I think they have to begin with the understanding that Critical Race Theory is a device designed to capture white guilt. It has no other meaning, no other purpose, no other function than that. It wants to capture, to once again accuse whites of racism,” Steele said. Steele went on to explain that once CRT was used to convince everyone that structural racism had bled into every aspect of American life, the goal was to use the guilt it created to advance black Americans by creating entitlements for them. “It’s a structural systemic society-wide problem and to the extent of its breadth, it owes us as blacks entitlement,” he added. “What bothers me most is that the whites — we have been doing this now for 70 years, and whites still don’t get the point,” Steele continued. “You are being had. You are being shaken down over a history that you had nothing to do with, and there has to be some standing up there.” Follow Virginia on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Dartmouth College has responded to intensely negative national media coverage over a Black Lives Matter protest that harassed white students by issuing an apology, not to the students who were harassed, but instead to the protesters themselves for being subject to conservative criticism. A group of about 150 Dartmouth students paraded Thursday through the school’s Baker-Berry Library, chanting “Black Lives Matter” and harassing students in the library who were attempting to study. A writer with the school’s independent conservative paper, The Dartmouth Review, claimed to see a girl pinned up against a wall as protesters called her a “filthy white bitch.” Chants of “Fuck your white privilege!” and “You filthy white piece of shit!” were reported as well, and some witnesses claim doors were blocked off and specific students targeted for verbal attacks if they refused to join into the protest. One student who attempted to flee the protest reportedly came under a barrage of harassment from protesters who allegedly screamed obscenities at them. The protest, unsurprisingly, has inspired a wave of critical media coverage, with writers focusing on both the verbal harassment and allegations that some students may have suffered physical attack. Tsion Abera, a junior and vice president of Dartmouth’s NAACP branch, denied that any protesters were violent but said there was profanity and harassment, and that it was all part of the plan. “These allegations of physical assault are lies to make white students look like the victims and students of color to look like the perpetrators,” Abera told The Dartmouth. “The protest was meant to shut down the library. Whatever discomfort that many white students felt in that library is a fraction of the discomfort that many Natives, blacks, Latina and LGBTQ people feel frequently.” But despite the spectacular scene, Dartmouth College officials have made a rather weak response. The day after the protest, college president Phil Hanlon sent out a campus-wide email that affirmed the importance of treating people with “dignity and respect” but made no mention of the Thursday protest that obviously prompted it. The school released a short statement Monday saying that no reports of violence had been made to the school, but that other complaints related to the protest were being investigated. Leigh Remy, head of Dartmouth’s judicial affairs office, told The Dartmouth that several “bias incident” reports had been made by students who claim to have felt intimidated by the protest. But Remy said that several more complaints were coming from the protesters themselves, who claim to feel unsafe after being accused of violence on social media platforms like Yik Yak. In fact, so far, the only people Dartmouth has seen fit to apologize to are the protesters themselves. During a Monday night community discussion at the school’s black affinity dormitory, vice provost for student affairs Inge-Lise Ameer apologized to protesters for the hostile coverage their protest received. “There’s a whole conservative world out there that’s not being very nice,” Ameer said to the protesters.

Landon Rice, 22, James Marsicano, 23, Eleanor Everette, 16, and Ngogloan Tran, 25, were arrested for obstructing traffic. Marsicano was also charged for resisting a public officer.

Scott! #keithlamontscott  — Charlotte Uprising (@cltuprising) December 1, 2016 The group provided a link to the Freedom Fighter Bond Fund, a project of the Durham Solidarity Center. The Durham Solidarity Center is a volunteer-run organization that has hosted events like “Stop The War On Black America” and “Justice For Trayvon.” “To comply with applicable IRS regulations, any funds we solicit are not earmarked for any specific person’s bail or legal costs—but rather for the Freedom Fighter Fund in general, which is dedicated in its mission to oppose state repression and support those who act in good conscience to advance the cause of justice and equity,” the website states. Those who receive bond money, the website says, must follow certain “Principles of Unity.” This includes refraining from publicly denouncing activists in the media and refusing to assist police officers in actions against other activists. Protesters marched Wednesday night through the streets of Uptown Charlotte, chanting “Stop the Lies!” The protesters were upset over the announcement that black officer Vinson was justified in shooting Scott. “I’m out here today to protest the lack of indictment for the officers who murdered Keith Lamont Scott,” a student insisted to NBC News. “To me it reflects the ultimate continued theme of what we’ve seen throughout this nation’s history, where the state protects the states interest.” District Attorney Andrew Murray declared that “all available and credible evidence” suggested Scott was armed at the time. Fifteen career prosecutors reviewed the investigation and all came to the same conclusion over the shooting, Murray said.

        "articles": "oneinchpunch/Shutterstock. Research scientists have devised a new framework that allows them to predict future terrorist actions with more than 90 percent accuracy. Researchers at Binghamton University, State University of New York, created the Network Pattern Recognition (NEPAR) Framework. NEPAR is a comprehensive system which can predict a terrorist’s future activity by defining and analyzing useful patterns of attack. By recognizing terrorist behaviors, the framework can help detect and prevent terrorist behaviors. While U.S. intelligence agencies are remarkably capable, they cannot always use social media and telecommunications to discover future terrorist attacks. The NEPAR Framework helps fill the gap. “Terrorists are learning, but they don’t know they are learning. If we can’t monitor them through social media or other technologies, we need to understand the patterns. Our framework works to define which metrics are important,” Binghamton University Ph.D student Salih Tutun told PsyPost in an article published Thursday. Tatun examined similarities between terrorist attacks, such as those in Paris in 2015 and Sept. 11, 2001, for example. He then created networks by determining if there is any relationship. “Maybe one attack in the past and another attack have a big relationship, but nobody knows. We tried to extract this information,” he explained. Tutun, assisted by Systems Science and Industrial Engineering department head Mohammad Khasawneh, developed the framework by examining data on more than 150, 000 terrorist attacks between 1970 and 2015. He calculated the relationships among terrorist attacks, such as attack time and weapon type, and detected terrorist behaviors. The network uses the relationships between past terrorist attacks to uncover futures ones. When compared with the results of existing data, the new framework successfully predicted the characteristics of attacks with more than 90 percent accuracy. Tutun’s new method is revolutionary, as past terrorist research has generally focused on the behavior of singular terrorists. Armed with the NEPAR, officials could implement policies to help defend against future attacks. “Predicting terrorist events is a dream, but protecting some area by using patterns is a reality. If you know the patterns, you can reduce the risks,” said Tutun. “It’s not about predicting, it’s about understanding.” Follow Russ Read on Twitter Send tips to russ@newsfoundation.org.

        "articles": "Fossil fuels have taken a beating in the media in recent years over concerns carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal, oil and gas for electricity are driving global warming. Environmentalists and politicians want you to believe CO2 from fossil fuels is the greatest evil of our time, but they ignore the enormous benefits combusting coal, oil or gas brings to society. The Daily Caller News Foundation presents some of the many reasons to be thankful for fossil fuels this Thanksgiving. 1. Coal Kept The Lights On We hear a lot about how solar and wind energy are the future, but we never hear how these unreliable power sources require fossil fuels to provide back-up power to keep the lights on. Despite billions of federal tax dollars for green energy use, coal and natural gas produce the lion’s share of electricity in America — not to mention heating people’s homes during frigid winters. Even when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing (they often peak at different times of the day), fossil fuels still keep a steady supply of electricity and heat flowing to homes. In fact, coal power saved millions of Americans from losing electricity during the “polar vortex” of 2014. As polar winds brought freezing weather into the U.S. northeast, natural gas power plants lacked the supplies and infrastructure to keep the lights on and green energy was unable to generate power in fierce weather. Luckily, coal-fired power plants were there to keep people from freezing to death. Power companies turned on 89 percent of the coal-fired power capacity slated to be shut down by federal regulations to keep heat and power on for millions of people. “If our reliability had failed during the polar vortex… there’s no question people would have died,” West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said of the near-disaster. 2. Fossil Fuels Are ‘Greening’ The World Environmentalists like to argue fossil fuels are making people dumber, but they never talk about how CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion are “greening” the Earth by boosting plant growth. Higher CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere mean more food for plant life, allowing them to grow. CO2 also acts as a substitute for water, so even some of the most arid regions of the world are “greening,” in part, due to carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion. “Carbon dioxide fertilizes plants, and emissions from fossil fuels have already had a hugely beneficial effect on crops, increasing yields by at least 10-15%,” according to a report by the U.K.-based Global Warming Policy Foundation. 3. Fossil Fuels Eradicate Poverty Would you believe coal power has lifted billions of people out of poverty since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution? Well, it’s true. In fact, coal, oil and natural gas provided countries with cheap sources of energy for well over a century. Yes, increased fossil fuel use has caused CO2 emissions to skyrocket, but rising CO2 is highly correlated with poverty eradication. fixed it again. pic.twitter.com/8U7CZhXXmF — David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) November 23, 2015 Before coal, most people relied on wind, solar and animal power to keep the engine of society running. Wind and solar are the energy sources of the 13th Century, as some economists have noted — remember, Don Quixote wasn’t fighting coal plants. Coal, oil and natural gas provide economies with cheap, reliable energy. It’s only with cheap energy that economies can grow. President Barack Obama and other countries are trying to break that model by refusing to finance overseas coal projects, and instead funnel more money to green energy. But Obama’s refusal to fund coal projects ignores a fact of history: coal has been essential in poverty reduction in developing countries. “If coal-fueled China were taken out of the equation, the number of the world’s poor has actually risen since the 1980s,” said Milton Catelin, chief executive of the World Coal Association “Virtually all of the world’s poverty reduction between 1981 and 2008 took place in China,” Catelin said. “No other poverty alleviation strategy in modern history has been more effective than the one implemented by China and driven by an economy fueled at over 70 percent by coal.” Follow Michael on Facebook and Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

One of the most prominent marches occurred in Washington, D.C., where hundreds of students marched from the White House to the U.S. Capitol. A CNN reporter asked students gathering in front of the Capitol what they were marching for. “What do you want to see done here in the halls of Congress to stop violence like this from happening in the future?” the reporter asked a student. The student said she was understanding of people who want to own a “hand gun” to “protect” themselves but that “the average person should be able to get a weapon of war.” “I understand if you want to protect yourself, you could get a handgun, but if I wanted to see a change, it’d be that assault rifles and automatic weapons be taken away from the average person,” she continued. She finished her comments by saying, “At this point in time, it’s way too easy to access one and cause mass destruction.” In response, the CNN reporter said, “Thank you,” without asking how the confiscation of legally purchased firearms would occur or noting that fully automatic weapons have nearly been entirely outlawed for any civilian since 1986.

        "articles": "Screenshot Fox 45 Baltimore School systems across the country are seeking to abolish honors classes, teach how math has been used to oppress people, and let truant students into gifted schools. Advocates say the moves are aimed at diminishing an achievement gap between demographic groups. In one county, a busing initiative led to a populist uprising and rare bipartisan unity. Parents spanning races and parties say they did not ask for the changes, but politicians are pushing them through, anyway. In October, Seattle public schools unveiled a “framework” to inject “math ethnic studies” into all K-12 math classes, teaching “how math has been and continues to be used to oppress and marginalize people and communities of color.” Students will be asked to “identify the inherent inequities of the standardized testing system used to oppress and marginalize people and communities of color” and “explain how math dictates economic oppression.” “Why/how does data-driven processes prevent liberation?” it asks. “How important is it to be Right? What is Right? Says Who?” The curriculum was pushed by the school district’s ethnic studies program manager, Tracy Castro-Gill, who on Oct. 19 tweeted a picture with her “Marxist ringleader” and said the “next step is matching “INDOCTRINATED” t-shirts!” “I am an educator of color in Seattle whose job is anti-racist work within the school district. Seattle is very white — nearly 70%. It’s also one of the most liberal cities in the US, and these liberal, white Seattleites hate being called racist, but the thing is – a lot of them are,” she wrote. Though she was hired by the superintendent and the school board, Castro-Gill said criticisms of the math proposal from one board member’s Asian wife were racist. She also asked people to “help me push” the board and superintendent to oppose “rewhiting.” Castro-Gill wrote on her blog that her mother is white and her father is Hispanic, but that she has a strained relationship. “I’m fairly radical atheist and consider myself a far left anarchist who fights for racial justice,” she wrote. “My parents are both Trump supporting Republicans.” She is also at odds with her child’s father after their child declared herself “nonbinary” after reading literature about transgenderism. A spokesman for Seattle’s superintendent, Denise Juneau, did not return a request for comment. Tracy Castro-Gill, the Seattle schools’ Equity Manager. / Seattle Public Schools photo In Howard County, Maryland, the school board appears poised to proceed with a plan, drafted by an out-of-state consultant, to bus 7,300 students out of their neighborhood schools to adjust the distribution of impoverished students in each school — despite that no discernible constituency is asking for it. The county council said its goal is to “address the achievement gaps by racial and socioeconomic factors.” The plan would move students based on how many receive free and reduced meals in those neighborhoods. Additionally, Howard is the most-integrated school system in the state, the Baltimore Sun reported. But the county council’s resolution says any school with less than 40% white students is defined as segregated. In Howard County, 39% of students are white, meaning that by its logic, if every school exactly reflected the racial makeup of the county as a whole, every school in Howard County would be segregated. Resident Carl Manganillo testified Oct. 10 that the board had heard 2,500 comments with opponents outnumbering supporters of the plan 100-1. “As far as I can tell, the only proponents of this plan are the politicians,” he said. Asian, white, black, and Hispanic parents marched in the streets in massive protests. “I want to stay with my friends,” a fourth-grader pleaded. “Keep the ‘unity’ in community,” a black mother urged. More than 80 people spoke at a hearing Oct. 7, and not one of them wanted the plan to proceed, CBS’s Baltimore affiliate reported. Lori Grant, who is an assistant director at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission — the federal government’s anti-discrimination arm — and the mother of a black student in a Howard school, testified in her personal capacity that the school board should not proceed with the plan and that it is likely illegal. “Basically, they could care less what the parents think,” resident George Henry said in a letter to the Baltimore Sun. With parents overwhelmingly opposed, state politicians got in the mix — one cutting the line of people testifying — to attempt to push the county policy across the finish line. In a Facebook group that quickly attracted 4,000 members, a near populist revolt fomented, with members pledging to vote every Howard politician out of office. Larry Walker, a member of the Attendance Area Committee that helped form the plan, is also a pastor at Celebration Church, and said at a Sept. 8 service: “We have a partnership with the school system and the superintendent is looking for brown people to show up and put our voices behind this plan that he came out with — it’s a bold plan and the community is hatin’ on it right now — they’re hatin’ on it… he needs some allies, folks.” School spokesman Brian Bassett did not respond to questions from the DCNF about what kind of partnership the government has with a church, and why the superintendent was “looking” for people to support a plan rather than drafting one with organic public support. An out-of-state consultant drew a plan to move students out of their high schools to achieve demographic “equity” in Howard County, Md. / Howard County school board In the nation’s largest school system, a panel appointed by the mayor proposed in August to eliminate the city’s gifted and talented schools and programs in the service of racial integration garnered front-page New York Times coverage. The proposal would end the practice of gifted and talented schools screening students by exams and grades — and even block considering students’ attendance records at their previous schools. It also said it was unfair that students who were not fluent in English were “underrepresented” in the most rigorous academic programs. “If you get rid of testing, you’re open to subjective decision-making … you’ll see a lot of parents send their children to private schools, and you’re just furthering the income gap,” David Lee of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance told New York’s CBS affiliate. Robert Cornegy, a black Democratic city councilman from Brooklyn, told the Times the proposal seemed to come from “uber liberals” and said minorities are not served well by taking the rigor out of education. “If you eliminate the gifted and talented program it eliminates the chances of getting into specialized programs and institutions of higher learning,” he said. “Just like there’s a pipeline to prison, there is a pipeline to higher academic success and college.” Jonathan Plucker, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the National Association for Gifted Children’s board, told the Times, “You can say everyone is being treated the same, but if they are being treated poorly, that’s a horrible form of equity.” Still, New York schools chancellor Richard Carrenza said “this is not about lowering the bar.” In May, three white school administrators sued Carrenza’s Department of Education for $90 million, saying “DOE has swiftly and irrevocably silenced, sidelined and punished plaintiffs and other Caucasian female DOE employees on the basis of their race, gender and unwillingness to accept their other colleagues’ hateful stereotypes about them,” the New York Post reported. LaShawn Robinson, then the executive director of the DOE’s Office of Equity and Access, said “values of white culture are supremacist,” according to the lawsuit. Robinson replaced Lois Herrera, a Harvard graduate who had worked for the schools since 1986, with a black man, stashed her belongings under a stairwell, demoted her three levels and transferred her to the Bronx, it stated. Another plaintiff, Jaye Murray, was forced to report her activities to the new boss every 30 minutes, it said. The third plaintiff, Laura Feijoo, was replaced by a black woman who did not have the necessary license to do the job, it stated. Separately, a fourth white female former employee, Leslie Chislett, sued New York’s DOE for $20 million. Chislett had spearheaded a campaign to promote Advanced Placement classes for more students, but “Unfortunately, under Chancellor Carranza’s leadership, something has gone very wrong with the Equity and Excellence agenda,” she told The Post. All DOE employees were forced to undergo “training” sessions that told them a desire for “excellence” was part of “white supremacy,” Chislett’s lawsuit stated. “There is white toxicity in the air,” DOE senior executive Ruby Ababio-Fernandez said in a school presentation, according to the suit. A spokeswoman did not return a request for comment. Maya Wiley of NYC’s Diversity Advisory Group calls for reforming gifted education. PIX11 screenshot In Fairfax County, Virginia, the school board eliminated the position of Chief Academic Officer and replaced it with a Chief Equity Officer. It also proposed revising the boundary-drawing process to remove “instructional effectiveness” and “the impact on neighborhoods” as factors, in favor of “the socioeconomic and/or racial composition of students.” (RELATED: Behind The Network Of Outside, Left-Wing Groups Pushing Racial Policies In Cities, Counties Across America) For 18 months, the board repeatedly discussed an imperative to gain “equity” in school demographics, but with an election Nov. 5, it suddenly sought to distance itself from the rhetoric. The board is “not considering boundary adjustments at this time,” spokeswoman Kathleen Thomas told the DCNF. The school system hired a consultant to study boundary changes in the context of its “equity” policy. Parent Laura Timmins told the DCNF she suspects the board is looking to offload it onto a third party to shield politicians from blowback for moves that are unpopular with residents. Prior to community uproar, the board seemed to recognize that residents would not be in favor of the plan, and that subtlety would be imperative. Board member Karen Keys-Gamarra said in a school board meeting that “I have no problem with certainly alerting the community as gently as we can, because, like you, I’m not sure I want to hear about this for the next 10 years.” When constituents from an area with a high-performing school told their school board member, Janie Strauss, that such changes could plummet their home values, Strauss flatly denied any changes were afoot. But she also told colleagues at a board meeting she had “warned” the school’s community that a “big chunk is going to be reboundaried.” Board member Pat Hynes appeared to acknowledge that removing children from their schools in the name of racial integration would be for naught if the existence of rigorous honors classes still separated children based on test scores. “Changing school boundaries must be primary tool of integrating schools for diversity. But equally important is ending counter-productive sorting-and-separating that creates segregated schools-within-schools. Goal = integrated classrooms,” she tweeted from a presentation at the National School Board Association’s 2019 conference. In one school in Fairfax, 78% of students failed “plain English Algebra” and 30% failed a basic competency test in English, leading Timmins and other parents in the second-richest county in the U.S. to wonder how their children could apply to competitive colleges if they were required to take the same classes. The racial focus of the 12-person school board — fueled by its eight white Democrats — led liberal residents to turn against the party, with one saying she’s cast ballots for Democrats in every election since 1971, but “when it comes to this year’s County level races that will not happen.” School bus with bullet holes (Shutterstock/Puffin’s Pictures) In July, Eastern Carver County, Minnesota — which is 87% white — revealed it had hired Dr. Muhammad Khalifa to do an “equity audit.” It also hired Dr. Keith Brooks as Director of Equity, who compared himself to Trayvon Martin and said “my questioning, or asking questions, or looking at things through an equity lens comes off as belligerent or angry.” In protest against a board they perceived as being unresponsive to their constituency, some residents pledged to vote in November to deny a funding request the school system says is needed for a new school. “Khalifa was paid $90,000, Dr. Brooks got $138,000, and you’re saying you don’t have enough money for education, then what are you spending it on this stuff for?” Lynn McHale, a member of Parents for D112 schools, told the DCNF. “There’s a girl who came home from school and cried and said I wish I wasn’t white after she was exposed to this ‘equity’ stuff,” she said. “The superintendents of the nearby jurisdictions have joined into a group called Reimagine Minnesota, and it’s pushing race,” she continued. She suspects it wants to “consolidate into one metropolitan school district, where they would bus inner city kids from Minneapolis to the suburbs,” relating to a lawsuit called Cruz-Guzman. Reimagine Minnesota says its purpose is a “collective action plan to address integration.” Celi Haga, a school spokeswoman, told the DCNF the school system was not fulfilling its mission “as long as the outcomes for groups of students are meaningfully different.” At a contentious, standing-room only school board meeting, when residents voiced opposition to the increasing role of race in education, “They told us not to clap, that they would shut down the meeting,” McHale said.

        "articles": "(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) Left-wing pundits and activists are increasing pressure on Democratic politicians to embrace the fringe position of abolishing ICE. Once an idea limited to the far-left fringes, abolishing the nation’s immigration enforcement agency now looks likely to become a campaign issue in the Democrats’ 2020 presidential primary. Former Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon came out for abolishing the agency in January. “ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,” Fallon argued. “Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.” A U.S. Border Patrol agent watches over a group of undocumented immigrants on February 23, 2018 in McAllen, Texas. The agents captured the group of Central American immigrants shortly after they rafted across the border from Mexico into Texas. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) “Should ICE exist?” MSNBC host Chris Hayes asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris on Thursday. Harris’s answer — “certainly” ICE should exist — sparked a backlash among some liberals. Liberal writer Jack Mirkinson on Friday slammed Harris for her answer in an article titled, “Not Good Enough, Kamala Harris.” “Any serious defender of undocumented people in this country would look at ICE and know that it is a cancer that needs to be excised from the U.S. Pretending that the most diseased levers of state power can be molded into something better is a useless fantasy. ICE must be abolished. Anything less is not good enough,” Mirkinson wrote on Splinter, a left-wing website. “Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020. It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition. She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization,” Markinson concluded. “Anyone else who decides to run—Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, Eric Garcetti, you name it—should be asked the same question.” Left-wing publication The Nation on Friday pushed out a similar piece, entitled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE.” “The idea of defunding ICE has gained traction among immigrant-rights groups horrified by the speed at which, under President Donald Trump, the agency has ramped up an already brutal deportation process,” The Nation’s Sean McElwee claimed. Major donor-funded groups on the Left, including Indivisible Project, the Center for Popular Democracy and Brand New Congress, now support abolishing the ICE, McElwee noted. “ICE​ is terrorizing American communities right now,” Angel Padilla, policy director of the Indivisible Project, told The Nation. “They’re going into schools, entering hospitals, conducting massive raids, and separating children from parents every day. We are funding those activities, and we need to use all the leverage we have to stop it.” “This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it,” Hayes, the MSNBC host, wrote on Twitter. He linked to McElwee’s article. Acting ICE Director Tom Homan said Thursday that Democrats are being misleading about the illegal immigrants that his agency is deporting. “Nine out of every 10 aliens we arrested [in the last fiscal year] did have a criminal history,” Homan told Fox News. “They don’t want to know the facts. They want to keep playing this political game and put smoke and mirrors up about what ICE is actually doing.” Follow Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "articles": "REUTERS/Mike Segar Florida circuit court Judge Raag Singhal ruled the Broward County Supervisor of Elections Office violated state and federal law Friday, after the office destroyed ballots from a 2016 House race for Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s seat. The elections office may also be on the hook for $200,000 in attorneys fees for Tim Canova, who brought a lawsuit against them after he lost to Wasserman Schultz in 2016, the Sun Sentinel reported. Canova lost by a final tally of 28,809 to 21,907 in a Democratic primary. (RELATED: Maryland AG Thinks Feds Shouldn’t Waste Time Trying To Combat Voter Fraud) Canova requested a closer look at the paper ballots from the race to check for anomalies in March 2017, but Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes did not respond to his requests so he took her to court, according to the Sun Sentinel. Snipes had signed off on the destruction of the ballots in September 2017. Snipes made a “mistake,” she said during testimony in court and claimed the boxes were mislabeled. She maintained the destruction of the ballots was entirely unintentional. “When I sign, I sign folders filled with information,” Snipes said in her testimony, according to the Sun Sentinel. “I trust my staff. They have the responsibility of giving me information that’s correct.” Singhal ruled Snipes had wrongly destroyed public records because her office is required to maintain documents from the election for 22 months after its conclusion. Snipes destroyed the ballots after only one year. Snipes’ attorney, Burnadette Norris-Weeks, also admitted her client made a mistake but said the ballots were scanned and preserved before being disposed of. “It was a mistake [destroying the original ballots], but the ballots were preserved,” Norris-Weeks told the Sun Sentinel. “They were scanned shortly after the election.” Canova claimed he contacted the FBI twice to complain, but didn’t receive a response. The ruling will allow for Canova to have his attorney fees reimbursed by the elections office, but he still wants Snipes fired for her role in the alleged fraud. “I think dismissal is an appropriate remedy,” Canova told the Sun Sentinel.

        "articles": "REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski (L) and Yuri Gripas (R) Leaked emails from Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s personal email account published by WikiLeaks reveal the Clinton campaign’s coordination with George Soros’s Open Society Foundations on the subject of police reform. Soros, who has given almost $10 million to Clinton super PAC Priorities USA, is a major funder of Black Lives Matter. The Washington Times reported in August that Soros has given at least $33 million to the group through the Open Society Foundations (OSF), which he funds and controls. Both OSF and Clinton have called to crack down on police officers’ “implicit bias.” As reported by The Daily Caller last month, internal OSF documents say the mainstreaming of “implicit bias” is meant to serve as a foundation from which to overhaul the nation’s anti-discrimination laws and make it easier to file racial discrimination lawsuits by eliminating the need to prove intent. A December 2015 email exchange between Podesta and OSF president Chris Stone was included in the batch of Podesta’s emails released by WikiLeaks on Friday. “Hi, John. Your policy team was asking me for ideas on police reform a couple of months ago. Here’s a concrete idea I’ve written up, and a good hook for it in Chicago,” Stone wrote. [dcquiz] Stone attached to the email an article he wrote that advocated putting federally-funded bureaucrats in charge of police oversight. “Thanks Chris. Will circulate. Hope all is well,” Podesta replied. “As well as can be. We are now officially and formally undesirable in Russia. Hope you are thriving!” Stone shot back. “From where I sit, things look good for your team.” Follow Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson Follow Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images “Never Trump” conservative and The Weekly Standard co-founder Bill Kristol donated to Democrat Ralph Northam’s campaign during the 2017 Virginia gubernatorial election, but hasn’t indicated if he regrets that decision in light of Northam’s recent scandals. Northam, who defeated Republican Ed Gillespie to take the governor’s seat, is now the subject of intense scrutiny over comments he made about late-term abortions and a racist photo that appeared in his medical school yearbook. Last February in an interview with The New Yorker, Kristol explained that he and his wife donated to Northam’s campaign after being “infuriated” by President Donald Trump’s response to white nationalists marching in Charlottesville, Virginia. In a tweet in November 2017, Kristol was publicly questioning whether he should vote for the Democrat in order to stick it to the “Trumpy” campaign run by Gillespie. Q: Vote for Gillespie who’d (mostly) strengthen non-Trumpy forces in GOP? Or for Northam as protest against Gillespie’s Trumpy campaign? — Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) November 4, 2017 The Daily Caller confirmed through Virginia State Election records that Kristol donated $200 to Northam’s campaign in August 2017. Kristol told The New Yorker that he was “pleased” when Northam won, adding, “I really could make a case that the country would be better off with the Democrats running the House, because, if the Republicans aren’t willing to check Trump, someone has to.” Kristol has waxed poetic about Northam’s comments on a late-term abortion bill in the Virginia General Assembly and Northam’s racist yearbook photo, but has seemingly abdicated any responsibility for supporting the Democrat. Kristol has not yet indicated if he regrets supporting Northam’s campaign and did not return a request for comment. (RELATED: Gov. Northam: ‘I Don’t Have Any Regrets About Infanticide Comments) “The party line vote on tabling HB 2491 in the subcommittee of the Virginia General Assembly is yet another reminder — an important one — of why many of us Republican #NeverTrumpers haven’t become Democrats but rather are doing our best to save the GOP,” Kristol said referencing the late-term abortion bill, not mentioning his Northam donation. The party line vote on tabling HB 2491 in the subcommittee of the Virginia General Assembly is yet another reminder–an important one–of why many of us Republican #NeverTrumpers haven’t become Democrats but rather are doing our best to save the GOP. — Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) January 31, 2019 Kristol retweeted a comment from Hayden Black mocking Northam’s excuse for the blackface/KKK photo in his medical school yearbook, but largely avoided directly criticizing the governor. For example, when former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley said that Virginians “deserve better representation,” Kristol spun the remark against Trump, writing, “So do the people of the United States.” In another set of tweets about the yearbook photo, Kristol joked about yearbooks gaining ground in American politics — likely a reference to failed Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore — and blasted the Republican Party’s ability to conduct and use opposition research. Bill Kristol (Twitter Screenshot) Kristol has repeatedly toed the line on supporting Democrats in his attempt to turn the Republican Party away from Trump. Prior to the 2018 midterms, Kristol floated the idea that if Democrats swept the elections then Republicans would finally have an incentive to turn against the president. “Can’t do anything about the fact that he’s president. So maybe you have to work with him. That’s been the general Republican attitude,” Kristol said during an MSNBC interview. “I think the day after election day, things change more than people realize in terms of Republican psychology and dynamics.” “They’ll need a little help from people like me,” Kristol added with a laugh. “Bill Kristol must have missed the class on party building where you are taught not to actively help your opponent while trying to rebuild your own party,” a GOP strategist told The Daily Caller.

        "articles": "WICHITA, Kan. – “Or-Man.” That was the new moniker given Thursday to Kansas senate candidate Greg Orman at a kickoff to Roberts’ bus tour which featured a couple of Republican heavy hitters in Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn. Both favorites among conservatives, Cruz and Coburn are appearing as Roberts faces the challenge of his life from the well-financed independent whose victory could help Democrats retain control of the Senate. The twist on Orman’s name was meant to call attention to what the Roberts camp considers the challenger’s fence-sitting on various issues, including which party he will caucus with if elected. Roberts has repeatedly hammered Orman, citing his past campaign donations to Democrats as evidence that he is a liberal posing as a centrist. The 78-year-old incumbent hopes to convince voters that a vote for Orman is a vote for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Cruz was the event’s main draw, with Roberts calling him “the man” and comparing him to a prairie fire. The Texan said he is campaigning for the incumbent now after Roberts stood with him last year during a high-profile 20-hour-plus filibuster against Obamacare. “A year ago last week when I was standing on the Senate floor filibustering on Obamacare, Pat Roberts was one of the handful of senators who came down and stood by my side and said Obamacare is a disaster and we’ve got to stop it,” Cruz reminded the audience packed tightly into the Wichita Area Builders Association building in downtown Wichita. Cruz also played on his heavy support among small government conservatives and the tea party. “We had a hard fought primary in the state of Kansas,” said Cruz. He was referencing Milton Wolf’s GOP primary challenge of Roberts. Wolf, who often cited Cruz as a sort of senatorial role model, left Roberts battered and bruised by hammering Roberts on residency issues. Cruz sought to bring those critics into the fold and to show up to the polls in November. “But let me urge you, if you’re frustrated with Washington, the answer is not to stay home and keep Harry Reid as the Majority Leader,” Cruz argued. “If you’re frustrated with Washington, the answer is not to empower the liberal Democrats,” he continued. Cruz’s endorsement influenced the lone Wolf supporter in attendance at the Thursday’s rally. “I will go with Ted Cruz no matter what,” said Ollie Angell, who was the only rally attendee carrying a Milton Wolf sign. “Ted Cruz could help any Republican.” Angell told TheDC that he hoped Cruz would convince Roberts to adopt a few of Wolf’s issues, such as the fair tax. According to Angell, Roberts told him at the rally that he was seeking Wolf’s endorsement. TheDC could not confirm that as Roberts had left the venue by that time. “Kansas is the stopping line where we start taking our country back,” Coburn told the audience while also adopting the “Or-Man” dig. In an interview after the press conference, Coburn, who is leaving the Senate in January, was critical of Orman’s refusal to pick a party to caucus with if he is elected. “It’s nonsense. I think it’s a scam,” Coburn told TheDC. Orman has said that he will caucus with whichever party holds a clear majority in the senate. He has also said that he would consider changing his mind on who to caucus with down the road. “The fact that he won’t speak the truth and he won’t be succinct tells you he’s spinning everything that he says,” Coburn added. The race was upturned last month when Democratic nominee Chad Taylor took his name off the election ballot, clearing the way for the well-financed Orman. An NBC/Marist poll released last week had Orman leading Roberts 48 to 38. Another SurveyUSA poll released earlier this week had him leading Roberts by five points. Roberts saw a little daylight on Wednesday with the release of two national polls. A CNN poll had Roberts up by one point. A Fox News poll put Roberts five points ahead of the challenger.

        "articles": "The lead organizer for the “Fight for $15” movement isn’t an underpaid fast food worker, but rather a well-paid labor union activist. “No I’m not,” Kendall Fells said when asked by researchers with conservative nonprofit America Rising Squared if he was paid to attend the “March on McDonald’s” he organized this week in Chicago. As it turns out, though, Fells is paid for his activist activities — and he gets paid a lot. Fells was paid more than $146,000 in 2016 by the left-wing Service Employees International Union (SEIU), according to documents SEIU filed with the Department of Labor. Fells is listed as SEIU’s “deputy organizing director.” He is currently “on loan” to the “Fight for $15” campaign from SEIU, Fox Business reported on Wednesday. Fells was hesitant to answer questions about the funding for the event and seemed uncomfortable providing details about himself. When the camera captured a shot of Fells’ face he put a hand up and said, “Please don’t record me.” “The question you should be asking is like how much do these corporations make and how much do these people make and why are they out here protesting,” Fells said, while holding a coffee from Starbucks, which does not pay its workers $15 an hour. [dcquiz] Fells originally described himself as a “supporter” of the protesters, who he said are mostly fast-food workers. “My official job is to support these people,” Fells said, gesturing towards the protesters, many of whom were bussed into the event. When asked who paid for the buses, Fells said that they have a “coalition” of “100+ groups in every city.” “They’re gonna do anything to help these workers get up and get out here,” he said. “Do you have a better idea how to get this many people out here?” “You do know buses aren’t that expensive, right?” he added later. After initially declining to identify himself, Fells finally gave in, saying he is the “national organizer director with the ‘Fight for 15,’ I helped start it in New York City. My name is Kendall Fells.” Fells previously admitted at a May 2014 event that activists chose $15 as their preferred minimum wage not because of solid economic theories behind it but because it “made sense.” “I will say that it was a pretty scientific process: $10 was too low and $20 was too high so we landed at 15,” Fells said with a laugh. He later divulged some of the tactics the activists use to pressure businesses who try to fire employees. “McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King — these places specialize in selling burgers. We specialize in fighting. So it’s hard for them to fight us and sell burgers at the same time,” he said. “So if they were to fire one of our workers or cut one of our worker’s hours, we try to have a reasonable conversation with them because we’re very reasonable individuals.” “If that doesn’t work, then we’ll bring 150 people and shut their store down day after day after day.” WATCH: Follow Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson Follow Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Democrats are in a frenzy. They’ve finally nailed the blueprint for defeating Republicans in Trump Country. “If we’re going to take the majority, it’s going to be because we win districts like that,” Texas Democrat Rep. Filemon Vela said in a Beltway news story that claims incoming Democratic Rep. Conor “Lamb’s success could provide a blueprint for other Democrats in tough races.” The Democrats, to be sure, will win seats in the midterm elections, and might even take the House, but not the way they took Pennsylvania 18. The “blueprint” goes something like this: Run a young, handsome Marine, make sure he’s pro-Second Amendment, make sure he’s anti-Nancy Pelosi, make sure he’s quiet on plans for amnesty, make sure he says he’s personally against abortion but runs like hell from any specific questions, and make sure he’s quiet about Democrats’ anti-energy agenda. Sound unlikely in today’s Democratic Party? It’s preposterous. That might not seem apparent to giddy D.C. election consultants, so of course it didn’t dawn on the gossip-mongers of Washington’s press corps, but three things –Democratic leadership, the party’s faithful, and the man in the White House — conspire to ensure this blueprint never happens on any kind of national scale. The leaders. For sixteen long years, Nancy Pelosi has led the Democratic Party. Her first partner was Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle, who voted to ban partial-birth abortion in 2003, but lost his seat (and his post in Senate leadership) to Republican Sen. John Thune a year later. After Daschle, Pelosi led alongside Sen. Harry Reid, who entered the post with a 20 percent rating from abortion cheerleaders NARAL and a 69 percent from the NRA, but ended his career with a 100 from NARAL and a perfect score for expanding background checks from the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence. Today, the two leaders of the Democratic Party, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, are far more pure than the slow, politically motivated converts who came before. Since advocacy groups began their rating systems, the two have hovered between a 0-percent and 7-percent rating from the NRA, and neither has dropped from below a 100-percent record with the abortion lobby. And the party machine has taken the cue. In 2016, the official party platform called “unequivocally” for “legal abortion.” “Every candidate who runs as a Democrat should do the same,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Tom Perez decreed the following year. The year after that, the DCCC, the party’s congressional campaign coordinator, broke with precedent and declined to endorse one of its own, seven-term Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, against a challenger from the left. Lipinski’s sin is he is anti-abortion and a member of the all-but-extinct moderate “Blue Dog Coalition,” while his challenger is an abortion enthusiast endorsed by a whole host of fellow travelers, including sitting Democrats in the House and Senate. But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee isn’t an outside, progressive organization or a single politician, it’s “the official campaign arm of the Democrats in the House of Representatives” and “the only political committee in the country whose principal mission is to support Democratic House candidates every step of the way to victory.” Unless, it appears, that Democratic House candidate strays from the one true faith. But then Pennsylvania’s Conor Lamb prepared to win a House seat in a Trump +20 district supporting late-term abortion but publicly saying he thought it was bad. As his win approached, the DCCC changed it’s tune, and a week before the Pennsylvania special election they decided to remember Lipinski and support their embattled colleague. “CONGRATULATIONS are in order for @ConorLambPA and Pennsylvania Democrats — they just made history and FLIPPED #PA18, a district Trump won by 20 points!!!” the DCCC tweeted upon victory. “RT if you’re ready to repeat this victory, district by district, all across the country!” But no amount of retweets can change the trajectory of the Democratic Party this year. Why? The faithful. Schumer and Pelosi may be in charge, but like nearly all politicians, they don’t truly lead: They follow the loudest “progressive” voices, and in the months before the DCCC’s initial decision to excommunicate, the hard-left column belching loudest was clear in its demands. “Of Course Abortion Should Be a Litmus Test for Democrats,” Lindy West titled an op-ed in The New York Times. “This issue represents everything Democrats purport to stand for.” “If the Democratic Party cares about economic issues, it must make reproductive choice fundamental to its platform,” the assistant editor for opinion news at U.S. News & World Report declared. “Progressives wouldn’t stomach a Democratic candidate who questioned the necessity of Brown v. Board of Education,” she continued, equating Christians and Hindus with segregationists, “so why might we make an exception when it comes to women’s economic well-being?” “Ignoring women’s fundamental freedoms and equality to win elections is both an ethically and politically bankrupt strategy,” apparent moralist and NARAL President Ilyse Hogue tweeted. “It’s short-sighted and dangerous to pave the path to victory in 2018 at the expense of women,” Destiny Lopez, co-director of abortion-promoters All* Above All, chimed in. “If your answer is no [on abortion], the Democratic Party shouldn’t fund your campaign.” a CNN op-ed from an attorney “based in Nairobi and New York City” read. “The core concern is that the party would errantly move away from a commitment to women’s human rights as it tries to rebuild,” Erin Matson, a former vice president of the National Organization for Women, told The Atlantic. To say otherwise, a writer for Teen Vogue tweeted, “is a betrayal of every woman who has ever supported the Democratic party. “If that’s a purity test,” a goth writer at The Guardian preached, “call me Mother Theresa.” Abortion is far from the only demand on the base’s menu. Right above its demands on abortion, the Womens’ March’s website has a list of “LGBTQIA RIGHTS” non-negotiables. In 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders nearly won the nomination as an open socialist. Democratic leaders like Sen. Liz Warren loudly call for gun-control while CNN cheers on. Pelosi stood for eight hours to protest not for VA reform, not for the opioid epidemic, but for illegal immigrants. Coal, oil, fracking and most other types of energy and industry are out. Pipelines? Who needs ’em. “All Lives Matter” is racist, men are oppressors, Republicans are Nazis, and masked vigilantes from Boston to Berkeley burn buildings and attack Trump supporters with bats and chains while the Democratic Party can barely muster a mumble in protest. Why? President Donald J. Trump President Trump has driven his opponents mad. In the coastal states and in major cities, old friends, neighbors and businesses post signs about “love” and “respect” that offer the dual function of signaling virtue while telling Trump supporters they aren’t welcome. Middle-class mothers and daughters who months before had booked non-refundable hotels and airlines to see Hillary Clinton’s inauguration parade instead find themselves donning “pussy hats” and beating drums in the street. College professors are drawing up lists of unapproved media like 15th century inquisitors. Entertainers pose with the decapitated head of the president and call for blowing up the executive mansion. A gathered congregation of working professionals and parents cheer it all. Former colleagues decry Sen. Jeff Sessions as a Klansman and a Kremlin agent, depending on the day. Liberal platforms against free trade are discarded once the White House agrees. Democratic tenets like Jerusalem-as-capitol are jettisoned once the current president agrees. Not a single elected Democrat backed tax cuts for the middle class. Newspapers from The New York Times on down have declared objectivity in the age of Trump a moral hazard. “Media critics” and “White House correspondents” from major networks condemn objectivity on wildly popular off-the-record “media” panels. Television news cheers at each new Russia conspiracy, no matter how implausible, and display no signs of shame when those inevitably deflate. A drunk and unstable former Trump associate’s total breakdown is aired for hours before anyone even wonders if there’s been a moral or ethical breakdown in the media. The first among them to wonder if it was right are punished with the type of scorn reserved for religious heretics. There ain’t no settling down. Not this time. No coming back from the brink on this race. The base is alit with religious conviction, and they will not be tolerating dissent. And even if they do calm down — and they won’t — President Donald J. Trump can whip them up in a moment. With an eyebrow cocked, and a smirk on his face.

Rand Paul of Kentucky said the FBI crossed the line with its raid of President Donald Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen, calling it a “great overstep” Tuesday on “America’s Newsroom.” “The first question we ought to ask is what does this have to do with Russia,” Paul said. “I thought the special prosecutor was investigating Russian collusion. Going after someone’s personal attorney is a great overstep I think, in the authority of the prosecutor.” “This is why I have opposed really having special prosecutors for almost anything,” Paul continued. “I think they abuse their authority. I think Mueller has abused his authority. They say. well he asked somebody else, another U.S. Attorney to do it. Yes but this is coming at the behest of Mueller.” WATCH: Paul said the investigation has spun out of control and warned Americans that this abuse of power may last well after Trump leaves the White House. “I think this investigation no longer has much to do with Russia. I would warn people around America who say oh, that don’t like the president, oh, this is just fine because it’s against President Trump. This is an enormous power used against anybody,” Paul said. “You remember what Chuck Schumer said a couple months ago? He said if you cross the intelligence agencies, they can screw you six ways to Sunday,” Paul concluded. “This is about enormous power, prosecutorial power but also power in the intelligence communities. We have to rein this in or every American citizen is exposed to this kind of abuse of power.” You can Follow Nick on Twitter and Facebook Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Horizon Air employee Richard Russell stole the turboprop passenger plane in Seattle on Friday night, flying it for nearly an hour before crashing it on Puget Sound, reported TheNYT. The outlet released an eight-minute excerpt of the approximately 25-minute conversation Russell had with air traffic controllers, but omitted a joke pertaining to affirmative action. “Hey, you think if I land this successfully, Alaska [Air Group] would give me a job as a pilot?” Russell asks one controller. Alaska Air Group is Horizon Air’s parent company. “You know, I think they would give you a job doing anything if you could pull this off,” the controller responds. “Yeah, right,” says the pilot.

        "articles": "(Photo by SUSAN WALSH/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Three months removed from the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., many Americans are still proceeding with caution toward a sense of normalcy. A strong anti-lockdown, anti-restriction sentiment has existed amongst some Americans from day one of the pandemic. They’re still outnumbered by those who align more closely with the unease of medical experts and the Biden administration, according to public polling data. Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, has stressed the need to keep restrictions in place for months. He criticized Republican governors who lifted restrictions and said his life has barely changed since getting vaccinated. (RELATED: Trump’s Health Officials Downplayed The Virus. Now Biden’s Downplay The Vaccine) ‘Slipping Into Hacktastic Irrelevancy’: Dagen McDowell Says No One Is Waiting For Fauci’s Permission To Go Out  — Daily Caller (@) April 16, 2021 CDC director Rochelle Walensky has adopted a similar public posture. A feeling of “imminent doom” still hangs over her head, and CDC guidelines for vaccinated individuals have been far more reserved than many people expected. Despite the seemingly pessimistic view offered by these officials, including President Joe Biden, they remain relatively popular with the American public. Fifty-nine percent of Americans think the CDC has done a good or excellent job of handling the coronavirus, according to an April Politico/Morning Consult poll. The same poll found 58% of Americans giving high marks to Fauci. Biden’s handling of the virus got 57% good or excellent feedback. While feelings toward the CDC have declined fairly steadily throughout the pandemic, it’s clear that Americans still generally support the leaders who are advising patience and worry over a return to normal. Data also indicates that Americans frequently support continued lockdown policies, suggesting that a feeling of ultimate safety is being prioritized over economic and social liberation. That Politico/Morning Consult poll found 55% of Americans are more concerned about the public health impact of the virus, compared to only 36% who are more worried about the economic impact. Those numbers have remained somewhat steady despite nearly 40 million Americans saying the pandemic has left them worse-off financially. Sixty-two percent of Americans believe that even healthy people — who have zero COVID-19 symptoms — should still stay home as much as possible. 37% are still mostly or completely isolating themselves throughout the day, according to Gallup. Another April Politico/Harvard poll: 42% of Americans say that even when the pandemic is over, they would like to work partially or fully from home. Another policy Americans appear to support is vaccine passports. According to a poll from The Hill/HarrisX, 53% of Americans want a government-made vaccine passport policy, compared to 47% who don’t. The Biden administration has made clear it will not be pursuing a federal vaccine passport program, but states and private businesses may choose to do so. (RELATED: Dr. Fauci Says No To Vaccine Passports: ‘It’s Not Gonna Be Mandated From The Federal Government’) Hawaii to roll out vaccine passport program by summer  pic.twitter.com/MK3PHI0KxP — The Hill (@thehill) April 13, 2021 Perhaps surprisingly, most Americans still have an optimistic outlook on the pandemic. 77% of them say the worst is in the rearview mirror. Still, it seems a significant portion of the U.S. wants to make things as risk-free as possible. Critics of coronavirus restrictions have often compared them to speed limits, arguing that lowering the speed limit to 5 mph would likely end all car crashes, but the trade-off isn’t worth it. A majority of Americans appear to believe that isn’t too bad of a deal after all. Follow Dylan on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "(Photo credit should read MIKE FIALA/AFP via Getty Images) Jewish groups are outraged that Arizona is reportedly refurbishing its state gas chambers to prepare for executions, NBC News reported Monday. “Uniformly, Holocaust survivors and their descendants are nothing short of horrified of this form of execution being utilized,” Janice Friebaum, vice president of the Phoenix Holocaust Association and descendant of two grandparents killed in Nazi gas chambers, told NBC News. The American Jewish Committee also spoke out against Arizona acquiring materials that could be used to make hydrogen cyanide gas, which is a component of Zyklon B, a pesticide used in Auschwitz. “Arizona’s decision to employ Zyklon B gas as a means of execution defies belief. While there can be no doubt about its effectiveness – the Nazis used it to kill millions of innocent Jews – it is that very effectiveness as an instrument of genocide that makes it utterly inappropriate for use by a civilized state in a proceeding sanctioned by the state and its judiciary,” the group said in a statement last week. “To think our ‘civilized society’ today in the state of Arizona would utilize this Nazi innovation, I believe, is tantamount to giving posthumous approval to the evils conducted by the Nazis,” she said. We’re basically saying what the Nazis did was OK,” Friebaum said. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey (Photo by Maury Phillips/Getty Images for Leigh Steinberg) The Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation, and Reentry said it was “prepared to fulfill its constitutional obligation, carry out legally imposed court orders, and deliver justice to the victims’ families,” in a statement to NBC News. (RELATED: Florida Holocaust Museum Vandalized With Anti-Semitic Message, Swastika) Republican State Attorney General Mark Brnovich announced in March that the state would resume executions after seven years without enforcing the death penalty. The last Arizona execution took place in 2014, when Joseph Rudolph Wood “gasped and snorted for more than an hour and a half after his execution began,” according to the Associated Press. “Gov. Ducey is following the law as it’s spelled out in Arizona’s constitution. Victims have been waiting a long time for justice in many of these cases,” C.J. Karamargin, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, told the AP. Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "articles": "Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is prepared for a potential U.S. attack thanks to a world-class war machine that relentlessly pursues the enemies of the Arab republic on sea, on land and in the air, according to video evidence currently getting wide circulation on pro-Syrian television stations. The condition of Assad’s Russian-equipped armed forces is unclear after a two-year civil war, and U.S. officials contend that the spirited and forward-looking nation has no appreciable air defenses. But pro-Assad clips show that the London-trained ophthalmologist commands a military force of such reach and power that he will inevitably achieve his father’s long-nourished dream of pan-Levantine unity under a Damascus-centered colossus. In this three-minute clip from Sama TV, a chorus of grateful voices chants the name of Syria’s army as the widely popular Baathist regime deploys jets, amphibious forces and great warships against Syria’s enemies. Courageous soldiers jump through hoops of flame while the Syrian people unite around the keywords “Homeland,” “Honor” and “Sincerity”. In another handsomely produced music video, Syria’s tanks, paratroopers, gunships and artillery batteries advance relentlessly, through snow-covered mountains, sub-tropical forests and forbidding deserts, against the terrorists, Zionists and imperialists who lust for the ancient land’s vast wealth and bounty of natural resources. The videos come as Syria faces challenges from a Sunni uprising that is supported by many Arab states and may soon receive help from the United States. The highly competitive Arab television market reflects this conflict, with many stations strongly opposing the Assad regime and even some supporters, such as Arabic-language RT, toning down their pro-regime coverage lately. But media loyal to Assad continue to broadcast evidence of Syrian strength, such as this clip from Shaam News Network, in which a patriotic song plays against images of flying rockets and infantry assaults so intense that ignominious defeat is guaranteed for all the foes of Syrian national greatness. A sense of Syria’s civil as well as martial strength can be seen in this pro-military performance by singer Rami Kazour, set to a flashy modern beat and backed by an eager crowd of Assad supporters. The skills on display could prove important should U.S. President Barack Obama, currently stymied in his efforts to muster support for a military attack, attempt to settle the Syrian crisis by arranging a dance-off.

        "articles": "Everyone in Washington fears the fiscal cliff. The White House has no interest in going over. Democrats understand they’ll never have more power than they do now. Delaying a budget deal until after January means getting less of what they want. Republican leaders, meanwhile, live in fear of another 1995 government shutdown. When two sides fail to reach a deal, the media blame Republicans. That’s the lesson Republicans learned 17 years ago. They shudder imagining the headlines if negotiations were to break down next month: “Norquist-controlled GOP forces America off cliff.” Nothing terrifies them more than that. They’ll do anything to avoid it, as Obama knows well. (Hence his advantage.) The business community fears the cliff too. Federal contractors stand to lose millions if budget cuts take effect. And nobody wants to see unemployment rise or the economy fall back into recession, both of which would likely happen if Republicans and Democrats can’t make a deal. So there’s a lot to worry about with the fiscal cliff. Congress should leap off anyway. At a full run. Face first. Yes, it’s a scary prospect. But not as scary as the alternatives. First, consider how we got here. The fiscal cliff is a creation of the Budget Control Act of 2011, one of the most remarkably one-sided deals ever cut in Washington. Discretionary spending represents only 35 percent of the federal budget, yet the agreement calls exclusively for cuts to discretionary programs, half in the defense sector. Entitlements, the undisputed drivers of the budget crisis, remain untouched. For the Obama campaign, the deal was a godsend. What might have been a vigorous debate over government’s growth all but disappeared until after the election. Obama was free to spend a full year attacking Romney as a handmaiden to the rich. Congressional Republicans had virtually nothing to say. You’d think the people responsible for signing off on a deal like this would have fled to Paraguay in shame. But no. They’re still on Capitol Hill, cowering and outmaneuvered by their counterparts at the White House. In a normal year, Republicans might be able to negotiate a deal to keep the current top tax rates in place and shift some of the cuts slated for defense to entitlements and wasteful discretionary programs. (Sayonara, Obama phone.) This is not a normal year. Republican leadership isn’t just weak in this negotiation; it’s submissive. This is Fifty Shades of Grey, the Congressional edition. Leaping off the cliff is probably the best deal Republicans are capable of getting. Hapless Republican leaders exacerbated this crisis, but they didn’t cause it. A radically progressive tax code did. Ever wonder why government has grown larger even during periods when tax rates have gone down? Maybe it’s because the average person has no real idea what government costs. As of today, the top one percent of earners pay nearly 40 percent of all federal income taxes. The richest 10 percent pay more than 70 percent of all federal income taxes. In other words, most people have very little skin in the game. A system like this is popular with the majority — why wouldn’t it be? — but it is unsustainable. When the bulk of the country has no stake in fiscal restraint, expectations become unmoored from reality and spending explodes. All of which leads inevitably to our current condition. Here’s one measure: In famously bankrupt Greece, the national debt amounts to about $39,000 per Greek. In the United States, federal debt runs to over $53,000 per American. America is now the most indebted nation in the history of the world, a country about to post its fourth consecutive trillion-dollar budget deficit, a place that owes more to creditors than the sum total of its entire economy. We are going under, for real. And almost nobody in our political system really cares. Sure, some in Congress make the right noises. But at this point there is no sizable constituency for reducing federal spending. By contrast, entitlements are more popular than ever, and most voters favor sending an ever-larger portion of the bill to a relatively tiny group of people. When Obama says we ought to soak the rich, he is speaking for the majority. Going over the cliff won’t stop this trend, but it might spur a much-needed conversation about the actual cost of government. Nobody wants to see middle class families pay thousands a year more in taxes. On the other hand, that’s money the government has already spent on programs they likely support. It might be useful for them to know that, and to consider the consequences of it. Until they do, there is no hope for spending reform. There is no question that going over the fiscal cliff would shock the economy, at least in the short run. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the combination of spending cuts and tax increases would cause real GDP to contract by a full half-percent in 2013, pushing unemployment back over nine percent. These are bad numbers, but they’re not catastrophic. And they’re likely to be temporary. The CBO found that going over the cliff would in fact strengthen the economy within a year, bringing unemployment down to 5.5 percent by 2018. Granted, by Washington standards that’s an eternity, which is to say, more than a presidential election cycle away. Republicans could get hammered in the meantime. They might even lose seats in Congress. But at least they’d have the facts on their side. That’s worth something. No matter what happens in Congress next month, regardless of what Obama tells audiences as he stumps for his plan around the country, the basic equation won’t change: Entities that spend more than they take in eventually go under. That is true for businesses, and ultimately it is true for governments, too, because math is immutable. It’s a species of physics, baked into the fabric of the universe and impervious to election results. In the long run, math is worth running on. Republicans don’t have a lot of good choices right now. They might as well try it. The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "ABC News’ Jon Karl highlighted another Obamacare deception Nov. 4, prompting White House spokesman Jay Carney to retaliate with mockery, mimicry and misdirection. Carney is having a tough few weeks because he volunteered to defend President Barack Obama’s catastrophically mismanaged rollout of the Obamacare network. On Monday, Karl cited White House memos released by House Republicans which indicate that Obama and his deputies are deceptively suggesting to Americans that they can enroll quickly in the Obamacare network via phone. On Oct. 21, Obama went to the Rose Garden to urge Americans to get enrolled via phone. “Yesterday, we updated the website’s home page to offer more information about the other avenues to enroll in affordable health care… you’ll find information about how to talk to a specialist who can help you apply over the phone or to receive a downloadable application you can fill out yourself and mail in,” he declared. “You can talk to somebody directly and they can walk you through the application process… Once you get on the phone with a trained representative, it usually takes about 25 minutes for an individual to apply for coverage, about 45 minutes for a family,” he said. But people can only register their applications via the phone. The crippled website is blocking people from taking the next steps, which include gauging eligibility for subsidies, picking a defined-benefit plan offered by a company in their county, submitting an application for the plan, and receiving confirmation of acceptance into the plan. Obama downplayed the blockages during his Oct. 21 presentation, which also featured a woman who was showcased as a successful user of the website. In fact, the woman had bypassed the critical but crippled subsidy portion of the website. To fend off Karl, Carney narrowed Obama’s “enroll” and “apply” term to describe only the touted “25-minute” registration process prior to applying for subsidies and insurance. “The whole point was to alleviate the frustration that so many Americans were having online and to take that frustration away from them and allow a live person at a call-in center to handle their questions and their sign-ups and their enrollment for them,” he told Karl. He also downplayed the subsequent stages of the long process, suggesting that the phone service was only meant to save the applicants time and trouble. “The person who calls isn’t the one who continues to wait after the application is [registered or] filled, right?” he sneered at Karl. Karl responded by quoting Carney’s words from a Oct. 21 press conference, which took place after the Rose Garden episode. “There are ways to enroll through the toll-free number, in person, as well as by mail,” Carney said after the president spoke. “You can enroll over the phone, you can enroll in person,” he said. The website “prominently features a pathway to allow you to enroll through call centers,” he said. Carney ducked, dived and dodged Nov. 4. “What I said and what everybody said… [is that people] can get on the phone and call and the paperwork is filled out for them and the process is taken over from there,” he insisted. “I think everybody else here understands what I’m saying,” Carney said. “I’m sorry I can’t say the same for you.” Follow Neil on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "REUTERS/Pascal Lauener Leaked documents from left-wing financier George Soros’s Open Society Foundations continue to reveal the extent to which the group has influenced the political response to Europe’s refugee crisis. Internal documents show OSF used $600,000 in reserve funding in March 2016 to bring pro-refugee positions into the “political mainstream.” Jordi Vaquer, OSF’s regional director for Europe, approved a $600,000 proposal entitled, “Countering the anti-migrant rhetoric and toxic narratives surrounding migration in Europe.” According to OSF documents, half of the $600,000 would go towards lobbying efforts. All $600,000 came from OSF’s “Europe Reserve Fund.” A summary of the proposal notes that “the proposed reserve fund allocation will allow for additional resources to be allocated towards countering xenophobic attitudes in Europe, move parts of the political mainstream towards more pro-refugee positions, and build constituencies around a more progressive approach to migration and asylum.” A section of the proposal titled “Unforeseen need” explains that the money is needed because of the loss of sympathy for refugees in due in part to the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. (RELATED: Leaked Soros Memo: Refugee Crisis ‘New Normal,’ Gives ‘New Opportunities’ For Global Influence.) [dcquiz] “The debate around migration in Europe has become increasingly anti-migrant both at the political and public level. In 2015, the high number of refugee arrivals and the terrorist attacks in Paris in November, have eroded much of the sympathy towards refugees that was present earlier that year.” The proposal notes, “While Germany started in mid-2015 with a widespread welcoming attitude towards refugees, by now general sentiment leans towards closure of borders.” The proposal claims that “Sweden, the other traditional stronghold of solidarity towards refugees, is facing similar challenges.” (RELATED: Swedish Police Tell Women Not To Go Out Alone Due To Migrant Violence) As originally reported by The Daily Caller, a leaked OSF memo from May 2016 argues that Europe’s refugee crisis should be accepted as a “new normal,” and that the refugee crisis means “new opportunities” for Soros’s organization to influence immigration policies on a global scale. That memo made three key points: OSF — the nation’s least transparent think tank — has been successful at influencing global immigration policy; Europe’s refugee crisis presents “new opportunities” for the organization to influence global immigration policy; and the refugee crisis is the “new normal.” Another leaked memo reveals that OSF is anticipating an increase in “migration pressures in the coming decades” due in part to “globalization.” The OSF documents were released by “hacktivist” group DCLeaks, which publishes documents from powerful political figures around the world.

        "articles": "Central American immigrant get on the so-called La Bestia (The Beast) cargo train, in an attempt to reach the Mexico-US border, in Arriaga, Chiapas state, Mexico on July 16, 2014. AFP PHOTO/ELIZABETH RUIZ (Photo credit should read ELIZABETH RUIZ/AFP/Getty Images) A top Border Patrol agent revealed Thursday that if border agents follow the law and ask illegal aliens why they are coming to the U.S. they will be terminated. The Border Patrol previously had a policy of “catch and release” that drew the ire of Border Patrol agents: “These orders are called Notices to Appear (NTA). The only problem, however, is that these official orders are usually ignored; so much so that Border Patrol Agents have dubbed them Notices to Disappear,” Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council testified. “The latest data that I have seen shows that approximately 40 percent of the individuals being issued NTAs do not show up. The willful failure to show up for court appearances by persons that were arrested and released by the Border Patrol has become an extreme embarrassment for the Department of Homeland Security,” he said. Eventually the DHS implemented a new policy that was even easier for illegals to exploit. The policy makes mandatory the release of any person arrested by the Border Patrol for being in the country illegally as long as they don’t have a felony conviction and claim they have been in the U.S. continuously since January 2014. They don’t have to have proof of this residence and just have to make the claim. “A lot of agents will actually ask them where they heard this from and they’ll tell the agents, ‘Well, I was just told to tell you,'” said Judd. He made the comments in testimony before the House Judiciary subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security. “Right now the Border Patrol has actually told us that we can no longer ask them that question, why are they coming any more?” Judd said. “We can’t even ask that question. In some cases we still do, but we are being told that you can’t even ask why they are coming.” “What do you think are the consequences for agents who are unwilling to comply with these limiting policies?” asked Rep. [crscore]Raul Labrador[/crscore]. “They’ll be terminated,” Judd replied. Labrador than asked, “So for wanting to enforce the law that is in the books, they are going to be terminated from their jobs?” “Absolutely,” Judd affirmed. He said no agents have yet been fired because the agents in Judd’s group follow the policy directives. Illegal immigration surged in 2014, and Judd said that “we’re actually seeing a lot more at this point than what we did in 2014.” He added that the Border Patrol currently does not have the resources to adequately respond. “The vast majority are coming because they understood that they would be allowed to stay, and that the smugglers are telling them and advertising in their home countries that if they get to the border that they will be released and allowed to stay for an indefinite amount of time,” Jessica M. Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies testified. [dcquiz] The surge of unaccompanied minors has also been abused by Mexican drug cartels. “Why did the cartels drive them to the middle of the desert and then have them cross over the Rio Grande only to surrender to the first Border Patrol Agent they came across?” Judd said before the committee. “The reason is that it completely tied up our manpower and allowed the cartels to smuggle whatever they wanted across our border.” Another public official who testified said that the whole country, not just border states, should be concerned with border security. “For instance, if a community in this country has a drug problem — such as the current heroin addiction epidemic and explosion of heroin-related deaths in the northeast region of United States — they have a Mexican Cartel and unsecure border problem and if a community is plagued by transnational gangs such as MS-13 and MS-18, they have an unsecure border problem,” testified Steven McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. During 2015 alone, the Texas DPS seized $646.5 million worth of drugs in the border region. The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Intelligence officials can selectively release classified information to trusted journalists while withholding the same information from other citizens who request it through open records laws, CIA lawyers argued Wednesday. In a motion filed in New York federal court, the CIA claimed that limited disclosures to reporters do not waive national security exemptions to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies frequently deny records requests on the basis of protecting sensitive national security information, one of nine exemptions written into the federal FOIA law. The case stems from lawsuit against the CIA by New York-based independent journalist Adam Johnson, who had used FOIA to obtain emails between the agency’s public information office and selected reporters from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and The New York Times. The emails the CIA provided to Johnson were redacted, leading him to question why he was not allowed to see the same information that had been given to uncleared reporters. Johnson challenged the redaction in court, arguing that the CIA, once it has selectively disclosed information to uncleared reporters, cannot claim the same information is protected by a FOIA exemption. The judge in the case appeared to find Johnson’ argument compelling. In a court order last month, Chief Judge Colleen McMahon of the Southern District of New York said FOIA laws do not authorize limited disclosure, to favored journalists or otherwise. “In this case, CIA voluntarily disclosed to outsiders information that it had a perfect right to keep private,” she wrote. “There is absolutely no statutory provision that authorizes limited disclosure of otherwise classified information to anyone, including ‘trusted reporters,’ for any purpose, including the protection of CIA sources and methods that might otherwise be outed. McMahon also said it didn’t matter if the journalists in question published the information they received, only if the CIA waived its right to deny the information. “The fact that the reporters might not have printed what was disclosed to them has no logical or legal impact on the waiver analysis, because the only fact relevant to waiver analysis is: Did the CIA do something that worked a waiver of a right it otherwise had?” she wrote, asking CIA lawyers to come up with a stronger defense for non-disclosure. ALSO WATCH: The CIA’s response on Wednesday centered on the contention that the information disclosed to favored reporters had not actually entered the public domain. As such, the limited disclosure did not constitute a waiver of the FOIA exemption, government lawyers said. “The Court’s supposition that a limited disclosure of information to three journalists necessarily equates to a disclosure to the public at large is legally and factually mistaken,” the CIA motion stated. “The record demonstrates beyond dispute that the classified and statutorily protected information withheld from the emails has not entered the public domain.” Selective disclosure of classified information to uncleared reporters is a fairly common practice recognized by Congress, which requires briefings by the CIA on such disclosures, according to Steven Aftergood, the director of the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy. Johnson’s case, if decided in favor of the CIA, could end up ratifying the practice via the courts, Aftergood says. Johnson has until March 1 to reply to the government’s motion, which asks for a summary judgement in favor of the CIA. Follow Will on Twitter Send tips to will@newsfoundation.org.

        "articles": "REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst When you dedicate your life to your country and are willing to lay your life down to protect it, nothing quite prepares you for the feeling of complete abandonment. But after Benghazi, that’s how I felt. My teammates and I were left to die with no help. Worse yet, people back home weren’t being told the truth about what happened from either our government or the media. It was all about politics, and it was enraging. There were, however, a few people in Washington who did stand up for us and were dedicated to uncovering the truth. One such man was Rep. Devin Nunes. He’s a good, honest man, and while most people were just interested in saving face, Nunes reached out. He made the greatest effort to listen to people like me who were actually on the ground fighting to save American lives. This is why I can’t keep silent when people like Rep. Adam Schiff attack Nunes’ integrity and call for him to recuse himself from his crucial work. Adam Schiff will always be the man who went on national television to say we were never told to stand down, and that we were only saying so to sell a book. To a team of Marines, SEALs and an Army Ranger, those are fighting words. Russia is not our friend, and the American people deserve to know what they did to try and impact our election, and if any Americans helped them to do it. Likewise, the American people deserve to know if outgoing Obama officials inappropriately surveilled President-elect Trump and his team to leak damaging information to the media and the public. I am 100% confident that Devin Nunes can get to the truth on both of these important issues, and frankly, people like Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi either need to be helpful, or they need to shut up and let him do his job. Oftentimes, people in my line of work are more comfortable down range where things are real, than back home where politicians of both parties play games with seemingly no consequences. To know and face real enemies who want to do our nation harm makes everything else seem insignificant, yet Washington seems only to be concerned with triviality. Devin Nunes has a hard job ahead of him, but I trust him to do it. So, let’s put aside the games and let him. Kris Paronto is a former Army Ranger, and as part of the CIA annex security team, helped to save over 20 lives during the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack.

        "articles": "The city of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, is taking a step many opponents of same-sex marriage feared would come – forcing those with religious objections to perform same-sex marriages or risk facing prosecution for violating non-discrimination laws. Donald and Evelyn Knapp, ordained ministers who oppose gay marriage, own the Hitching Post wedding chapel in Coeur d’Alene. Early in 2014, a federal judge in Idaho ruled that the same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, but the ruling was put on hold while the case was appealed. When the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, the ruling stood and went into effect. The city of Coeur d’Alene has an ordinance that prohibits discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation, in public accommodations. It does have a religious exemption, but the Hitching Post is a for-profit company, not technically a religious organization, in spite of the Knapp’s deeply held personal beliefs. Back in May, when everything was on hold pending the Supreme Court, Donald told KXLY, “I think the Bible is pretty clear that homosexuality is not his way, and therefore I cannot unite people in a way that I believe would conflict with what the Bible teaches.” The Knapps have said they will close their doors before violating their religious beliefs. But before that happens, there is another legal battle ahead. “On Friday, a same-sex couple asked to be married by the Knapps, and the Knapps politely declined. The Knapps now face a 180-day jail term and $1,000 fine for each day they decline to celebrate the same-sex wedding.” Note that jail time and the fine is per day, not per offense, The Daily Signal reports. Also on Friday, the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a federal lawsuit on behalf of the Knapps to stop the city from enforcing the fine and/or jail time. Jeremy Tedesco, senior legal council at ADF, said, “The government should not force ordained. Many have denied that pastors would ever be forced to perform ceremonies that are completely at odds with their faith, but that’s what is happening here – and it’s happened this quickly.” In May, Coeur d’Alene City Attorney Warren Wilson told KXLY, “If you turn away a gay couple, refuse to provide services for them, then in theory you violated our code and you’re looking at a potential misdemeanor citation.” With the city moving to enforce that code, ADF moved to defend the Knapps. Eugene Volokh, UCLA law professor and legal blogger at the Washington Post, thinks they have a good case. That Coeur d’Alene’s move against the Knapps violates the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Volokh, who teaches free speech and religious freedom law, thinks, “…compelling them (the Knapps) to speak words in ceremonies that they think are immoral is an unconstitutional speech compulsion. Given that the Free Speech Clause bars the government from requiring public school students to say the pledge of allegiance, or even from requiring drivers to display a slogan on their license plates (Wooley v. Maynard (1977), the government can’t require ministers — or other private citizens — to speak the words in a ceremony, on pain of either having to close their business or face fines and jail time.” Ultimately the same Supreme Court that set this situation in motion with their recent rejection of the broader issue will likely have to decide how far to take it. While the macro issue of same-sex marriage is advancing around the country, there remain a lot of micro issues yet to be settled.

        "articles": "Kentucky senator and insurgent Republican Rand Paul denounced Voter ID law during a Friday interview with the New York Times, instantly becoming the most prominent GOP opponent against the legislation that is popular within his party. “Everybody’s gone completely crazy on this voter ID thing,” Paul told the Times before speaking with a group of black pastors in Memphis, TN. “I think it’s wrong for Republicans to go too crazy on this issue because it’s offending people.” According to the NYT, Paul did not criticize Voter ID for being bad policy, but for offending voters that Paul thinks could swing to the GOP. This is a turnaround from the views he expressed at an April 2013 speech he gave at Howard University. In that speech, Paul defended voter ID laws against accusations that it discriminated against minorities. “Showing your driver’s license to have an honest election I think is not unreasonable,” Paul said, “and I think that’s the main thing Republicans have been for.” He is currently on a cross-country tour where he is visiting Democratic strongholds in an attempt to reach people outside of the Republican Party’s base. Paul also talked about his belief that convicted felons should earn back the right to vote and why he thinks that is a more important issue. “There’s 180,000 people in Kentucky who can’t vote. And I don’t know the racial breakdown, but it’s probably more black than white because they’re convicted felons. And I’m for getting their right to vote back, which is a much bigger deal than showing your driver’s license,” Paul stated. But in spite of his efforts, even Paul admits he isn’t receiving very enthusiastic responses from the audiences he’s trying to reach. He remarked that several times audiences members tell him, “I like what you’re saying. I’m still not voting for you.” Even the NAACP was not swayed by the Kentucky senator’s views on Voter ID. “But the proof is always in the pudding in terms of seeing exactly what policies and measures he might support as an elected official,” the NAACP’s director of voting rights, Jotaka Eddy, told the Times. G.A. Hardaway, a Democratic member of the Tennessee General Assembly, was also not swayed by Paul’s message and published a fiery letter to the Senator Friday that criticized both his record and outreach attempts towards minority voters. “Get real, Senator,”Hardaway wrote. “To come here, to Memphis of all places, and espouse the principles and ‘goodness’ of today’s Republican Party. Excuse me if I’m not buying it.” Doug Stafford, a spokesman for Rand Paul, issued a statement to The Daily Caller that Paul was simply discussing voter ID in the context that it “should not be a defining issue of the Republican Party” and the Senator supports the issue being left to the states to decide. “In terms of the specifics of voter ID laws, Senator Paul believes it’s up to each state to decide that type of issue,” Stafford’s statement read.

The FBI raided the Florida home of Trump-confidant Roger Stone Friday morning after Stone was indicted by a grand jury on charges with seven counts, including allegedly making false statements to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing a government investigation. The high-profile indictments were brought by special counsel Robert Mueller in the second year of the Russia collusion investigation. (RELATED: Roger Stone: I Would Never Testify Against The President) (Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP) White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded to the Roger Stone news Friday in an early interview with CNN. Sanders wondered if the same standards the FBI is employing with Stone would apply to other players in the 2016 election who have lied to the FBI. When asked by CNN about the recent arrest, Sanders said, “We’ll let the courts make the decision. A bigger question is: If this is the standard, will the same standard apply to people like Hillary Clinton, James Comey and [James] Clapper?” Clinton, former FBI director James Comey and former CIA Director James Clapper have all allegedly made false statements or been dishonest with the authorities during moments of official testimony. Sanders continued, asking, “Will we see the same people we know have all made false statements? Will that same standard apply? That’s a question we’ll see what happens on that front.” WATCH: Many in media wondered about CNN’s role in the coverage of the raid of Stone’s home. According to a previous Daily Caller report: CNN was the only news outlet to capture footage of Trump-confidant Roger Stone’s arrest Friday morning, raising allegations that they were tipped off to the impending raid by the FBI or the grand jury handling the case. The seemingly too-perfect scenario of CNN being the only outlet on scene as the FBI raided Stone’s home sparked allegations that CNN had been tipped off to the arrest.

        "articles": "(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) considers the Orlando nightclub shooting, an ISIS-inspired attack that left 49 dead, a right-wing plot, along with the shootings of police officers by anti-white terrorists. The SPLC maintains a list called “Terror from the Right,” which according to them is “a synopsis of radical-right terrorist plots, conspiracies and racist rampages since the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.” The list includes individuals such as the Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph and Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof. (RELATED: Just 13 Right-Wing Extremists Have Been Charged With Terrorism Since 9/11) However, among abortion center bombers and white supremacists are Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, Gavin Eugene Long, Luqman Ameen Abdullah and Micah Xavier Johnson. Mateen was the perpetrator behind the June Orlando gay club shooting in which he killed 50 individuals, including himself, and left 53 wounded. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before he died and was on the FBI’s radar as an Islamist sympathizer before the attack. There were reports that Mateen was gay, but the FBI said they had found no evidence to corroborate this. Omar Mateen Myspace handout via Reuters The Orlando shooter is one of two Islamic extremists on the SPLC’s list of right-wing terrorists and plots. The other is Luqman Ameen Abdullah, a Michigan imam killed by the FBI in a 2009 shootout. Federal court documents described him as a Muslim separatist. No other jihadis are included on the SPLC’s “Terror from the Right” list and the group did not offer an explanation to The Daily Caller about why Abdullah and Mateen are considered right-wing terrorists. Likewise, the SPLC did not explain to TheDC why two black power-supporting cop killers are considered right-wing. Micah Xavier Johnson is responsible for the July ambush of police officers in Dallas that left 5 dead and 7 wounded. Dallas police said that Johnson told them he wanted to kill white people and a picture from his Facebook profile shows him holding up a “black power” fist. Micah X. Johnson Facebook page Gavin Eugene Long killed three Baton Rouge police officers in July. Long claimed in YouTube videos that he was a former member of the Nation of Islam, which believes white people were created by an evil scientist named Yakub. Long also complained about “crackers” in one of his videos. The SPLC did not include two New Black Panther Party members who were arrested for planning to set off bombs during a Ferguson, Mo. protest on their right-wing terror list. TheDC reported Thursday that the SPLC’s list is light on actual individuals charged with terrorism, only seven on its list have been indicted on federal terrorism or terror-related crimes.

        "articles": "The Democratic Party’s triumph in November brought an abrupt end to the honeymoon between the GOP and the Tea Party, and now, like any fiery romance that unexpectedly turns sour, there’s a lot of finger-pointing as to what went wrong and who’s to blame. Many GOP political pundits pin much of the responsibility on the Tea Party, specifically for its role in defeating GOP incumbents or establishment candidates who would have probably won in the general election. For Republicans, partisan control of Congress and the White House is the goal, and any win that helps achieve that goal is a good win, regardless of the candidate’s ideological purity. The Tea Party sees things differently, believing that the GOP has failed because it lacks vision, which has resulted in the nomination of too many establishment candidates who cannot communicate the need for reform. And because most Americans understand the role the GOP has played in creating our fiscal problems, it is difficult for voters to trust a candidate who has long been embraced by the Republican mainstream. From the beginning, those variances in political strategy were irreconcilable in many ways. But both sides entered the marriage willingly, appreciating the potential political advantages that each side could gain by sticking with the relationship. The Republican Party, vanquished by the Obama revolution, was drawn to the Tea Party’s ability to motivate the base, viewing the movement as a way to reverse its recent political setbacks and create White House jobs and Hill committee chairmanships for GOP elites. Establishment Republicans thought that Tea Party members of Congress would abandon their drive for “radical” reform once they came to appreciate the benefits of “team playing.” Tea Party leaders, however, felt that they could change their mainstream partner for the better, either by gaining voluntary converts to their brand of reform or by forcing the establishment to abandon fiscal irresponsibility. Because most Tea Party supporters had voted for the GOP in the past, many naturally believed that most other Republicans, including GOP elites, could be rehabilitated in a 12-step program. After the 2010 election, things seemed to be on track, and establishment Republicans were willing to tolerate the boat-rocking of the Tea Party’s representatives. For its part, the Tea Party saw its strategy of increasing its numbers in both houses of Congress unfolding. But with Obama’s re-election, the establishment’s patience evaporated and the “marriage” went south. One could surmise that political necessity will force reconciliation, but this relationship may not recover. The GOP and Tea Party have serious disagreements. That’s the 800-pound gorilla that few people have the courage to acknowledge openly. The Tea Party is anti-establishment, offering a brand of political radicalism that would unravel centralized government. Its economic philosophy stands opposed to the Keynesianism long embraced by the GOP. Moreover, the movement calls for the devolution of power from any government — federal or state — to the individual. That type of devolution of government power is naturally aligned with social freedom, which explains why many Tea Party supporters, despite their private views, are publicly neutral on social issues. The Republican Party, however, certainly favors centralized government when those powers coincide with the GOP’s political interests. After all, much of the transfer of powers away from the states to Washington, D.C., and from Congress to the White House was achieved with GOP support. And, of course, many social conservatives promote centralized government when that intervention supports their norms and values. Though no one is yet seriously discussing a divorce or even a separation, the current relationship between the GOP and the Tea Party is simply unsustainable. Where the Tea Party will end up remains to be seen. Undoubtedly, the GOP wants the Tea Party to abandon its anti-establishment “radicalism.” To further this objective, the GOP leadership is likely to reward or punish Tea Party members accordingly, as it apparently did when the Republican Steering Committee voted to remove Reps. Justin Amash (R-MI) and Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) from the House Budget Committee. And as long as the Tea Party lacks real political structure, many of its members will depend on the GOP apparatus for fundraising and additional support. The Tea Party is adrift, confused by its flirtation with the establishment and social conservatism. In its early stages, the movement embraced conservative constitutionalism and libertarianism and remained neutral on social issues. If the Tea Party were to choose a separate path or greater autonomy, it would have to go further, embracing freedom in all areas, both social and economic. Additionally, the Tea Party would have to believe that it could win and would win elections, even against Republicans if warranted. Such clarity of mission would require a leader with a concise vision and the ability to help the Tea Party’s political transition. It would require an articulate leader who could explain to all voters why the Tea Party better represents their values. And it would require a consistent, effective leader — someone who is engaged daily in the fight for the Tea Party’s principles and who enjoys access to a grassroots network, independent of the GOP. The only person who could reasonably fill that role is Sen. Rand Paul. The future of the Tea Party — and possibly that of the GOP — rests on his shoulders, regardless of whether he is ready for that responsibility. Despite being Kentucky’s junior senator, Paul is a kingmaker and has vast potential to fundraise, with or without help from the Republican National Committee. Paul is rumored to be contemplating a run for president in 2016. The GOP establishment is counting on him to be a “team player” and run as a Republican, giving the establishment Republicans confidence that they can channel him in ways they find rewarding. We can be almost certain that if Paul were to run as a third-party candidate, the Democratic nominee would win the White House. And the senator surely understands this. That’s why it’s likely that Paul will continue to work within the GOP, bolstering his credentials as a team player while remaining dedicated to changing the Republican Party from the inside. That’s a pragmatic long-term political strategy — but one that doesn’t square with the spirit of the Tea Party movement. If the party’s most effective leader becomes too entangled with the establishment, the Tea Party will be at risk of becoming lost and fading into the Republican mainstream, at least in the near term. However, Paul’s future as a viable presidential candidate is linked to the Tea Party’s potency, autonomy, and staying power. In a presidential race, he would need an enthusiastic base that does not identify with the GOP establishment to propel him to a front-running position. Politically, Paul needs the Tea Party as much as the movement needs him. The Tea Party understands that America’s shared future is, and always has been, linked to freedom in all ways, in all shapes and forms. Its devotion to that most holy American principle is necessarily predicated on limited government at every level and the devolution of power to the individual. It is an ideology that appeals to all of humanity, regardless of race or gender, and it is the only principle that will allow the United States to prosper through the coming decades and centuries. It is also the standard that will grant the nation the ability to compete against the almost certain challenge from China in this century. If the GOP is to appeal to the majority of the nation’s citizens and compete effectively in future elections, it will have to embrace the all-freedoms ideology that animates the Tea Party. And to accomplish that feat and overcome the doubts held by many Americans toward the GOP, the Republican Party will need the credibility of a strong, vibrant Tea Party as its vanguard. If Paul can convince the GOP he can deliver that prize, he will be in a strong position to become a leading voice in the emergence of a new Republican Party that appeals to a broader demographic base. First, though, Paul will have to take leadership of the Tea Party. The movement needs his direction if it is to make the transition into a party of economic and social freedom with greater autonomy from the GOP. By providing that leadership, Paul will help preserve and grow the movement — and in the process, bring himself closer to the White House.

(Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images) McConnell said Tuesday that he would be willing to put a gun bill on the Senate floor, but only if President Donald Trump will sign it. This causing outrage from many on the left, who say gun reform legislation needs to happen now. “If the President is in favor of a number of things that he has discussed openly and publicly, and I know that if we pass it, it will become law, I’ll put it on the floor,” McConnell said on a radio show. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for McConnell to demand Senators come back from their August recess to address the mass shootings that occurred in early August. However, that did not happen. (RELATED: Pelosi And Schumer Call On McConnell To Bring Senate Back After Mass Shootings) “I said a few weeks ago that if the President took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I would be happy to put it on the floor and the administration is in the process of studying what they are prepared to support if anything,” McConnell continued on the radio show.

        "articles": "The Federal Bureau of Investigations removed links to the Southern Poverty Law Center from the civil rights division’s web page last week, breaking ties with the group that inspired a would-be mass shooter with its “Hate Map.” The SPLC — and the Anti-Defamation League, an outfit dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism — are no longer identified on the FBI’s hate crimes page as partners. “Upon review, the Civil Rights program only provides links to resources within the federal government,” an FBI spokesman told The Daily Caller. “While we appreciate the tremendous support we receive from a variety of organizations, we have elected not to identify those groups on the civil rights page.” But the ADL is furious — the FBI reportedly did not inform the group they planned to cancel their affiliation “We are shocked, surprised and disappointed that this would be done without any consultation with groups such as ours who have been working closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on issues of hate crime. We look forward to having further conversations with them on this issue,” Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the ADL, said in a statement. The SPLC has a torrid relationship with the domestic terrorism it claims to condemn. Back in 2012, 28-year-old Floyd Corkins II used the SPLC’s Hate Map, which lists groups ranging from the Klu Klux Klan to pro-traditional marriage nonprofits as “active hate groups,” to locate the Family Research Council based in Washington, D.C. Armed with one hundred rounds of ammunition and 15 Chik-Fil-A sandwiches, he planned to “smother in [the] faces” of his victims. Corkins ended shooting up FRC’s lobby and wounding a security guard. He was subdued by the wounded security guard and arrested before he could claim any lives — and charged with three felonies, committing an act of terrorism while armed, assault with intent to kill and transporting a firearm over state lines. During an FBI interrogation, a blasé Corkins told agents he wanted to “kill as many people as possible” and move on to another massacre at another organization on his list, which prosecutors declined to release. (RELATED: Report: Suspected Family Research Council gunman volunteered at LGBT center) “It was, uh — Southern Poverty Law lists, uh, anti-gay groups. I found them online — did a little research, went to the website, stuff like that,” Corkins said, according to released FBI footage. Corkins was later sentenced to 25 years in prison. (RELATED: Floyd Corkins pleads guilty, and there’s a reason you’ve never heard of him) The SPLC did not take down their Hate Map or their designation of FRC as a hate group after Corkins used it to commit terrorism. It’s still listed as active in D.C. A long online description sneers at FRC’s “anti-gay crusade,” and, most notably, declines to condemn Corkins with the same virulence — in fact, it doesn’t condemn Corkins at all, but merely quotes Corkins’ attorney’s allegation that his client was mentally ill. For its part, FRC approves of the FBI’s move to sever ties with the unrepentant SPLC. “Any association between the federal government and an entity that is connected in federal court to domestic terrorism should be a no-brainer; it just shouldn’t happen,” said FRC’s executive vice president, Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Jerry Boykin in a statement provided to TheDC. “Last year the U.S. Secretary of the Army described the Southern Poverty Law Center’s hate labeling of Christian groups as ‘inaccurate, objectionable, and otherwise inconsistent with current Army policy.’ We agree. We once again call on the SPLC to stop demonizing pro-family organizations simply because we stand for different values.” The SPLC did not return multiple requests for comment by press time.

        "articles": "At a Thursday Congressional hearing regarding the Obama administration’s plan to welcome tens of thousands of additional refugees into the United States, the administration’s top refugees official revealed that she had no idea whether the Tsarnaev brothers who carried out the Boston bombing arrived in the U.S. as refugees. Barbara Strack, who serves as the chief of the Refugee Affairs Division at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service of the Department of Homeland Security, was grilled by the subcommittee’s chairman, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Sessions asked Strack whether it was accurate that the two Boston bombers, Dzhokhar and Tamerian Tsarnaev, had entered the U.S. as refugees from Chechnya. “I would need to check with my colleagues, sir,” Strack replied. The exchange can be seen at about 1:48:42 in C-SPAN’s recording of the hearing. Needless to say, the Boston bombers actually were refugees, with their parents arriving in the U.S. on tourist visas in 2002 and then claiming asylum on the basis that their ties to Chechnya could expose them to persecution back in Russia. Once their parents were given asylum, the two boys and their sisters were able to also receive asylum by extension. That asylum was upgraded to legal permanent residency in 2007. In 2013, the brothers bombed the Boston Marathon, throwing the city into panic and ultimately killing five people. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed by police during the chase to apprehend the brothers, while Dzhokhar was arrested and recently sentenced to death for his role in the attack. The Obama administration recently announced plans to settle about 200,000 refugees in the U.S. over the next two years, including about 10,000 from Syria. On Thursday, the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest called a hearing to discuss the plan and whether it exposed the U.S. to unnecessary risks. The experience of the Tsarnaevs is relevant, as critics of Obama’s refugee plan argue that importing thousands of Syrian refugees could essentially import Syria’s problems into the United States, exposing the country to more terrorist attacks motivated by radical Islam.

        "articles": "REUTERS/Christopher Aluka Berry Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison is in a heated battle with Republican challenger Doug Wardlow as both candidates are tied for the attorney general race in Minnesota, according to a poll released Sunday. KSTP/SurveyUSA conducted the poll between Sept. 6 and Sept. 8 and found both candidates had 41 percent of support with 14 percent undecided, KSTP reported Sunday. The poll comes less than two months away from the midterms in November. “Ellison is vulnerable in a way other Democrats are not,” political scientist Steven Schier told KSTP. Ellison was accused of domestic abuse toward former partner Karen Monahan by Austin Monahan, 25, her son, The Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported. “In the middle of 2017, I was using my moms computer trying to download something and I clicked on a file, I found over 100 text and twitters messages and video almost 2 min long that showed Keith Ellison dragging my mama off the bed by her feet, screaming and calling her a ‘fucking bitch’ and telling her to get the fuck out of his house,” Austin Monahan wrote in a Facebook post on Aug. 11. Karen Monahan claimed to have proof through videos and recordings, though Ellison denied the allegations. “Karen and I were in a long-term relationship which ended in 2016, and I still care deeply for her well-being,” Ellison said in a press statement Aug. 12. “This video does not exist because I never behaved in this way, and any characterization otherwise is false.” Austin Monahan’s allegations prompted another woman, Amy Alexander, to accuse Ellison of abuse from 2005. Ellison denied having a relationship with Alexander. (RELATED: Keith Ellison’s Domestic Abuse Allegations Match A Similar Incident Almost A Decade Ago) Forty percent of voters said the allegations would factor into not voting for Ellison, 39 percent said it was not a factor while 21 percent were unsure, according to the poll. The poll also found 59 percent of Minnesotans did not want to become a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants, Alpha News reported Monday. Ellison has openly supported open borders. Ellison sported a shirt that said “I do not believe in borders” in Spanish for a May Day parade in Minneapolis, according to a separate Alpha News article from May 8. “Voters are motivated to defeat [e]xtremist Keith Ellison,” Billy Grant, Wardlow campaign manager, told TheDCNF. “The contrast is clear, Doug Wardlow stands for law and order and a safer Minnesota, while Keith Ellison supports sanctuary cities, and he is under investigation for domestic violence allegations.” Ellison holds a 49 percent to 31 percent lead among female “likely voters” despite the allegations, KSTP reported. Minnesota’s attorney general seat has been held by the Democrats for 47 years. The poll surrounding whether which attorney general candidate people would vote for surveyed 574 likely voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. The composition of the voters were 37 percent Democrats, 33 percent Republicans and 25 percent Independents. The poll regarding Minnesota becoming a sanctuary state surveyed 1,050 adults and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. Ellison’s campaign did not immediately respond to TheDCNF’s request for comment.

        "articles": "A chilling video of Maryland police silencing an innocent student who was recording the arrests of two other people has civil libertarians outraged. The arrests were made at night on the streets of Towson, Maryland. A University of Maryland-Baltimore County student who witnessed the arrests decided to record them using his cell phone. The student, 21-year-old Sergio Gutierrez, was soon approached by officers who objected — wrongly — to his actions. Gutierrez repeatedly told the officers that he knew he had the right to film them, but the cops were prepared to use any excuse to shut him down. First they told him that he was hampering their investigation, even though he was standing well enough away while the arrests were being made. Still, the student maintained that he was in the right. “I am allowed to film,” said Gutierrez. The cops told him that he was diverting their attention and that he had to leave. When Gutierrez persisted, they told him that he would be arrested if he did not stop recording. “I thought I had freedom of speech here,” he said. The cop’s answer? “You don’t. You just lost it. Walk away and keep your mouth shut.” Police shoved Gutierrez, told him to “shut your fucking mouth,” and eventually forced him to leave the area. Many of the people who watched the video were disturbed by the officers’ behavior. So too was the Baltimore County police department, which has launched an investigation, according to WBALTV-11. Gutierrez told local news that he was glad he recorded the incident. Police may have acted even worse if they knew the camera was off, he said.

        "articles": "(Photo credit: DOMINICK REUTER/AFP/Getty Images) U.S. officials say a months-long FBI counterintelligence investigation into Russian attempts to manipulate the U.S. election, did not bring up enough evidence to charge anyone criminally, according to a report from Circa. Agents who investigated claims of computer server activity tied to Russia and then President-elect-Trump’s businesses in New York’s Trump Tower came to the conclusion that no disreputable contacts, financial transactions or encrypted communications occurred with the Russians, according to Circa. Those in the intelligence community who spoke to the outlet appeared to be frustrated over the representation in the media of their investigation of Russia’s activities. “We have people spouting off who don’t know the difference between FISA surveillance and a wiretap or a counterintelligence probe versus a special prosecutor criminal case, and it has hurts our ability to get to the truth and has wrongly created the impression that intelligence officials have a political agenda,” said one source directly familiar with the situation. According to the report, a number of sources claimed the FBI wanted to investigate Russia’s influence peddling in the 2016 election as a result of past investigations into the nation’s spying in the U.S. More importantly, Circa’s report stresses that Americans routinely are incidentally intercepted when the FBI monitors foreign individuals like Russian embassy officials. Then-soon-to be National Security Adviser General Michael Flynn was an American who was incidentally intercepted during his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. A warrant was not necessary to review his conversations because it was a national security matter and Flynn had a security clearance, sources told Circa. The calls and text messages from last December to the ambassador were essentially holiday wishes and condolences for tragedies that had happened in Russia at the time. Another conversation, via text message about talking on the phone, was about sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration in late December. “But the message the American official gave was mostly that a new sheriff was about to take over the White House and Russians shouldn’t react to the new sanctions in a way that would foreclose better dialog in the future under a Trump administration, sources said,” Circa reported. Who leaked Flynn’s name to the media? The leaks began in January after President Barack Obama changed a long time executive order that enabled information intercepted from FISA warrants or by the National Security Agency to be pooled out to 16 other federal agencies Such sensitive information is normally given to eight top leaders in Congress, who are regularly briefed by the intelligence community about classified matters. But after president Obama changed the executive order before he left office, a massive number of staff throughout the government had access to the information.

        "articles": "Shutterstock A student at the California State University – Long Beach recently penned an op-ed opining on the racist undertones of drinking milk. In a Daily 49er article published March 13, entitled, “Milk new symbol of hate?,” staff writer Samantha Diaz writes that many Americans “have been so accustomed to hearing the benefits of milk that you probably didn’t even realize the subtle racism hidden in our health facts.” Diaz says, “It may not surprise you that the United States was founded on racism. That every institution we uphold has racist roots that are sometimes difficult to catch and even harder to fight against. This phenomenon affects our voter ID laws, state testing and, yes, even our federal dietary guidelines.” She adds, “The federal endorsement of milk in American diets contributes to the problem by uncritically pushing people to drink milk, despite the potential detriment it has on non-white people’s health.” Diaz writes that drinking milk at the level of the federal dietary guidelines may actually hurt the health of African-Americans, who do not necessarily need as much calcium as whites do. The writer also brings up internet trolls who showed up to Shia LaBeouf’s “He Will Not Divide Us” livestream to drink milk on camera. “In an effort to prove their masculinity, a dozen middle-aged white men showed up shirtless, shouting about how they need to ‘secure the future of our diet and the future for milk drinking.'” Finally, the article ends by proclaiming, “Until we recognize the racist roots in our own systems of government and fight to remove them, we are all in part responsible for the white, creamy form of racism currently taking hold in our country.” The Daily 49er isn’t the only publication to cover the pressing issue of racism in milk consumption. Mic.com published an article last month titled, “Milk is the new, creamy symbol of white racial purity in Donald Trump’s America.” Follow Justin on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Even when I agree with Rick Santorum, listening to him argue the point almost makes me change my mind. I also wonder why he’s running for president, rather than governor, when the issues closest to his heart are family-oriented matters about which the federal government can, and should, do very little. It’s strange that Santorum doesn’t seem to understand the crucial state-federal divide bequeathed to us by the framers of our Constitution, inasmuch as it is precisely that difference that underlies his own point that states could ban contraception. Of course they can. States could outlaw purple hats or Gummi bears under our Constitution! State constitutions, laws, judicial rulings or the people themselves, voting democratically, tend to prevent such silly state bans from arising. But the Constitution written by James Madison, et al, does not prevent a state’s elected representatives from enacting them. The Constitution mostly places limits on what the federal government can do. Only in a few instances does it restrict what states can do. A state cannot, for example, infringe on the people’s right to bear arms or to engage in the free exercise of religion. A state can’t send a senator to the U.S. Congress if he is under 30 years old. But with rare exceptions, the Constitution leaves states free to govern themselves as they see fit. In New York City, they can have live sex clubs and abortion on demand, but no salt or smoking sections. In Tennessee, they can ban abortion, but have salt, crèches and 80 mph highways. At least that’s how it’s supposed to work. And yet when Santorum tried to explain why states could ban contraception to Bill O’Reilly back in January, not once did he use the words “Constitution,” “constitutionally,” “federalism,” their synonyms or derivatives. Lawyers who are well familiar with the Constitution had no idea what Santorum was talking about. He genuinely does not seem to understand the Constitution’s federalist framework, except as a brief talking point on the way to saying states can ban contraception. Otherwise, he wouldn’t keep claiming, falsely, that Obamacare is the same as Romneycare. Rick! We’re conservatives! We believe the states can establish a religion — and the federal government can’t. If he truly believed in the Constitution, Santorum wouldn’t be promoting big social programs out of the federal government, such as tripling the child tax credit exemption and voting for “No Child Left Behind.” No federalist can support this man. Most recently, Santorum assailed Obama for saying everyone should go to college by responding: “What a snob!” No! No! No! Santorum’s response merely reinforces the insane liberal worldview that going to college is the preserve of our betters, a hoity-toity proof of social class, a desirable consumer product like a Louis Vuitton bag. This isn’t the ’20s, when only the upper classes went to college. These days, every idiot who can scratch an “X” on his checkbook assumes hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to make himself less employable by taking college courses in — for example — “Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame” (University of South Carolina, Columbia), “GaGa for Gaga: Sex, Gender and Identity” (University of Virginia), “Arguing With Judge Judy: Popular ‘Logic’ on TV Judge Shows” (University of California, Berkeley), “The Phallus” (Occidental College), “Zombies” (University of Baltimore), “Comics” (Oregon State University), “Harry Potter: Finding Your Patronus” (Oregon State University), and “Underwater Basket Weaving” (University of California at San Diego). My fellow Americans, Meghan McCain has a bachelor’s degree. It’s not snobbery that compels liberals to promote college for all; it’s a scam to manufacture more Democratic voters, much like their immigration policies. Is a Valley Girl who takes courses in self-esteem at Cal State Fresno (an actual course at an actual college) a finer class of person than a skilled plumber with approximately 1,000 times the earning capacity and social worth of the airhead? No. But she is more likely to vote Democratic. Encouraging everyone to go to college creates an all-new class of people entirely dependent on the government, which is to say: reliable Democratic voters. First, the taxpayer subsidizes the wasted human space teaching these moronic courses (at prices far outpacing inflation), and then the taxpayer pays the incomes of the graduates who are resigned to filling ever-growing no-show, self-paced and self-evaluated government jobs. Who else would employ a graduate with a degree in women’s studies, early childhood education, physical education, sociology or queer studies but the government? Santorum can’t be the one arguing for our side. Even when he’s asked to defend his own blindingly obvious point, Santorum manages to blow it. A few weeks ago, George Snuffleupagus asked Santorum about a perfectly reasonable quote from his book “It Takes a Family,” where he suggested “that a lot of women feel pressure to work outside the home because of radical feminism.” Santorum disavowed the quote and gallantly blamed it on his wife: “Well, that section of the book was co-written, if you want to be honest about it, by my wife, who is a nurse and a lawyer.” Mrs. Santorum is neither listed as a co-author nor thanked in the acknowledgments of the book. (Rick should read his book! It’s probably chock full of interesting quotes like that.) Then, when asked about another criticism of radical feminists from his own book, he said: “I don’t know — that’s a new quote for me.” My imaginary beagle could have defended Santorum’s book better. (The only worse quote in the campaign so far was from Newt Gingrich explaining why he denounced the Paul Ryan plan on Social Security as “right-wing social engineering.” Newt went on Fox News and said: “Let me say, on the record: Any ad which quotes what I said on Sunday is a falsehood.”) It was the same thing with Santorum on gays serving openly in the military. Again, Santorum is right — but he still manages to lose the argument. Back in October, when Chris Wallace was interviewing Santorum on “Fox News Sunday,” he fell into a trap a 14-year-old high-school debater wouldn’t have walked into, by agreeing with a quote — without knowing who said it. Wallace asked Santorum if he agreed with the following quote: “The Army is not a sociological laboratory. Experimenting with Army policy, especially in time of war, would pose a danger to efficiency, discipline and morale and would result in ultimate defeat.” To no avail, I screamed at the TV: “NO! DON’T AGREE! IT’S PROBABLY A HITLER QUOTE! SAY YOU’LL USE YOUR OWN WORDS!” Santorum agreed with the blind quote only to be informed that it was a quote from someone arguing in 1941 against blacks in the military. (I didn’t catch the segregationist’s full name … Franklin Delano something.) He still could have recovered by demanding to know if Wallace was suggesting, therefore, that the Army IS a sociological laboratory and a splendid place for social experimentation in time of war, but Santorum just shrugged sheepishly and mumbled something about how that was different. The problem is not Santorum’s conservative positions; it’s that he can’t defend them. Ann Coulter is an author and political commentator.

        "articles": "Mohamed El-Shahed/AFP/Getty Images. A former Obama administration official at the Department of Homeland Security said Sunday that when it comes to the Islamic State slaughtering Egyptian Christians, “what goes around, comes around.” In a tweet posted Sunday, Mohamed Elibiary, who formerly served as senior member of the DHS’ Homeland Security Advisory Council, stated, “Reading ISIS’s latest mag ‘otherizing’ Egypt’s Copts. Subhanallah how what goes around comes around. Coptic ldrs did same to MB Egyptians.” “Subhanallah” is Arabic for “Glory to Allah,” and so in this tweet, Elibiary is expressing praise to Allah for the fact that ISIS is killing Egyptian Christians as apparent retribution for Coptic leaders doing the same to members of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Former Obama DHS official Mohamed Elibiary justifying ISIS’ slaughter of Egyptian Christians. Screenshot/Twitter. In early May, ISIS published issue 9 of its magazine “Rumiyah,” which is the publication Elibiary is referencing in his tweet. The first article in the new issue is titled “The Ruling on the Belligerent Christians,” and explicitly praises the recent ISIS terror attacks against Coptic Christians in Egypt, also calling for more deadly attacks against Christians and their property. Elibiary referred to this call and other contents in the article as “otherizing” in his tweet. “From among these blessed deeds were the successive attacks which the soldiers of the Islamic State in Misr1 and Sinai carried out against the Christians in those lands, targeting them with killings and assassinations, and afflicting their churches with burning and explosions,” the article in Rumiyah states. “Thus, they brought upon them tremendous detriment and deepened their wounds. The last of the blessed attacks against them were the simultaneous explosions at two of their largest churches, one in northern Misr and the other in southern Misr, in the cities of Alexandria and Tanta on their holiday on the 12th of the month of Rajab in the year 1438.” The Obama administration let Elibiary go from his position in September 2014. Elibiary has a long history of controversial remarks, including statements that the return of the Muslim caliphate is “inevitable,” and also that America is “an Islamic country with an Islamically compliant constitution.” Regarding his Sunday tweet, Elibiary told The Daily Caller News Foundation in a statement: “It’s a shame Egypt & the Egyptian social fabric was destroyed to this degree by the entry of the military into politics & economics.” Follow Jonah Bennett on Twitter Send tips to jonah@newsfoundation.org.

        "articles": "Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images The Maryland National Guard may be forced to stop paying its troops and cease maintaining its equipment in the coming days if Congress doesn’t reimburse the costs it incurred sending troops to protect the Capitol following the Jan. 6 riot, according to Maryland’s top general. “To date, neither the National Guard nor the Department of Defense writ large has received reimbursement for the deployment of over 25,000 National Guard members to the District for a period of over four months,” ​Maj. Gen. Timothy E. Gowen told Democratic Sen. Benjamin Cardin of Maryland in a letter Tuesday. The U.S. spent nearly $500 million to deploy National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., before President Joe Biden’s inauguration, the Associated Press reported in February. Gowen said that Congress’s failure to reimburse the National Guard for protecting the Capitol following the riot caused a “severe cut in our budget to cover training, maintenance, and payroll for our full time Soldiers and Airmen.” “Without an immediate plus-up we will have to cancel most of our drill and annual training periods for the rest of the fiscal year,” he wrote. “In addition, we will be forced to cease most equipment and system maintenance right as we head into the height of hurricane season. Most importantly, the funding limitations will mean we cannot meet our payroll requirements for our civilian technician workforce.” Gowen warned that if the Maryland National Guard is unable to pay its soldiers and airmen on time, it could lead to a “dramatic effect on retention.” Gowen added that the Maryland National Guard will not be able to fully utilize any funds that are sent after Aug. 1 due to the way its budgetary system works. “Our fiscal systems do not allow for negative budgets to occur and so reimbursement that comes in August or September is ineffectual and will most likely have to be returned unused,” Gowen wrote. “I can assure you sending it later is much the same as not sending it at all.” Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan urged the state’s congressional delegation to take urgent action to deliver funding to the National Guard to prevent disruptions to ongoing operations. Congressional leaders pleaded with us to send the National Guard to the U.S. Capitol in January, but still haven’t reimbursed expenses from the deployment. We are calling on our congressional delegation to take urgent action to prevent major disruptions to ongoing operations. pic.twitter.com/iCyxKGEtOk — Governor Larry Hogan (@GovLarryHogan) July 20, 2021 Some 26,000 National Guard troops from all 50 states were deployed to D.C. following the riot.

        "articles": "Photo by Steve Pope/Getty Images Juanita Broaddrick, the woman who has claimed for decades to have been raped by former president Bill Clinton while he was attorney general of Arkansas, burst onto the Twitter scene on Wednesday with several explosive tweets about both Clintons. Using the Twitter handle @atensnut, Broaddrick accused Bill of raping her and Hillary of trying to keep her quiet: “I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73….it never goes away.” On Tuesday, Broaddrick tweeted about Bill Clinton’s physical appearance and said that she “was dreading seeing my abuser on tv campaign trail for enabler wife……but his physical appearance reflects ghosts of past are catching up.” In another tweet on Sunday, Broaddrick praised Katherine Prudhomme, a rape survivor herself who challenged Hillary at a recent campaign event about Broaddrick’s rape allegations. Broaddrick’s tweets come just weeks after Hillary Clinton sent out a tweet claiming that all survivors of sexual assault deserve to be “believed.” The public was quick to remind Clinton of Broaddrick’s rape accusations, which the Clinton camp has consistently dismissed. While most Twitter users welcomed Broaddrick with open arms, praising her courage and bravery, a handful did respond with hostility, calling her a “liar” and accusing her of “just looking for fame and money.” Broaddrick appears to have briefly used her Twitter account in 2009 before abandoning it for the last several years. Vox’s Dylan Matthews confirmed that the account does indeed belong to Broaddrick. NBC News also confirmed the account’s veracity a couple hours later.

        "articles": "Some disaffected conservative House Republicans are planning to rebel and vote against John Boehner for speaker of the House when the new Congress convenes next week. The official speaker’s election is set for Jan. 6., when the House will convene for a public floor vote to open the new Congress. While the vote is usually just a formality, these conservative lawmakers are planning to vote for someone other than the Ohio Republican who has been speaker since 2011. “Right now, I’ve been meeting with a small group, and we — about 16, 18 — and we’re hoping to have a name of a sitting member of Congress that we can call out their name,” North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones said in a local radio interview before Christmas, which was first reported by BuzzFeed. Though ousting Boehner is seen as a long shot endeavor, the hope of the anti-Boehner bloc is for enough Republicans to deny Boehner a majority of the vote, which would cause him to drop out of the race. These potential defectors are mostly keeping quiet about it in public, but in a posting on Twitter over the weekend, Kentucky Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky hinted he would oppose Boehner. He posted a photo of a sign that reads: “Next Speaker Please.” Such an attempt was tried two years ago, but ultimately failed: a group of conservatives tried to overthrow Boehner during the public vote, but only nine conservatives, frustrated with Boehner’s leadership, ended up voting against him. Organizers of that effort said more people had committed to vote against Boehner beforehand, but backed out before the vote. And that’s part of the problem with the plan—each House member stands up and calls out the name of the person they are supporting. Members that might be inclined to vote against Boehner are afraid to do so out of fear that others will not follow through with their intentions, leaving them hanging and looking like a fool. A conservative House aide described the current thinking among those voting against Boehner, similar to the one employed two years ago: To win the speaker’s race, Boehner needs the support of a majority of people present. If everyone in the House votes, that would be 218. The new Republican majority in the House will be 247. If 30 Republicans vote for someone other than Boehner, under that scenario, the Ohio Republican will not have a majority and the body will have to vote again until someone reaches that threshold. If this would happen, these conservatives hope Boehner would drop out of the speaker’s race and another Republican candidate would run for speaker. Some conservatives are upset with Boehner over the recent budget deal, though the conservative wing of the House has long clashed with Boehner over the last few years over a variety of political issues. During the 2013 vote, Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp voted for Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Michigan Rep. Justin Amash voted for Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador and Kentucky Rep. Tom Massie voted for Amash. New Mexico Rep. Steve Pearce, Oklahoma Rep. Jim Bridenstine and Florida Rep. Ted Yoho all voted for then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert and Georgia Rep. Paul Broun voted for outgoing Rep. Allen West instead of Boehner. (The Constitution doesn’t require that the speaker of the House actually be in Congress.) Jones, a North Carolina Republican, voted for former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker. His vote caught everyone in the House chamber by such surprise that he was asked to repeat Walker’s name during the roll call. Some of these conservative lawmakers who voted against Boehner in 2013 are believed to be possible “no votes” again against him next week. But some, like Broun, aren’t in Congress anymore, and others, like Bridenstine, have said publicly they will support Boehner this time. Some newly-elected Republican House members, like Alabama Rep. Gary Palmer, pledged during their campaigns not to vote for Boehner and have said they will follow through with their promise. After the elections this November, Republicans gathered behind closed doors to select Boehner as their nominee for speaker. No one else was nominated to run against Boehner during that session. “Rep. Boehner was selected as the House Republican Conference’s choice for Speaker last month,” Boehner aide Michael Steel said in an email, “and he expects to be elected by the whole House next week.” Asked on Monday about possible repercussions for members who vote against Boehner, Steel referenced how the speaker has said publicly that there will be no punishment for those who do not support him in the public vote. [CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the accurate number of no-votes needed to stop Boehner from winning a majority.] Follow Alex on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "New Jersey lawmakers voted in favor of a measure Thursday putting the state on a course to increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2021. Republican Gov. Chris Christie now has to accept or veto the law after a 21-18 state Senate vote in favor of the increase. The measure could make New Jersey the third state to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour. New Jersey currently has a minimum wage of $8.38 an hour. Christie has already expressed concern over the policy. State Democrats have steadily advanced the bill through the legislature since introducing it Feb. 11. Supporters could override any potential veto if they can get a two-thirds majority within the legislature. On April 4, New York and California became the first two states to enact a $15 minimum wage, following the policy’s passage in several cities starting with Seattle, Wash., in June, 2014. Supporters argue the policy can help people rise above the poverty line, but opponents warn the policy could actually hurt the poor by reducing employment opportunities. The New Jersey Business & Industry Association determined the policy could force businesses to raise their prices or reduce their workforce to overcome the added cost of labor. On the other side, the New Jersey Policy Perspective found the increase will help 975,000 state residents, including many who are struggling to make ends meet. Christie and his office did not respond to a request for comment by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

        "articles": "(Photo: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images) Lena Dunham recently criticized Hollywood for its lack of diversity, but is she being a hypocrite? [dcquiz] During an interview at the Sundance Film Festival, Dunham urged Hollywood to “stop ignoring” certain voices. “The idea that there aren’t enough diverse filmmakers or there aren’t enough woman filmmakers to give jobs to, it’s simply a fallacy and I know that because I’m here and I’m seeing the movies,” Dunham said. “If the studio system is ignoring these voices then we have a very serious problem. They are and the fact is this dialogue, and the promises that the Academy has made, is the beginning of shifting that, but what really needs to happen is that people need to take notice and give resources to these voices.” (RELATED: NYT: Lena Dunham ‘Disturbed’ By Clintons’ Attacks On Women) (Photo: Getty Images) But it wasn’t that long ago that Dunham was criticized for her own lack of diversity. The 29-year-old is the creator and star of the HBO series “Girls,” and in 2013, she was lambasted because the show’s four main characters were all white. Dunham as Hannah Horvath in “Girls.” (Photo: HBO screen grab) Dunham called it “an accident.” “I take that criticism very seriously,” Dunham said when asked about the lack of diversity in her own show. “As much as I can say [writing four white main characters] was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, ‘I hear this and I want to respond to it.'” (RELATED: Lena Dunham: ‘I’m Riding The Hillary Train Into The White House!’) The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "YouTube screenshot/Colortiniz, YouTube screenshot/Movieclips Salon’s Rachel Leah aptly referred to Dan Rather as a legendary journalist in her piece on Rather’s attack on President Donald Trump. However, Rather seems poised to outlive his legend. He has covered multiple wars, assassinations, occupations, coups and scandals — and yet he has somehow fallen prey to the myopia besetting so many journalists, pundits and those whose lives their spin has spun. President Trump apparently lacks the “noble approach to the office” taken by his predecessors. According to Rather, the 45th president lacks George W. Bush’s nobility — the kind of nobility that won for America a perpetual war (that Rather’s CBS helped sell). Trump lacks Barack Obama’s nobility — the kind that wins Nobel Peace Prize while destabilizing North African countries, arming jihadists and paying off America’s enemies. Trump lacks Bill Clinton’s nobility — the kind which involved cigars and interns. These criticisms of past American presidents are not defenses of Trump. No, they are part of a larger argument: When Dan Rather says “it’s never been this bad,” he — and we all — ought to consider why now is worse than any other time in American history. The history of the United States is replete with slavery, genocide, oppression and inequality. Why is Trump, though crass, any less noble than his predecessors who waged criminal wars, installed dictators in sovereign nations, established agencies that spied on Americans and sterilized undesirables? On account of the fact that Rather may still be a legend, I will not chalk up his hyperbole to a deference to Washington’s establishment politicians or subservience to the warehoused Clinton throne. Instead, Rather is merely a victim of a worsening trend of overreaction, ironically kick-started by news media that shored him up. When everyone and everything is perpetually turned up to eleven, it is difficult to crank out a meaningful response. Obnoxious Halloween costumes draw as much ire as a terrorist attack at a Christmas market. The promise of nuclear war on the Korean peninsula is less likely to trend than millionaires kneeling during the American anthem at a ball game. The election of a quasi-isolationist moderate president is treated as apocalyptic while the death of 65,000 Americans on account of drug overdoses in 2016 barely found room on CNN’s teleprompters. Relativism, hyperbole and partisan hackery have combined to kill any promise of a measured response to crisis and have left people with a kind of compassion fatigue — Dan Rather included. The 24-hour news cycle — given a tickertape post 9/11, then ported online in earnest soon thereafter — requires constant eyeballs to pay the bills. This is precisely why the adage, “if it bleeds, it leads” is as relevant as ever. This adage is arguably the mandate for news media’s incumbent grief pornographers. However, the difference now is that if Wolf Blitzer, Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann don’t have blood to sell. They are now in the habit of making something bleed. On bloodless days, national news outlets generate furor over the banal and the ultra-personal, turning the screws until someone gives a damn or a dram. Vampires on social media then go to work, tweeting and tumbling until everyone has an opinion on the latest sacrifice. Advertisers get the clicks they need on account of a black Santa. Jack Dorsey cashes in on the resultant manufactured indignation. After all, if there is one thing journos and their social media pimps can count on, it is that the professionally offended on both the left and the right will predictably take the bait they are given. We’re all full and choking on chum — so much so that when an actually meaty worm is on the hook, our appetite can be lacking. Thankfully, just as Facebook eliminated the need to remember friends’ birthdays, it and other social media platforms have similarly routinized and codified our responses to real news. On goes the profile filter featuring the flag of the country rocked by the latest worm, and after a period of digestion, it’s back to the chum. While certainly it has much to do with the frequency and seeming inevitability of such tragedies, the constant onslaught of emotional appeals in and by the news — mostly manipulative and insincere — makes it difficult to react to real tragedy in a way that is any different from the way we are conditioned to react to the trivial. Dan Rather may be using inflammatory rhetoric to sell some new book, but in so doing he is participating in the culture of overreaction that undermines sincere, honest and measured engagements with substantial news stories concerning events of real gravity. So far as his intended critique is concerned, Rather is incorrect in saying, “It’s never been this bad.” But where the journalistic theatrics and the numbness they propagate are concerned, it’s going to get a lot worse.

        "articles": "Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images The conventional wisdom among political scientists and pollsters is that presidential debates almost never affect who ultimately wins the White House. But 2016 may prove to be an exception. Thanks to the first debate and its aftermath, Donald Trump’s massive mid-September polling surge has vanished. Clinton, with the help of a biased and supportive media, has regained the advantage – even in battleground Ohio, a must-win for the GOP. The recent pattern is similar to what occurred before and after the Democratic National convention. Before the convention, Trump was surging into a statistical dead heat with the former First Lady. After the convention, Clinton regained the upper hand, and stretched her lead into double-digits– only to lose it again. The big question now is whether Trump can pull off a third great surge — with less than a month until Election Day. He can but only if he takes his campaign to the next level. Here’s how: First, return to the central issue of the race: the economy. This is still Trump’s most important edge over Clinton. The vast majority of the country thinks America is heading in the wrong direction, and the failure of Obama’s vaunted recovery to generate real growth and resurgence is at the core of that belief. Clinton has tried to disparage Trump’s business record and judgment, and stigmatize his policy vision. It hasn’t worked. A corollary to Trump’s laser-like focus on the economy is renewed emphasis on taxes and Obamacare. Politicians have been talking about reforming the tax code for eons. We must give business new tax incentives to invest to grow the economy, and we need to replace Obamacare which has not helped consumers and is thwarting small businesses, too. Trump has recently gained positive attention for his revised tax plan – he needs to highlight it. Second, project a strong commitment to bipartisanship. Americans are sick of legislative gridlock and the way the extremes in each party have held Congress hostage. Trump can win over wavering voters by promising to end the stalemate in Washington. Earlier in the campaign he talked about all the deals he was prepared to make. Talk about it again — even more loudly. The voters want to hear it. Third, speak about unifying the country. One of the biggest fears voters have is that America is becoming more divided by race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. Most voters believe that Obama, despite his promise to become a “post-partisan, post racial” president, has divided the country even further. However, these same voters worry that Trump will do the same – or even worse. Trump needs to do more than say he wants to “represent” everyone. He needs to spell it out: everyone in America has a place at the table: Whites Blacks, Latinos, Asians, immigrants, gay people, and men and women both. America is not as equal as we need to be. Discrimination of any kind must end. But that doesn’t mean privileging one group or issue over another or blaming one group or another for the problems we have. Fourth, emphasize transparency and trust in government. This is a huge winning issue for Trump. However, rather than try to demonize Clinton – even threatening her with jail time if he’s elected — he should treat the issue more broadly. Only one in five Americans trust the government, and in a democracy that’s a terrible thing. Government should be limited. There are too many regulations that strangle business and too much government intrusion into our daily lives. However, we need our government to work for us and to be accountable and transparent. Obama and Clinton have made it less so. Fifth, end the hyperbole. Trump has a penchant for describing the policies of the Obama-Clinton years as a “disaster.” The description grabs people’s attention but Trump too often takes his messaging too far. For example, he claims that a policy – like NAFTA – is the “worst trade deal in the history of our country and possibly the world.” NAFTA is bad, but it’s hard to document such a claim. Similarly, he frequently calls Iraq the “worst foreign policy disaster in our nation’s history.” Again, not really true – Vietnam was far worse. Language and rhetorical style matter, and Trump is losing moderate voters who would like to support him. Part of Clinton’s recurring success has been her ability to turn the race into a referendum on Trump’s character and his “temperament.” Too often when Trump scores, he scores in a way that alienates voters. The point is to win people without compromising your principles. There’s vast space to close the gap here. It’s obvious that part of Trump’s style is calculated to win over GOP base voters and disaffected working class Democrats, and to keep them pumped up to turn out in November. But Trump’s entered the final phase of the race when appealing to broader electorate is paramount. Moreover, early voting is already underway. A third of the electorate will vote before the official balloting on November 8. There’s no time to lose. Right now the biggest challenge for Trump is to make the transition – substantively and rhetorically – from anti-establishment antagonist to genuine statesman. Starkly contrast his policy agenda with Clinton’s but also show that he can rise above the fray and unify the country. In other words, “make all of American great again.” If he can do that, he can still win. The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Pasco County Sheriff / Municipal Police of Guaynabo / Days into Donald Trump’s administration, heads are finally beginning to roll at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Two notoriously corrupt employees in Puerto Rico were fired this week, indicating that more may be on the way. One is the hospital’s CEO, DeWayne Hamlin, who offered an employee $305,000 to quit after she played a role in exposing his drug arrest. “Mr. DeWayne Hamlin was removed from federal service effective January 20, 2017,” the VA said. Jan. 20 was Inauguration Day. Under former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Bob McDonald, the agency ignored years of evidence about shoddy work ethic, theft and whistleblower retaliation. The VA finally began a months-long investigative proceeding last year, after an outside agency, the Office of Special Counsel, prodded VA leadership. Even as it knew of the problems, McDonald tapped Hamlin to mold other VA employees in his image, having him serve as a “coach” at the Leaders Shaping Leaders training session in September. McDonald said the training is the number-one way to shape the agency’s culture. Paperwork reviewed by The Daily Caller News Foundation shows that bosses openly told Rosayma Lopez that she was being fired for refusing to fabricate a reason to fire another employee, Joseph Colon, after he exposed that Hamlin had been arrested at 3 a.m. in Florida on suspicion of drunk driving while in possession of pills for which he had no prescription. Diversion of opiates from VA facilities is a major issue. After ethics officials blocked that firing, he attempted to pay her to quit using $305,000 of taxpayer money, which would have been the largest settlement in recent VA history. She refused the money. Also in September, Leah Bradley, the VA’s general counsel under McDonald, told Congress that Hamlin’s attempts to get rid of Rosayma Lopez were not retaliation, even though the investigation was ongoing, she did not cite any evidence, and ultimately the evidence apparently concluded otherwise. [dcquiz] The other person fired recently is a woman who took part in an armed robbery, then kept her job while she was in jail, and continued to work in the hospital’s security office while wearing an ankle bracelet. After TheDCNF broke the story, administrators told Congress it wasn’t true and Elizabeth Rivera Rivera had been fired, before backtracking and claiming that it was impossible to fire employees for off-duty crimes. Outside lawyers ridiculed this explanation, and spokesmen at the time would not say why she wasn’t simply fired for missing work because she was in jail. She was suddenly fired Tuesday for misconduct, including being absent without leave and failing to disclose other arrests on her job application, which her background check apparently did not catch. The hospital has numerous other felons on staff in positions where that background is relevant, and the hospital has simply ignored questions about why. The precedent set this week may suggest that their backgrounds may finally be considered by the VA. Among them, Tito Santiago Martinez, a human resources official in charge of hiring and disciplining at the facility, is a convicted sex offender who said “there’s no children in [the hospital], so they figure I could not harm anyone here.” The employees union uses his status as leverage to keep rank-and-file employees who run into trouble with the law on the job. Braxton Linton is a high-level manager in charge of buying prosthetics such as hearing aids, often with government-issued credit cards. He was hired just weeks after release from federal prison for stealing $70,000 using credit card info he lifted from his previous employer. He also been arrested on drug charges while working for the VA, and it is unclear whether he disclosed those arrests to his employer. Past criminal behavior has been shown to be a predictor of future conduct. In 2011 the hospital also hired a man who had a criminal record for illegal firearms in 2007. Last year he was killed in a shootout suspected to be related to drug dealing. He was carrying his own illegal gun again, but didn’t manage to fire first. Lopez was only one of several employees who provided evidence that Hamlin had punished them for not covering for his misconduct. Within days of his taking over the hospital, his deputy said he had wrongfully billed taxpayers for moving expenses. He forced the deputy out. Records also suggest Hamlin was often missing from the hospital. In December, Sen. Jeff Flake introduced a bill requiring the VA to stop hiring felons, and to fire the ones that already work there. The American Federation of Government Employees union has refused to say publicly whether it opposes the bill. During the Obama administration, eleven sex offenders listed the Detroit VA hospital alone as their work address; some of them were fugitives wanted by local police, but the VA cited employee privacy. Rapists and kidnappers also work at nearby hospitals. An Ohio VA employee, Antoine Hall, was convicted of creating pornography depicting a 13-year old in 2014. Hall is wearing a VA badge around his neck in the sex offender registry picture, meaning he was still going to work after being sentenced, and even received a bonus in 2015. Ralph Wood was convicted of child molesting in 2006 and sentenced to five years in prison, with three years suspended. He was released in 2008 and almost immediately began working at the Indianapolis VA hospital as a clerk. David Allison was convicted of child molesting in 2007 and began working in “medical support assistance” in 2010. His five-year prison term was suspended, but he was likely still on probation.

        "articles": "REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo The Trump administration will not issue a waiver allowing oil giant ExxonMobil to avoid U.S. sanctions and resume drilling operations in Russia. The Department of the Treasury, in consultation with President Donald Trump, announced it was rejecting waiver requests from Exxon and other companies looking to restart Russian operations disrupted by international sanctions. “In consultation with President Donald J. Trump, the Treasury Department will not be issuing waivers to U.S. companies, including Exxon, authorizing drilling prohibited by current Russian sanctions,” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in a statement. Exxon lobbied the Obama administration to adjust sanctions so employees could leave the Russian Arctic. Obama granted Exxon temporary relief. Exxon sought a Treasury Department waiver to resume a joint operation with Rosneft in the Black Sea, The Wall Street Journal reported. Former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson hammered out the deal with Rosneft, a state-owned oil company, in 2012. [dcquiz] Secretary of State Rex Tillerson served as Exxon’s CEO until joining the Trump administration in early 2017. Democrats worried Tillerson’s connections to Russia would undermine U.S. sanctions imposed after the country fomented civil war in Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Congress has launched an investigation into Russia’s actions during in the U.S. presidential election, and the FBI has an investigation into connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian intelligence. Some Democrats have alleged there’s evidence the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, but none of it’s been made public. Mnuchin’s rejection of Exxon’s waiver, much like the recent missile strike against the Assad regime, casts more doubt that the Trump administration will take a softer approach to Russia than previous administrations.

        "articles": "Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) president Richard Cohen responded to the Charleston, South Carolina church shooting by saying that hate groups are on the rise because President Obama is a black man in the White House. Cohen’s official statement on the June 17 massacre at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church called the shooting “an obvious hate crime by someone who feels threatened by our country’s changing demographics and the increasing prominence of African Americans in public life.” But apparently President Obama’s election had something to do with it according to the SPLC, a decidedly leftwing nonprofit legal advocacy group. “Since 2000, we’ve seen an increase in the number of hate groups in our country – groups that vilify others on the basis of characteristics such as race or ethnicity,” Cohen said. “Though the numbers have gone down somewhat in the last two years, they are still at historically high levels.” “The increase has been driven by a backlash to the country’s increasing racial diversity, an increase symbolized for many, by the presence of an African American in the White House,” Cohen stated. Cohen then downplayed the threat of Islamic terror. “Since 9/11, our country has been fixated on the threat of Jihadi terrorism. But the horrific tragedy at the Emmanuel AME reminds us that the threat of homegrown domestic terrorism is very real.” The SPLC statement, which features a “Donate” button, is not the first time the SPLC has engaged in divisive rhetoric. The SPLC’s “Hate Map” inspired unhinged left-winger Floyd Corkins II to try to shoot up the Family Research Council in 2012. Corkins, who planned to smear his victims’ dead faces with Chic-fil-A sandwiches, was apprehended after wounding a heroic security guard at the conservative group’s Washington, D.C. headquarters. An SPLC report last year warned of the rise of “far-right extremists” who oppose the Common Core school reform standards. The SPLC also placed conservative commentator Dr. Ben Carson on its “Extremist Watch List.” Dylann Storm Roof, 21, is currently in custody, suspected of perpetrating the church shooting.

        "articles": "A Democratic member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi is calling for an end to the investigative body, but Republicans are hitting back hard, pointing out that the lawmaker, Adam Schiff, has largely served “in absentia,” attending only one of 45 interviews the committee has conducted. Schiff, from California, issued the call to disband the committee in a New York Times op-ed published on Friday. He claimed that the panel has lost sight of it purpose of investigating the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and is now focused only on taking down former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “The committee is solely concerned with damaging her candidacy, searching for something, anything, that can be insinuated against her,” Schiff wrote in the op-ed. But Republicans questioned how Schiff could make such a plea given that he’s rarely around to observe the committee’s work. “It is interesting he made this call considering Mr. Schiff himself has only attended one of the more-than-45 interviews conducted to date by the Select Committee on Benghazi,” Jamal Ware, a spokesman for committee Republicans said in a statement on Friday. “In fact, save for voting no to create the committee and then attending a press event on the now well-disproven Democrat talking point that all has been ‘asked and answered,’ Mr. Schiff has largely been a Member of the committee in absentia.” Democrats and Republicans have battled over the direction of the committee since it was formed last year. Schiff, like nearly all House Democrats, voted against setting it up in the first place. “Whatever their original purpose, the Select Committee’s leaders appear no longer to have any interest in Benghazi, except as the tragic events of that day may be used as a cudgel against the likely Democratic nominee for president,” Schiff wrote in his op-ed. While Republicans have long questioned decisions made by Clinton and her State Department aides before and after the Benghazi attack, which left four Americans dead, the Benghazi Committee took a new direction when it discovered that Clinton used an off-the-books email account during her time in office. That discovery, which Ware notes would not have come about without the committee, has ballooned into a scandal in which the FBI is involved. Meanwhile, the committee has interviewed several of Clinton’s aides and associates. Clinton herself is scheduled to testify publicly next month. Ware also noted that Schiff was not present during testimony given Thursday by top Clinton aide, Cheryl Mills. He also slammed Democrats for leaking information about that testimony. “Perhaps Mr. Schiff could shed some light on the testimony offered yesterday by Ms. Mills — the Democrats seemed to have a lot to selectively leak about that session despite the fact that Chairman Gowdy and Ranking Member Cummings agreed to treat the session as classified,” Ware wrote. “But that would have required Mr. Schiff to actually show up, something he has not done during the pendency of the Benghazi Investigation.” Maryland U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, responded to Ware’s statement later on Friday. “Congressman Schiff’s op-ed in the New York Times seems to have struck a nerve with the Republican press staffer on the Benghazi Committee, who responded by posting a bizarre, highly defensive, and erratic statement overflowing with false claims,” Cummings said. In particular, he disputed Ware’s claim that he and Gowdy agreed that Mills’ interview would be treated as classified. This post has been updated with Cummings’ statement.

According to The Daily News, NYPD officers shook their heads and glared at Lopez Rivera and Mark Viverito when the float rolled by. One officer who remained anonymous told the Daily News, “I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t working. We gotta do our jobs man.” A parade attendee from the Bronx told the Post that he was upset about Lopez Rivera. [dcquiz] “This really pisses me off,” seethed Mark Rivera, 38. “This is a day for honoring the republic of Puerto Rico, not honoring a terrorist. This man has no place in our parade. He makes me ashamed to be a Puerto Rican.” Joe Connor, whose father, Frank Connor, was killed by an FALN planted bomb blast at New York’s Franuces Tavern, told The Daily Caller, “For Melissa Mark Viverito to honor Lopez as a Freedom Hero is insane and reprehensible. Just today 97 percent of Puerto Ricans voted FOR statehood and never, even in Lopez’s day did more than 5% ever voted for independence.” Connor went on to say, “He never had the support of PR people and never intended to free them but to enslave them in a Cuban like Marxist state. His comrade William Morales and others like BLA cop killer Joanne Chesimard remain under Cuban safe harbor. He praises Cuba and receives praise from Castro. I have more distain for politicians like the Clintons, Eric Holder, deBlasio, Obama, Gutierrez and Viverito than I do even for the terrorist himself. We place our trust in our elected and appointed officials yet they betray us by first releasing and now honoring a sworn terrorist like Lopez.” He added, “Bottom line is that these politicians marched with and honored a sworn terrorist whose faln attacked and murdered in our city. That is unforgivable. These politicians must politically pay for their betrayals.” Follow Kerry On Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Two FBI officials who worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation exchanged text messages last year in which they appear to have discussed ways to prevent Donald Trump from being elected president. “I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way [Trump] gets elected — but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk,” FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok wrote in a cryptic text message to Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer and his mistress. “It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40,” Strzok wrote in the text, dated Aug. 15, 2016. Andy is likely Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. The text message is one of 375 released Tuesday night ahead of a House Judiciary Committee hearing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. (RELATED: Strzok Called Trump An ‘Idiot’ In Text To Fellow Mueller Investigator) Several congressional panels have sought the text messages since their existence was revealed earlier this month. Strzok, who was a top investigator on both the Trump investigation and the Clinton email probe, was kicked off of Mueller’s team over the summer after the text messages were discovered. It remains unclear why the existence of the texts was not disclosed until nearly four months after Strzok was removed from the Mueller investigation. Strzok and Page’s exchanges show a deep disdain for Trump and admiration for Clinton. In a text sent on Oct. 20, 2016, Strzok called the Republican a “f*cking idiot.” In on Aug. 6 text, Strzok responded to an article shared by Page by replying, “F Trump.” The pair exchanged another cryptic text message that same day. “Maybe you’re meant to stay where you are because you’re meant to protect the country from that menace,” Page wrote. “I can protect our country at many levels, not sure if that helps,” Strzok replied. Like many of the exchanges, the full context of the message is not entirely clear. Strzok also offered praise for Clinton while suggesting that he planned to vote for her. In a March 2, 2016 text Strzok said he would likely vote for Clinton. In another exchange he wrote that if Trump won the Republican primary, Clinton would likely win the presidency. “God Hillary should win 100,000,000 – 0,” he told Page. Strzok also congratulated Page after Clinton clinched the Democratic party nomination. “Congrats on a woman nominated for President in a major party! About damn time!” he wrote in a July 26, 2016 text. While he was praising Clinton, Strzok was working at the center of the investigation into the Democrat’s use of a private email server. He emailed Clinton on July 2, 2016 — three days before then-FBI Director James Comey cleared her of criminal wrongdoing. (RELATED: FBI Agent Praised Hillary Clinton While Leading Email Investigation) In the weeks before and after his politically-charged texts, Strzok interviewed several Clinton aides who sent and received classified emails that ended up on Clinton’s email server. Two of those aides were Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. Both appear to have provided misleading responses to questions about their awareness of Clinton’s use of a private server. But despite their false statements, neither Abedin nor Mills were charged with lying to the FBI. (RELATED: Clinton Aides Went Unpunished Despite Giving Misleading Statements In FBI Interview) That’s in contrast with another Strzok interview subject: Retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn. Strzok interviewed the then-national security adviser at the White House on Jan. 24 regarding Flynn’s conversations during the presidential transition period with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to the FBI during that interview. Strzok was picked to oversee the Russia investigation at the end of July 2016, several weeks after the Clinton probe ended.

        "articles": "Former Senator Rick Santorum said part of his reasoning for supporting Arlen Specter’s bid for Senate in 2004 was a conversation with him about supporting the president’s nominees to the Supreme Court, but Spector says that conversation never took place. Speaking to MSNBC’s Chuck Todd, Specter said the topic didn’t come up until after he had been re-elected, in a discussion over his chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee. “That is flatly not true,” Specter said. “We never had any such conversation. It would be improper to make a commitment on a vote before I knew who the nominee was and whether I thought the nominee was qualified. I’ve got a very strong reputation and a record behind that did not make deals like that.” Romney attacked Santorum for supporting Specter over conservative darling and now Senator Pat Toomey during Wednesday night’s debate. Santorum defended himself, saying that at the time, Specter was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Santorum was concerned about making sure that conservative nominees were appointed to fill upcoming vacancies on the Supreme Court. “He asked me to support him,” Santorum recounted. “I said will you support the president’s nominees? We had a 51/49 majority in the Senate. He said I’ll support the president’s nominees as chairman. Every nominee Arlen Specter supported from the time he — he took on Judge Forks and saved Justice Thomas. Every nominee he supported, passed. Why? Because it gave Democrats cover to vote for it and it gave Republican moderates cover to vote for it.” Specter, who is pro-choice, remains unpopular for switching to the Democratic Party, and Santorum’s comments did not go over well, seen as evidence of the Washington back room deals the Republican base, and Republican freshman class, despise. The Romney campaign doubled down on the attack, releasing a web video Friday that show Santorum’s remarks on the subject. “The fact is Arlen Spector did support and vote for Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito just like Rick Santorum said,” Santorum Communications Director Hogan Gidley emailed in response. “Judicial appointments are critical and Rick Santorum worked with the Republican team to ensure two 30 year conservative appointments to the Supreme Court – while Mitt Romney used his Gubernatorial power to appoint liberal activists [sic] judges who would support his [Romney] decision to approve 189 marriage licenses for gay and lesbian couples.” Follow Alexis on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "(REUTERS/Jason Miczek) The past several days have seen the reappearance of a trend that is becoming as common in American life as school shootings and intellectually dishonest Voxsplainers. The formula goes something like this: 1) a black man, usually while engaged in a criminal act is shot and killed by a police officer 2) said black man’s name becomes an instant hashtag on social media 3) Soros funded agitators (sometimes referred to as Black Lives Matter) descend on the city in question and begin to foment “protests” 4) Chaos ensues as said “protest” quickly descends into an orgy of looting, burning and random acts of violence against innocent passers-by. One of the most interesting facets of this story is that, at least in the cases that led to full-scale rioting (Ferguson, Milwaukee, Charlotte etc) the alleged victim tended to actually be the guilty party. In Ferguson, Michael Brown, who had all but been sainted by the Black Lives Matter cult, turned out to be precisely the aggressive criminal that the Officer in question Darren Wilson had portrayed him as. An Investigation by the Department of Justice, led by Eric Holder, himself certainly no friend to “racist” police, concluded that “there was no evidence to disprove Wilson’s testimony that he feared for his safety”. The day of his shooting, Brown after violently robbing a convenience store proceeded to begin walking down the middle of a city street after which he was approached by Officer Wilson. Brown proceeded to lean into Wilson’s car window, punch him repeatedly in the face and then reach for his gun. This sequence of events has been verified not only by witnesses at the scene but by physical evidence as well. Thus, it seems not only that the violent riots that engulfed Ferguson were entirely without justification, but that Brown’s shooting was, not only justifiable but in fact a commendable act of heroism on the part of Officer Wilson. An act, that in most sane societies, would be considered worthy of praise and recognition. Likewise in Charlotte, police shot and killed a man who they claimed had charged them while armed with a handgun. The man’s family claimed he had been merely clutching a book (Chaucer perhaps?) and had been needlessly murdered in cold blood by police who were apparently just in the mood to kill a black man that day. Unsurprisingly, according to the available evidence, it appears it was the officers who had been telling the truth. What can we conclude from such events? Perhaps the most obvious is that these riots are not actually about protesting police brutality, or for that matter, anything really. As the events that supposedly triggered them turned out to be completely justified acts of force by the police in the service of preserving public order. The truth is that these events merely serve as an excuse for rioters to enjoy the Caligulan thrill of mob violence. The official line has been that these outbursts of criminality have been merely the result of the pent up frustration of the black community which has had to endure years of “systematic racism.” Thus, random acts of violence are, if not explicitly condoned, at least understandable and therefore tacitly approved of. Well-meaning conservatives will frequently respond with rejoinders which point out the obscene rate of black-on-black homicides, or perhaps point out the discriminatory nature of the slogan “black lives matter” when in fact all lives should matter. These attempts at rebutting the various absurdities put forward by the BLM movement and their fellow travelers in the media tend to miss the point, however. The primary contention of BLM ideologues is that black communities cannot be held responsible for these pathologies, as they are entirely products of the historical legacy of “White Supremacy.” As the black writer, and darling of the liberal intelligentsia, Ta-Nehisi Coates explained: “The policy of America has been, for most of its history, white supremacy. The high rates of violence in black neighborhoods do not exist outside of these facts—they evidence them.” It is here we find the premise upon which the BLM worldview is based, that due to the all-pervasive reality of “White Supremacy” the black community bears absolutely no moral responsibility for the content of its culture or the criminal propensity of its young people. All of the ills affecting black society can be understood solely as the fault of “White Supremacy.” The genius of this concept of “White Supremacy,” is that it remains both nebulous and unfalsifiable, existing everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. Thus when asked for a contemporary example of “institutional racism,” such as historical Jim Crow laws, etc, the BLM enthusiast will point to the higher rate of black incarceration (incarceration has been referred to as “The New Jim Crow”) in comparison to other racial groups. The obvious rejoinder to this is to point out that the higher rate of black incarceration is simply due to the higher rates of criminal offenses committed by blacks ( as illustrated by Barry Latzar in his February article for The Wall Street Journal). The BLM enthusiast in question will then respond that these higher offense rates are themselves the product of the historical legacy of “White Supremacy,” and thus “White Supremacy” is the sole cause of this criminality. When faced with this sort of circular logic, it becomes evident that further dialogue is a futile endeavor. For even if their premise, which remains dubious, is correct, it would not follow that blacks, therefore, are merely pawns of historical forces beyond their control and thus possess no moral agency of their own. At the end of the day, these arguments are little more than unserious assertions and serve as apologies for acts of lawlessness based upon the specter of eternal black victimhood. Until the purveyors of this incendiary propaganda, which serves no purpose other than to sow discord, are excluded, no honest conversation concerning improving race relations will be able to take place. A conversation which, given the events of recent weeks, desperately needs to take place. P.T.

        "articles": "(REUTERS/Mal Langsdon) A prominent glaciologist is facing criminal charges in Argentina after he released a glacier survey that angered environmental activists because it didn’t result in the closing of a gold mine. A federal judge charged Ricardo Villalba, who headed the Institute of Snow, Ice and Environmental Research (IANIGLA), with “abusing his authority and violating his duty as a civil servant,” Nature.com reported. The charges stem from a lawsuit brought by Argentine environmentalists who claim Villalba’s 2011 glacier survey “did not comply with a law enacted in 2010 that was designed to give extra protections to Argentina’s glaciers,” Nature.com reported. The court put a $300,000 lien on his property. Environmentalists allege Villalba rigged the glacier survey to favor mining interests, but the glaciologist denied the charges. In fact, scientists overwhelmingly support Villalba in the case, saying it’s a politically motivated witch hunt. “There was no intention to favor mining companies,” Villalba told ScienceInsider. “No Argentinian institution has done more to safeguard and protect glaciers than IANIGLA.” Villalba’s survey included glaciers of one hectare, about 2.5 acres, or larger, that is the international scientific standard for such surveys. Scientists do this to reduce the risk of counting short-lasting snow and ice. “It’s surreal and kind of ridiculous,” Bruce Raup, a glaciologist at the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center, told Nature.com. Raup co-authored a letter supporting Villalba. “This is dangerous,” Etienne Berthier, a French glaciologist, told ScienceInsider. “A highly detrimental result could be that scientists would stop expressing themselves in public at a time where their expertise is more and more needed.” This is getting out of hand: Environmentalists get respected IPCC scientist charged because he mapped glaciers as is standard, not as they  — Bjorn Lomborg (@BjornLomborg) December 8, 2017 However, environmentalists argued Villalba should have counted smaller glaciers that would have resulted in a government audit of a mine owned by the Canada-based Barrick Gold Corporation. Had Villalba counted them, activists alleged, regulators would have audited the mine, forcing it to shut down. While shut down, there would not have been three cyanide spills in the past two years, they argue. “Clearly there is no relationship between the actual mapping and the spill of cyanide,” University of Colorado geographer Tom Veblen, Villalba’s graduate school adviser, said. “Ricardo is being used as a scapegoat, without a doubt.” When the glacier law passed in 2010, it was met with glee from environmentalists. Villalba actually championed the law’s passage, but now he’s being charged under it. Former Argentine President Cristina Fernández said the law put “excessive” restrictions on mining companies — a major force in the country’s economy — but the law passed over her objections. The law gave IANIGLA a fair amount of power, putting the group in charge of creating a glacier inventory and vetting mining investments in areas with glaciers. Scientists can even halt mining and drilling operations in glacier zones.

        "articles": "REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein Republican Arizona Rep. Trent Franks says that Robert Mueller is in “clear violation” of federal law prohibiting a special counsel from having a conflict of interest and therefore must immediately resign as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller’s reported friendship with former FBI director James Comey presents a clear conflict of interest, according to Franks, who is a senior member on the House Judiciary Committee. Federal law defines a conflict of interest as: “a personal relationship with any person substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution.” “Bob Mueller is in clear violation of federal code and must resign to maintain the integrity of the investigation into alleged Russian ties. Those who worked under them have attested he and Jim Comey possess a close friendship, and they have delivered on-the-record statements effusing praise of one another,” said Franks. “No one knows Mr. Mueller’s true intentions, but neither can anyone dispute that he now clearly appears to be a partisan arbiter of justice. Accordingly, the law is also explicitly clear: he must step down based on this conflict of interest.” Special Counsel Robert Mueller leaves the U.S. Capitol Building after meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein Mueller was Comey’s predecessor from 2001-2013 and, as reported by Fox News, has a well-documented close relationship with Comey. Other outlets including CNN have documented Comey and Mueller’s long-running history. Comey once called Mueller “one of the finest people I’ve ever met.” An AP report on Comey and Mueller said they “served closely alongside each other in the Bush administration Justice Department” and “have spoken warmly of each other,” although it is disputed that the two are close friends. Comey testified before the Senate that he orchestrated the leaking of memos he wrote while still FBI director for the express purpose of getting a special counsel appointed after Trump fired him. That special counsel ended up being Robert Mueller. (RELATED: Comey Admits He Orchestrated Leaks To New York Times) “Already, this investigation has become suspect – reports have revealed at least four members of Mueller’s team on the Russia probe donated to support Hillary Clinton for President, as President Trump pointed out. These obviously deliberate partisan hirings do not help convey impartiality,” Franks said. (RELATED: Mueller Has Hired At Least Seven Democratic Donors For His Investigation) “Until Mueller resigns, he will be in clear violation of the law, a reality that fundamentally undermines his role as Special Counsel and attending ability to execute the law.” President Trump, who has grown increasingly frustrated with the Russia investigation, has reportedly considered firing Mueller. In a June interview on “Fox and Friends,” Trump said that Mueller was “very, very good friends with Comey, which is bothersome.” If Trump were to fire Mueller, he could expect certain pushback from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Just last week, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said that if Trump fires Mueller, it “could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency.” Follow Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "urls": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/19/what-really-happened-when-marco-rubio-accused-ted-cruz-of-lying/",
        "articles": "(Getty Images) Something extraordinary happened at the Republican debate on February 13, but though it led to a heated exchange between Senators Rubio and Cruz that attracted more press coverage than anything else, nobody seemed to grasp what had really happened. It began when Cruz said: “Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama’s illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.” Rubio objected vehemently that Cruz was lying. But the transcript of the Univision program is clear: Rubio did indeed say what Cruz quotes him as saying. Was Cruz perhaps quoting Rubio out of context, making the statement seem to imply more than it really did? Quite the reverse. Had Cruz cited the fuller context, Rubio would have looked much worse. He had actually told Univision that Obama’s DACA [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] is important. He added “At some point it’s going to have to end,” but then spelled out when and why: “it’s going to end because immigration reform is going to pass.” In other words, Obama’s illegal executive action would stay in place into an indefinite future time when legislation enacts a legal version of it anyway. Far from lying about what Rubio had said, Cruz had greatly understated the point. Why then did Rubio respond as he did? Since what Cruz said was accurate, it would have been natural for Rubio to explain why he had said it, just as he had done for Univision. Instead, he launched into a series of accusations about Cruz’s lies, though it was Rubio who was lying. The answer surely lies in the fact that only one week earlier, Phyllis Schlafly’s organization, The Eagle Forum, had issued a devastating report on Rubio’s consistent record of deception concerning illegal immigration, stretching from his days in the Florida legislature right up to the present. It is an astonishing document, well researched and fully documented, and appears to leave no doubt that since running for the U.S. Senate Rubio has always loudly claimed to be moderate and reasonable on illegal immigration (border security and enforcement of employment laws must come first before anything else can happen, no access for illegals to welfare or Obamacare, no immediate legalization, no chain migration, no amnesty, etc.) while the actions he took always did the exact opposite. The weight of the evidence Schlafly cites is impressive. But what is most relevant to where we are now is the light the report sheds on the way Rubio currently presents himself on this issue, post gang-of-eight. As if sadder and wiser after his mistake in supporting the gang’s amnesty bill, Rubio now says that he has learned that before anything else can happen, there must be a fence, border enforcement, employment law enforcement, and so on. But what the Schlafly report demonstrates is that this is exactly the same PR that Rubio used to reassure conservatives and thereby get 68 Senate votes for the gang’s bill: he always understood that he could only sell it by persuading skeptics that border security, etc., must come first, before anything else (legalization) could happen — though the bill said exactly the opposite. And this fatally undermines his sincerity when he now tries to persuade us that this is his new position, one gained only by the bitter experience of seeing the gang’s bill fail. The Schlafly report carefully chronicles the way in which Rubio deceived one interviewer after another about the content of the gang’s bill: Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O’Reilly, Mark Levin and others. Over and over again, the interviewers asked Rubio for reassurance on the many questions that would be deal breakers for conservatives: whether illegals would get access to welfare, or to cash payments from the IRS (the negative income tax), or to Obamacare; whether it allowed chain migration; whether administrative discretion could override the bill’s provisions; and most importantly of course whether legalization would happen only after clear proof that the border was secure and employment laws were being enforced. Every time, Rubio reassured them that the bill was firm on all the points that conservatives were anxious about. But it wasn’t — he was lying about every one of these points. However, when speaking to a Spanish audience (on Univision) Rubio told the truth: legalization and everything that automatically came with it would come first — the minute the bill was signed, in fact — and it was not conditional on anything. Schlafly summarizes: “Rubio traded shamelessly on the affection and trust conservatives had placed in him. His deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded Obama’s claims about disastrous Obamacare.” Inevitably, people began to read the bill and find out that what Rubio was saying was completely false. At first Rubio accused them of lying about his bill, but as more and more voices were raised he was forced to change his tack: now he feigned surprise at what was in the bill that he had written, and agreed that it needed fixing. But his presentation to Univision proved that he always knew perfectly well what was in the bill. Rubio now promised to fix the bill to bring it into line with the assurances he had been making about its content, and also promised not to vote for it unless it had been fixed. He broke both promises. Schlafly documents how Rubio first obstructed attempts to fix the bill, then voted for it. After reading the Schlafly report we in a better position to understand what made Rubio fly off the handle and accuse Cruz of serial lying when what he was saying was unquestionably factual. When Cruz touched on what Rubio has been saying to Univision — one of Schlafly’s themes — he saw immediately how dangerous this could be to his credibility and so decided to pre-empt the credibility issue by accusing Cruz of lying before his own could be exposed. Marco Rubio on illegal immigration is a sorry record of perfidy and betrayal. Phyllis Schlafly suggests that such habitual lying should rule him out of consideration for the presidency. Until Rubio comes up with a convincing rebuttal of her report, that conclusion will be difficult to argue with. John M.

        "articles": "REUTERS/Adam Bettcher Democrats featured two “lifelong Republicans”onstage at the Democratic National Convention Thursday, but these two so-called Republicans actually have histories supporting the Left. “It’s an honor to be here. Candidly, it’s also a shock. Not because of the momentous nature of this event, or the size of the crowd. It’s a shock because, unlike you, I’m a Republican,” Lobbyist Doug Elmets told the crowd at the DNC Thursday night. Elmet’s website says he worked as a spokesman for the Reagan administration, as well as speechwriter. He then worked in the communications department for the Department of Energy before starting his own private lobbying firm. Elmets represents the interests of Thunder Valley Casino Resort, the United Auburn Indian Community, Jackson Rancheria Casino Resort, Pala Band of Mission Indians, Veterans of Foreign Wars and the California Business Defense. Donald Trump targeted casinos run and operated by Native Americans in 1993, when he testified before Congress they shouldn’t have special rights because he believed they were fronts for the mafia, controversially adding some of the people didn’t “look Indian.” Elmets donated to several Democratic campaigns over the years, starting in 2004. One donation in 2010 was made from Elmet’s lobbying firm to Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in Sacramento. Jennifer Pierotti Lim also spoke Thursday. She helped found the group Republican Women for Hillary in May with former Republican staffer Craig Snyder. Lim is the director for health policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an organization that criticized Trump’s trade speech in June in a social media firestorm. Snyder started his career as a Republican staffer for Arlen Specter, before ultimately donating to and voting for Democrats in the last few presidential elections. “It’s really important that Republican leaders, especially Republican women leaders, stand up right now and say we’re not OK with Trump representing our party,” Lim told CNN when she founded Republican Women for Hillary. The group had a small leadership circle when it started, but its social media influence is growing. The video announcing they planned to attend the DNC in Philadelphia earned almost 16 million views. “I’ve voted Republican my entire life. I believe in the bedrock values of the Republican Party: liberty, equality, and the idea that there are individual rights that cannot be taken away. These are values to be proud of,” Lin told the crowd during her two-minute DNC speech. Follow Phillip On Twitter Have a Tip?

        "articles": "Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan warned against becoming too involved in the conflict between Islamist and secular forces in Iraq, Syria and throughout the Middle East, urging those in power to “not send another American army into Iraq.” Buchanan spoke Wednesday with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto about the ongoing debate about the level of U.S. engagement in the fight against ISIS, the radical Islamic terror group in Iraq and Syria which has already executed two Americans and killed thousands of Iraqis. The former presidential candidate lambasted those who advocated bombing the Syrian government last fall, accusing them of “not thinking. One of two or three forces is going to control Damascus: ISIS, al-Qaida, or Assad. Now which would you prefer?” Cavuto noted that notion is why so many Americans are “leery of protracted entanglements,” because it’s often impossible to tell who U.S. allies in the region really are. “Here’s what we ought not to do,” Buchanan asserted. “Do not send another American army into Iraq, and do not send an American army into Syria. The Syrians, the Turks, the Iraqis, the Kurds have hundreds of thousands of soldiers! There’s about sixteen thousand in ISIS. They can deal with the boots on the ground, and the Americans can provide air power.” “But to send Americans in there — Neil, this is why al-Qaida is all over the world today!” he continued, implying that America’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were an overreaction that spawned the new generation of terrorists now ravaging the Middle East.

        "articles": "Officials at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, the semi-prestigious flagship school of the state’s college system, attempted to prohibit a student-led memorial honoring victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks this week by claiming that it could interfere with campus lawn-care efforts. Forceful pushback by students led the administrators to back down — quickly, reports The College Fix. The University of Illinois chapter of the College Republicans initially approached the administration weeks ago to request permission to plant 2,977 small American flags close together on the quad to honor the 2,977 people who died during terrorist attack (including over 400 police officers and firefighters). Dementro Powell, an assistant director for student programs and activities at the taxpayer-funded school, declined the request. According to Chris Piper, president of the campus College Republicans chapter, Powell claimed that planting the small flags on the quad would obstruct with the “irrigation system” and might negatively affect the administration’s lawn care efforts. Piper observed that each of the miniature flags would be pushed half an inch in the ground. However, Powell was unmoved. According to Piper, the university official suggested that the College Republicans could place the 2,977 flags in 2,977 cups of sand or in 2,977 individual cardboard foundations. In any case, the flag sticks could not enter the ground. In an email obtained by the Fix, Piper responded by noting that either alternative would “be a great cost and inconvenience.” Piper also observed that the College Republicans had planted exactly the same flag memorial on the University of Illinois quad in 2012. Despite his concerns about flags sticking half an inch in the ground on the quad, Powell also proposed that the College Republicans spread the flags out on the quad instead of putting them in a central place. The student activities assistant failed to explain how spreading the flags throughout the quad would diminish any harm to the irrigation system. On Tuesday, the administration was still insisting that there would be no centralized memorial honoring the people who died as a result of the Sept. 11 attacks. The College Republicans responded with a grassroots effort. Hundreds of students overwhelmed the University of Illinois chancellor’s office with calls demanding that the 9/11 memorial be allowed. In short order, school officials caved. Powell, the assistant director for student programs, was overruled. “Thank you to everyone that has shown such great support of our effort to hold a 9/11 memorial on the Quad,” the College Republicans Facebook page announced late Wednesday afternoon. “Your efforts have been noticed by us and the University. Thankfully, we have reached an agreement that will allow us to place all 2,977 flags for each victim on the Quad on Friday. Without your support, this would not have been accomplished.” The three-campus University of Illinois system is notable for persistently embracing terrorism. Both the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and the University of Illinois at Chicago have boasted bona fide American terrorists on their faculties. (RELATED: TERRORIST UNIVERSITY: The University Of Illinois System Keeps Hiring Terrorists) The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign has employed James Kilgore, an adjunct instructor of global studies and urban planning, a felon and a former member of the infamous Symbionese Liberation Army. (RELATED: PRIORITIES: Will University Of Illinois Employ Terrorist Murderer Or Take $4.5 MILLION Gift?) The Symbionese Liberation Army was the notorious terrorist organization that kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst. The group also attempted two bank robberies. Kilgore participated in a 1975 bank robbery during which bank customer Myrna Opsahl was murdered. Opsahl, who bled to death on the floor of the bank, was a 42-year-old mother of four. The University of Illinois at Chicago, a dismal and endless slab of concrete that is easily one of the ugliest campuses in America, was the well-known professional home of unrepentant Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers from 1987 until his retirement in 2010. Ayers, the son of a very wealthy former CEO of Commonwealth Edison, was a co-founder and leader of the Weather Underground, a communist revolutionary group. He was heavily involved in Chicago’s “Days of Rage” riot in 1969, which cost taxpayers in Chicago and the state of Illinois about $183,000. That’s over $1.13 million in today’s dollars. The Weather Underground also conducted a series of bombings and attempted bombings of banks and the United States Capitol, the Pentagon and other government buildings. In 1970, three of Ayers’s spectacularly incompetent colleagues died in a Greenwich Village townhouse explosion trying to make a nail bomb. From 1970 to 1973, Ayers’s wife, Northwestern University law professor and fellow Weather Undergrounder Bernardine Dohrn, was a permanent fixture on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives” list. In 1969, Dohrn threatened attacks on college graduation ceremonies across the country “where the big people will come as speakers.” Also in 1969, Dohrn expressed support for Charles Manson and his followers because “they killed those pigs.” Ayers fled prosecution after an accidental Greenwich Village townhouse explosion. After his days as a federal fugitive ended (because charges were dropped due to illegal FBI snooping), Ayers earned a Ph.D. In a 2001 book, he admitted that he participated in bombings of the New York City Police Department headquarters, the U.S. Capitol Building and the Pentagon in the early 1970s.

        "articles": "Fresh off its “Hate Map” that inspired a fellow leftist to go to the Family Research Council headquarters in an attempt to kill a bunch of people and rub their faces with Chick-fil-A sandwiches, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has issued a derisive report condemning opposition to Common Core as a propaganda effort by “far-right extremists” to destroy public schools. “Across the United States, a fierce wave of resistance is engulfing the Common Core State Standards, threatening to derail this ambitious effort to lift student achievement and, more fundamentally, to undermine the very idea of public education,” the May 2014 report proclaims. The report largely ignores the large number of critics on the American political left, including the Chicago Teachers Union, who deplore Common Core because it mandates evermore standardized testing. It also largely ignores the complaints of a multitude of critics on the right, who oppose a technocratic takeover of public education that wrests education decisions out of the hands of local school boards and parents. Instead, the SPLC report insists, opposition to Common Core comes from “far-right extremists” who oppose Common Core out of fears it will “indoctrinate young children into ‘the homosexual lifestyle'” and “turn children into ‘green serfs’ who will serve a totalitarian ‘New World Order.'” “The disinformation campaign is being driven by the likes of Fox News, the John Birch Society, Tea Party factions, and the Christian Right,” the report declares. The SPLC also mentions “the Koch brothers,” of course. The conspiracy theorists behind the SPLC report theorize that “the radical right” hopes to use opposition to Common Core as a proxy in a broader fight to terminate all public education for some 50 million schoolchildren in the United States. “The Christian Right is reprising themes from earlier battles over the teaching of evolution, school prayer, sex education and more recent efforts to stop the bullying of LGBT students,” the SPLC claims. “Their moneyed allies seek to privatize the education landscape.” The SPLC calls public education – in one-size-fits-all public schools – a “linchpin not only of our prosperity but of the American ideal of equality for all.” “Political leaders and policymakers at all levels must reject the extremism that has polluted the debate and focus on the real issues,” the report urges. The SPLC is, of course, most famous because a man named Floyd Lee Corkins used an SPLC “Hate Map” to find the Family Research Council headquarters in Washington, DC. He entered the headquarters lobby in August 2012 in an attempt to “to kill as many people as possible” and “smother Chick-fil-A sandwiches in their faces” because he disagreed with the conservative organization about gay marriage. Corkins managed to shoot a security guard. The guard disarmed him.

        "articles": "White House spokesman Jay Carney claimed Wednesday that President Barack Obama’s $60 billion green-tech program didn’t benefit foreign workers, even though the program funded many foreign manufacturers. The claim that foreign workers were helped by taxpayer funds “doesn’t past the laugh test … [and] is specious,” he said during the midday press briefing. Carney’s sweeping claims came a day after Mitt Romney slammed Obama as “the outsourcer-in-chief” during a town-hall meeting with a friendly audience in Colorado. “If there is an outsourcer-in-chief, it’s the president of the United States, not the guy who’s running to replace him,” the Republican presidential candidate told a high school auditorium with 600 people. Obama is “outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself, by putting money into energy companies, solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States,” Romney said. Romney’s hard-edged charge is a response to an extensive advertising campaign by Obama that is trying to portray Romney as an job-destroying, uncaring capitalist who exported American jobs. That controversial campaign has not boosted Obama’s numbers in the swing-states, where his polls are depressed by high unemployment, deficits and debt. Romney’s charge of green-tech outsourcing was buttressed by the Republican National Committee, which on June 10 produced a new website, “ObamanomicsOutsourced.com.” The administration sent overseas half of a $2.4 billion battery-development program, half of the $8.5 billion spent on wind-energy projects, a third of $2.3 billion spent on green-manufacturing tax breaks and at least $2.7 billion in federal-backed loans, according to the RNC site. Melanie Roussell, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, admitted that green-tech work was done by overseas workers. “In some of these case, the components for these projects were built in other countries,” she told KPCC, a public radio station in California. When asked about the GOP’s charges, Carney said the administration’s green-tech spending did hire some American workers and will boost national security. But he also tried to avoid answering the GOP’s charges. “There is an element here of ‘I know you are but what am I,’ to this charge, but the facts tell a different story,” he said. “The [2009] Recovery Act [stimulus] helped create new industries in this country… including the advanced battery industry… the investments in those industries helped funds thousands and thousands of jobs,” he said. Since 2009, numerous green-tech companies have laid off workers or shut their doors. They include battery companies, wind-power companies and solar-tech companies such as Solyndra, whose 2010 bankruptcy cost the taxpayers at least $535 million. At least 1,000 workers were laid off when the California-based company closed. Follow Neil on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "The Obama administration’s “academic detailing” program — through which representatives from the federal government help doctors select prescription drugs for their patients — is coming under harsh behind-the-scenes criticism from corporate executives including the CEO of Pfizer, who is trying to have the project disbanded. The academic detailing project, created by President Obama’s 2009 stimulus program, sends federal government consultants to doctors’ offices and pharmacies to provide “evidence-based research findings” that can be used to help doctors and pharmacists choose prescription drugs for their clients. Academic detailing consultants visit doctors at approximately 1,300 primary care clinician sites and 200 hospitals and health systems in targeted areas around the country. “Trained clinician consultants visit physicians, pharmacists, nurses, other clinicians, and health care system decisionmakers nationwide to share unbiased, noncommercial information about medications and other therapeutic options with the goal of improving patient care,” according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Department of Health and Human Services agency responsible for overseeing the program. Critics view the academic detailing project as a conflict-of-interest because it allows the federal government — which has an incentive under Obamacare to keep health care costs low — to guide doctors toward choosing cheaper generic drugs for their patients. Pfizer CEO Ian Read strongly agreed with remarks calling the program a conflict of interest during the question-and-answer session at the annual Pfizer shareholder meeting in Short Hills, New Jersey Thursday. Pfizer, which supported Obamacare in 2010, is now working behind-the-scenes to pressure Washington lawmakers to repeal the “academic detailing” program. “We think it is a waste of public money, and certainly we disagree with the fact that the government-funded academic detailers are not bound by the same rules of detailing and the same rules of truthfulness that we are,” Read said. “We continue to educate Congress on this issue, and work with allies to try and get a reform on this issue,” Read said. “AHRQ has been very transparent in regard to our work in academic detailing,” an AHRQ spokesperson told The Daily Caller. But the agency did not release a full list of the doctors’ offices and pharmacies that its consultants have visited. In 2010, the AHRQ awarded two contracts worth $26.5 million to the Washington, D.C. office of Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide to “promote the adoption of findings and reports related to Patient-Centered Outcomes Research, also known as comparative effectiveness research,” according to an Ogilvy press release. “Comparative effectiveness research” is the AHRQ model that governs academic detailing research. Obama’s 2009 stimulus act allocated $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research. Academic detailing is very similar to the process by which representatives from pharmaceutical companies visit doctor’s offices to pitch their new drug products. But academic detailing consultants operate with little to no regulatory oversight, according to critics of the project. “When those drug company reps go in to speak to doctors, there has to be complete disclosure. There are strict regulations on that. And of course there should be. Drug companies are selling their products,” Jeff Stier, senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research, told TheDC. “But when the government goes in and does detailing, we don’t know what they’re saying. The spoken words in those meetings with doctors are not publicly available,” Stier said. “The government has an incentive to encourage physicians to prescribe cheaper generic drugs to save money. So when these academic detailers go into doctors’ offices, they have the same inherent conflict of interest,” Stier said.

        "articles": "The U.S. flag above the White House is back to full-staff less than two days after the death of Sen. John McCain. The flag’s position was quickly noticed by journalists and White House watchers early Monday morning and interpreted as a snub of McCain by President Donald Trump. Other flags at federal sites across Washington remained at half-staff in a period of mourning, further confusing the issue. Fairly striking image — all of the flags surrounding the Washington Monument are at half-staff, though the flag atop the White House was raised to full staff just after midnight. pic.twitter.com/BwKRbqKk0G — Alex Mallin (@alex_mallin) August 27, 2018 The practices and protocols governing the U.S. flag code are complicated. Official U.S. code dictates that after the death of a member of Congress, the flag must be flown at half-staff on the day of death and the day after. This procedure was followed by the White House staff, who lowered their flag on Saturday after the news of McCain’s death and kept it lowered all day Sunday. The discrepancy between the White House flag and the flag atop the Capitol is likely explained by a 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service, which states that, in practice, the flag atop the legislative chamber is kept lowered to half-staff until the day the deceased member is buried. While technically in line with protocol, the White House’s quick return to full-staff is unusual. Trump normally orders flags to remain at half-staff for an extended period after the loss of national figures, like he did after the death of former First Lady Barbara Bush.

        "articles": "White House officials remained silent during the extended Thanksgiving weekend, as Egypt’s pro-democracy groups called on President Barack Obama to condemn Thursday’s power grab by their country’s Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi. Morsi decreed Nov. 22 that his pronouncements and edicts were beyond the reach of judicial review. The announcement was met by resistance from the nation’s top judges, who said they would fight Morsi’s unusual self-elevation to near-dictator status. “I am waiting to see, I hope soon, a very strong statement of condemnation by the U.S., by Europe and by everybody who really cares about human dignity,” declared Mohamed ElBaradei, who is one of Egypt’s more visible non-Islamist politicians. So far, the White House has not weighed in, although Morsi’s power grab is a repudiation of the “Arab Spring” democracy movement that Obama has supported for two years. It is also a rejection of Obama’s efforts to use Egypt to mute the religious conflict between the Arab world and Israel, and a jarring followup to the Nov. 21 cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, which Morsi and Obama negotiated. Obama’s press secretary, Jay Carney, is expected to face media questions Nov. 26 about the administration’s response. So far, the White House’s only comment has been a nondescript paragraph, released Nov. 23 by the Department of State. “The decisions and declarations announced on November 22 raise concerns… We call for calm and encourage all parties to work together and call for all Egyptians to resolve their differences over these important issues peacefully and through democratic dialogue,” said the statement, which did not mention Morsi. There has been no White House response to ElBaradei’s Nov. 24 comments. Obama backed the 2011 removal of Egypt’s strongman, Hosni Mubarak, and then pressured Egypt’s army to stay on the sidelines while Islamist parties competed for — and won — roughly 75 percent of the seats in the nation’s parliament. But Morsi’s takeover now threatens to shift Egypt’s populist, Islam-friendly and democratic “Arab Spring” movement towards a hard-line Islamist theocracy, similar to Iran’s, which is hostile to democracy. Islamist theocracies create an apartheid-like system where Western-style rights are supplanted by Islamic sharia law, and where Muslim men rule over Muslim women, Christians and Jews. “Morsi appears to be fulfilling the [Islamists’] and his own long shared desire to re-create a Sharia supremacist Egyptian state,” Islam expert Andrew Bostom told The Daily Caller. Bostom is author of a new book, “Sharia versus Freedom: The Legacy of Islamic Totalitarianism.” Morsi asserted his dictatorial powers Nov. 22, amid applause from his fellow Islamists in the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party and those in the even more radical Salafists’ Nour party. In addition to making Morsi immune to judges’ oversight, the surprise declaration said that Egypt’s courts also have no authority over a constitution-writing panel that is now dominated by Islamists. The Islamists on the 100-member panel are pushing to impose Shariah Islamic law on the country’s roughly 72 million inhabitants, prompting a walkout this month by roughly 22 free-market and left-wing panel members. Morsi also announced a plan to retry recently released officials from the Mubarak regime, and described his political opponents in the same language — “thugs” — as protesters used to describe Mubarak’s supporters. Non-Islamist political parties, such as ElBaradei’s, are weak and divided, with the judiciary serving as the main obstacle to Egyptian Islamists’ advances. For example, judges dissolved the Islamist-dominated parliament in June. Islamists see them as a threat to their leverage on the constitution-writing panel. The non-Islamist parties include both free-market and left-wing politicians. Since Morsi’s announcement, their disparate supporters have united, protested and rioted, and are trying to organize major demonstrations. So far, the police force has followed Morsi’s orders and contained the anti-Morsi street protests. And the Egyptian army — whose senior generals were recently replaced by Morsi appointees — has not publicly objected to Morsi’s self-promotion. Morsi’s power grab came one day after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton effusively praised him for helping force an end to Israel’s counterattack against rocket assaults launched from the Gaza enclave by Hamas, an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood. “This is a critical moment for the region,” Clinton said. Nov. 21. “Egypt’s new government is assuming the responsibility and leadership that has long made this country a cornerstone of regional stability and peace.” Clinton’s statement reflected the administration’s long-standing decision to support democracy in Egypt, even if it comes with Islamists gaining political dominance. The strategy, outlined by Obama in a 2009 speech in Cairo, is to use democratic politics to help stabilize the region, and to weaken jihadi movements by arguing that Arabs can achieve their goals via the ballot box, rather than with attacks on American targets. Clinton met with Morsi in July, and warned Egypt’s military against intervention. “The United States supports the full transition to civilian rule with all that entails,” she said. U.S. officials say they have backed the results of the Egyptian elections — not Morsi or the Muslim Brotherhood. But Obama has repeatedly praised Morsi, and his deputies once announced plans for Morsi to visit White House. That plan was torpedoed when Libyan jihadis destroyed the U.S Consulate and CIA annex in the Libyan city of Benghazi and killed four Americans on Sept. 11. However, it is not clear if Morsi and his Islamist allies can, or wish to, distance themselves from jihadi groups like Hamas. Most Islamists and jihadis share a similar ideology and wish to create Islamic theocracies through elections, by force, or both. For example, in a May 2012 campaign speech Morsi promised an Islamic theocracy and a constitution built on Shariah Islamic law. “The Shariah, then the Shariah, and finally, the Shariah,” he declared. “This nation will enjoy blessing and revival only through the Islamic Shariah. I take an oath before Allah and before you all that regardless of the actual text [of the constitution] … this people will not accept a text that does not reflect the true meaning of the Islamic Shariah as a text to be implemented and as a platform.” Follow Neil on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Former CBS News Foreign Correspondent Lara Logan criticized the mainstream media for their left-leaning tilt during an interview with retired Navy SEAL Mike Ritland for the Friday episode of his “Mic Drop” podcast. WATCH (START AT 2:16:00): “You say the media is mostly liberal. I agree with you. It’s true. Why can I say that with certainty?” Logan began. “Well, first of all, I’ve been part of this for all my life. I’m 47 now and I’ve been a journalist since I was 17 and the media everywhere is mostly liberal, not just in the U.S., but in this country. Eighty-five percent of journalists are registered Democrats, so that’s just a fact.” (RELATED: CBS Reporter Lara Logan In Self-Quarantine After ’60 Minutes’ Report From Liberian Ebola Treatment Center) “Visually, anyone who’s ever been to Israel and been to the Wailing Wall has seen that the women have this tiny little spot in front of the wall to pray, and the rest of the wall is for the men,” she continued. “To me, that’s a great representation of the American media, is that in this tiny little corner where the women pray you’ve got Breitbart and Fox News and a few others, and from there on, you have CBS, ABC, NBC, Huffington Post, Politico, whatever, right? All of them.” “Although the media has always been left-leaning, we’ve abandoned our pretense or at least the effort to be objective today. We’ve become political activists, and some could argue propagandists, and there’s some merit to that,” Logan added. “Standards are out the window, I mean you read one story after another or hear it and it’s all based on one anonymous administration official, former administration official. That’s not journalism, that’s horseshit.” President Donald Trump has also frequently ridiculed publications that have published stories based solely on anonymous sources. Trump tweeted, “When you see ‘anonymous source,’ stop reading the story, it is fiction” back in August.

        "articles": "The State Department has done almost nothing to enhance security at dangerous diplomatic outposts since last year’s deadly Benghazi attack, the department’s chief watchdog reported. In an audit released Wednesday, the State Department’s inspector general blasted the department for failing to formulate a strategy to protect high-risk installations abroad, even after Libyan ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were murdered during a terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2012. “The Department of State has neither a conceptual framework nor a process for risk management,” the report reads. “There is no one person or office specifically tasked to oversee the assessment of risks in critical, high-threat locales and weigh those risks against … policy priorities to determine if the strategic value of the program outweighs the associated risks.” The inspector general’s office accused the State Department of dragging its feet in implementing new security standards for the 27 overseas posts designated “high-threat” after the Benghazi attack. In doing so, it denounced the department for ignoring recommendations from the Benghazi Accountability Review Board (ARB). “The Department’s actions to date do not comply with this recommendation,” auditors wrote. “The Benghazi ARB specifically tasked the Department to identify minimum security standards for occupancy in high-risk, high-threat environments. … [The current standards] do not establish minimum security standards for occupancy or address requirements beyond construction standards.” Tom Fitton, president of the D.C.-based government accountability group Judicial Watch, was unsurprised by the audit’s findings. “The tepid IG report is further confirmation that American diplomatic personnel continue to be at risk over one year after Benghazi,” he said in a statement to The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Why didn’t [former Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton implement immediately all of these security recommendations?” Fitton blamed the department’s inability to enact adequate security precautions on “the dangerous ‘we know better’ arrogance of the Obama State Department leadership.” The inspector general also investigated the Benghazi Accountability Review Board itself, whose members were hand-picked by Clinton in the months after the Benghazi attack. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and other Republican lawmakers had previously questioned the Benghazi ARB’s political independence, charging that it had failed to hold high-level State Department officials accountable for their failures. But the inspector general’s office ultimately gave the board a pass. “The Accountability Review Board process operates as intended — independently and without bias — to identify vulnerabilities in the Department of State’s security programs,” the investigators alleged. “The idea that the ARB wasn’t biased is laughable,” said Fitton. “There is inherent bias in who investigators choose to question — and, incredibly, the ARB didn’t question Hillary Clinton (the very person who appointed the ARB board members).” “This IG report seems like another whitewash with weak recommendations for more bureaucracy,” he concluded.

        "articles": "(Photo by Matthew Lewis/Getty Images) Senators proposed a bill this summer to prevent federal taxpayer funding from going towards the construction of professional sports arenas, and after more players began supporting the protest of the national anthem before games, the legislation may begin to pick up steam. A companion measure to the legislation was already proposed in the House back in March by Oklahoma Republican Rep. Steve Russell. Last June, New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and Republican Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford put forth a bill that would ban professional sports teams from using municipal bonds in relation to federal funding to build their sports arenas. “Professional sports teams generate billions of dollars in revenue,” Booker said in a statement. “There’s no reason why we should give these multimillion-dollar businesses a federal tax break to build new stadiums. It’s not fair to finance these expensive projects on the backs of taxpayers, especially when wealthy teams end up reaping most of the benefits.” The Oklahoma Republican senator agreed, saying, “The federal government is responsible for a lot of important functions, but financing sports stadiums for multi-million – sometimes billion – dollar franchises is definitely not one of them.” A spokesman from Lankford’s office told The Daily Caller Sunday that in the last four weeks interest in the bill has picked up since both members proposed it four months ago. Should taxpayers have to pick up the tab for stadiums for wealthy professional athletes and team owners who thumb their noses when the national anthem is played in those very stadiums? Players on the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars, all who can potentially benefit from taxpayer dollars at the local, state and federal levels, followed the lead of former San Francisco 49er quarterback Colin Kaepernick Sunday. They kneeled during the national anthem at a game against each other in London. Other teams stayed in their locker rooms for the anthem. The incident happened one day after President Donald Trump criticized professional football players who kneel during the anthem, which set off a war of words on Twitter between the president and professional sports figures. Kaepernick claimed his protest of the national anthem last season stemmed from treatment of blacks by law enforcement, but by the end of the season Kaepernick’s demonstrations, joined at that point by other players, led the reason to the league’s TV ratings plunge, ESPN reported. Not only have viewers bid farewell to the NFL but attendees at teams’ taxpayer-funded stadiums appear to be refusing to fill seats. Last Thursday, the San Francisco 49ers and the L.A. Rams played before a poorly attended crowd. According to Booker and Lankford, for the past 17 years, 36 professional athletic stadiums have been built or renovated by federal tax-exempted municipal bonds. This cost taxpayers $3.2 billion dollars, the Brookings Institute reported last year. Despite claims from local officials and team owners that the construction of these stadiums would create jobs and economic growth, research from the Journal of Economic Perspectives showed “there is no statistically significant positive correlation between sports facility construction and economic development,” specifically aimed at income growth or job creation.

        "articles": "On Sunday’s broadcast of ABC’s “This Week,” Mary Matalin, a former adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, argued Republican Missouri senatorial candidate Todd Akin’s week-old comments about legitimate rape have been overplayed by Democrats hoping to prove the existence of a “war on women.” But according to Fox News Channel’s Greta Van Susteren, who also appeared as a panelist, Akin had handed a big boost to Democratic opponent Sen. Claire McCaskill. “Sen. McCaskill should be sending a fruit basket to Congressman Akin every single day,” Van Susteren said. “And what has happened, the Republican Party has a horrible gender gap. And all of those women were sort of on the edge, now the Democratic Party has incredible ammunition against Republicans for the undecided women, who think ‘legitimate rape,’ what’s that? I mean, that’s the danger — the gender gap. You shake your head ‘no’ at me.” Matalin pointed out that Democrats also have a gender problem of their own. “I’m shaking my head because the Democratic gender gap with men as great as the gender gap with women,” Matalin said. “Greta — after the sustained war on women, that Romney is everything, from a dog abuser, to a wife cancer giver, to a felon, to a tax cheat, multimillion dollars, multi-state, multi-faceted the gender gap has remained stable, as has Obama’s with men. We’re doing fine with women. What’s driving the gender gap with Obama — excuse me, one second — is liberal women, women under 30 and post-graduate women. Romney wins every other woman, middle class moms, suburbans. Those are the women who are going to vote. The enthusiasm among younger people, in particularly post-graduate, that’s not enough to overcome the women that Romney is going to win.” “And this war on women is ridiculous,” she continued. “Do you don’t think that Republicans who are married and have daughters and have sisters don’t care about women’s health or are going to ban contraception?” Follow Jeff on Twitter The Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006",

        "articles": "Getty Images Since October 1, 2016 — the first day of Fiscal Year 2017 — 2,959 Somali refugees have been admitted into the United States. (State Department, Refugee Processing Center) According to Breitbart, Somali refugees first started seeking asylum in the United States in 1986, yet the rate at which they are entering the country — across the first two months of the fiscal year — has never been higher. The FY2017 figures — taken from the State Department’s continually updating online database — mark a more than 30 percent jump from the previous, highest rate, recorded in FY2005 when 2,171 refugees entered the country across the same timeframe. (State Department, Refugee Processing Center) If the refugee influx continues at the current rate — more than 42 per day — the United States can expect to welcome 15,652 Somali refugees to its shores for the entire year. Furthermore, 764 Somali refugees have entered the United States since November 28, 2016. In other words, roughly 25 percent of all Somali refugees entering the country in FY2017 did so in the 10 days after a Somali refugee went on an Islam-inspired stabbing spree at Ohio State University. (RELATED: Everything We Know About Abdul Razak Ali Artan) (State Department, Refugee Processing Center) An overwhelming majority of the refugees said they were of the Muslim faith, with 2,840 self-identifying themselves as non-denominational followers and 117 as Sunni Muslims. (State Department, Refugee Processing Center) So far in FY2017, Somali refugees have been settled in 39 states and Washington, DC, with Arizona (161), Kentucky (198), New York (313), Ohio (192), Texas (145) and Georgia (107) being the heaviest hit. United States intelligence agencies have maintained that terrorist groups will try to smuggle operatives into refugees seeking asylum in the West. (RELATED: CIA Director Warns ISIS Plans To Exploit Immigration System) CIA Director James Brenna testified before Congress in June that the United States had not diminished ISIS’ “global reach,” and that the terrorist group “has a large cadre of Western fighters who could potentially serve as operatives for attacks” abroad.

        "articles": "REUTERS/ICE/Handout via Reuters) A reversal of the flood of illegal immigrants and drugs across the southern US border seems beyond reach. A missing piece of the puzzle, however, has flown under the radar. The Obama administration exacerbated these problems by favoring collectivists in Latin America, most notably dictator Raúl Castro of Cuba. Under the cover of foreign aid and the UN-created CICIG commission, Obama’s presence came to bear in Guatemala. As the geopolitical center of illegal immigration and drugs for the United States, a lawless Guatemala guarantees a steady flow. Mexico shares a 595-mile border and has proved incapable of resistance. As US Customs and Border Protection has documented, Central Americans outnumber Mexicans crossing the border illegally. During the Obama tenure, the number of unaccompanied children arriving from the Northern Triangle — Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras — ballooned from 3,304 in 2009 to 46,893 in 2016. The UN high commissioner for refugees says the five-fold increase in Northern Triangle asylum seekers since 2008 is “a staggering indicator of the surging violence shaking the region.” The problem, according to Admiral Kurt Tidd of the US Southern Command, “is a very big one indeed.” He identifies the destabilizing and corruptive influence of “transnational threat networks,” including from the Middle East, which work with local gangs to reach the United States. The same pattern holds for narcotics, with up to 94 percent of smuggled heroin coming via Mexico. It isn’t Mexican heroin, though, since their military has almost completely wiped out the crop. Instead, narcos use rural Guatemala to grow poppies and transport heroin, particularly from Colombia. These rural areas are lawless and dominated by gangs descended from the Castro-trained Marxist guerrillas of Guatemala’s armed conflict (1960-1996) — thanks to protection from their allies that Obama imposed on the government. Obama’s radical brethren control Guatemala’s judiciary and criminal prosecution via the CICIG. These gangs force inhabitants into their criminal agenda. Under duress, the indigenous victims block police from enforcing the law and destroy businesses that would create wealth and opportunity. The interior minister, in his position thanks to Obama’s ambassador, directs police to engage in “dialogue” with guerrilla successors, as they commit flagrant crimes. In their rare occurrence, police fail to execute arrest warrants on well-connected targets. If cases do get to court, judges face intimidation to release defendants regardless of evidence and law. Infiltrated higher courts also overturn any decision against the gangs that dominate the rural areas. The US ambassador has been an accomplice, and he has sought to silence those who speak out. He calls opponents corrupt and threatens criminal prosecution, and he has cancelled their US visas. The ambassador’s threats extend to Guatemala’s highest court. A member of the Congress, for example, reports that magistrates fear investigations and visa problems if they rule against the ambassador’s wishes. This leads to illegal rulings against businesses and political enemies in favor of radicals. Unfortunately, the State Department has echoed the propaganda of the guerrilla successors in Guatemala. In their 2016 human-rights report, for example, they covered for those obstructing regional development projects. This follows the ideological pattern that just led the State Department to blame Israel for inciting Palestinian terrorism. Likewise, as anti-freedom UN officials go after Israel, the CICIG goes after Guatemala. With no oversight, the CICIG refuses to prosecute the collectivist gangs. Yet it has allies in the US Congress and runs on US taxpayer dollars. At the July 19 hearings to confirm the new ambassador to Guatemala, Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) said the CICIG “has not only been successful in addressing impunity in Guatemala but also serves as a model for other countries in the region.” He joins George Soros’s Open Society, which claims that the “CICIG now stands as a potent potential model.” Yes, a model to impose radical collectivists on friendly countries trying to be free. After suffering under the Obama-protected guerrilla successors, Guatemala’s rural population is hungry for liberation and economic opportunity. Economic elites, victims of Obama’s allies’ arbitrary application of law, would also readily support the rule of law. A tactic to cover for Obama’s lawlessness in Guatemala has been to tout counter-narcotics cooperation and inflated statistics that imply progress in the fight against organized crime. Meanwhile, the guerrilla successors increase the flow of illegal immigrants and narcotics. Last week Attorney General Jeff Sessions was in El Salvador seeking to combat the harm done by the MS-13 gang. However, the Trump administration’s efforts will fail unless they address the Guatemalan gateway. Applying the law in rural Guatemala would significantly reduce the flow of illegals and narcotics prior to reaching Mexico, where corrupt officials provide easy passage. The Trump administration must, therefore, reverse the Obama policy and genuinely help bring the rule of law, which won’t happen through the UN-created commission.

        "articles": "TAMPA, Fla. — Academy award-winning actor and conservative activist Jon Voight told The Daily Caller that he is “feeding” his daughter, actress Angelina Jolie, political “information” with the hope of influencing her view of President Barack Obama. Jolie told TheDC in January that she is disappointed in a “few things” Obama has done but would not elaborate. TheDC asked Voight if Jolie is still supportive of Obama as the election draws near. “I don’t know, but I know that I give her the information that I’m dealing with and I like both these guys very much, you know. I love my daughter and she’s very smart and I just keep feeding her information,” he told TheDC at the Republican National Convention. Actor Brad Pitt, Jolie’s fiancé, previously told TheDC that he supports Obama. “Now Brad has a very close connection with his buddy George, George Clooney, and he’s not going to go too far from the fold there, I guess, but anyway we’ll see. The idea is, I tell you what, they’ve got to open their eyes because they don’t know anything, that’s the trouble with most of the people on the left,” Voight told TheDC. “They don’t know anything because the media that they’re being fed and the friends that are feeding them stuff, they are not getting information. They don’t know anything about Barack Obama, except what he says he is and they buy it.” When asked if he thinks Jolie will vote for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in November, he responded, “Oh, you never know.

The document, revealed online Monday by the National Review, describes the candidate’s liabilities likely to be exploited by opponents. It also specifically describes the necessity of raising money from Jews, Asians and gays while working to increase turnout of African-Americans and Latinos. Speaking of the Jewish community, the document notes: “There is tremendous financial opportunity.” “Michelle’s position on Israel will largely determine the level of support here,” the document states, with a goal of raising $250,000. The campaign document also calls for staffers to produce “pushback documents” on “each identified vulnerability in Michelle’s record, as well as common attacks frequently leveled against Democratic Senate candidates.” Topics the campaign expects could be used against her: the activities of Points of Light, the non-profit she leads, and the salary she earns; the notion that she is “too liberal,” a “rubber stamp for Democrats,” “Obama’s/Harry Reid/Nancy Pelosi Best Friend,” “not a ‘real’ Georgian,” and is “a lightweight.” Problematic issues the campaign should be ready for, the document notes, include Obamacare, gay marriage and guns.

        "articles": "Jacob Bojesson/The Daily Caller News Foundation BUDAPEST, Hungary — When other countries welcomed refugees with open arms, Hungary decided it was time to eradicate illegal immigration at any cost. The country succeeded, but that success damaged relations with the European Union in the process. Hungary’s second border fence has just been completed in the southern town of Asotthalom. The 96-mile long, 14 ft. tall double-line of defense doesn’t look too intimidating from a distance. Go a little closer and you’ll notice several layers of razor-wire capable of delivering electric shocks, cameras, heat sensors and loudspeakers ready to tell migrants they’re about to break Hungarian law if they as much as touch the fence. Add a few hundred military officers and “border hunters” and it’s virtually impossible to break. Close to every police officer in the country is part of a rotation to make sure the grounds are covered at all times. Temporary military bases have been set up by the border to house them while they do their rotation. More than 1,000 volunteers will receive generous salary and benefit packages when they deploy as “border hunters” after extensive training. The area surrounding the fence is closed off for the public. Visitors need to apply for access in advance and photos of guards and the Serbian side are strictly prohibited for security purposes. If a migrant is lucky enough to make it across, local guards patrol the surrounding area around the clock. The ones who are caught are arrested and dropped off on the Serbian side. They don’t even get a chance to apply for asylum unless they do so at a “transit zone” where they are held in housing containers while their cases get processed. Prime Minister Viktor Orban wants to make it impossible for uninvited guests to make it across the border, no matter the numbers they arrive in, and it appears as though he has succeeded. “They don’t even try,” a local border guard tells The Daily Caller News Foundation. “We haven’t had a Syrian in six months.” Rewind back to September 2015 and there’s a completely different picture. Thousands of migrants streamed across the border every day as they made their way north to Austria, Germany and Scandinavia. “It was an invasion,” Laszlo Toroczkai, the mayor of Asotthalom, told TheDCNF. “Illegal immigration is a crime in a normal country. It’s not a normal thing to break into a country.” Toroczkai decided to start a war on illegal immigration. He wanted a fence, and the government agreed. “The real public mood was: hang on this is not good, you should do something,” Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesman for the Hungarian government, told TheDCNF. “You should at least have the ability to handle what’s going on.” While Hungary is far from the final destination for most migrants, its location along the so-called “Balkan route” made it a natural pit stop for hundreds of thousands of people pursuing a life in western Europe. “By the mid-year it was well beyond 100,000 people who care across us,” Kovacs said. “In the beginning of September there were days when 10,000 came.” The Orban administration looked at a number of measures before deciding on the fence. The results were staggering. The influx went down from 6,353 one day to 870 the next. Illegal border crossings were steadily below 40 per day throughout the rest of the month.

Like it or not, and that’s the point we always make, there is no more effective way [to stop] illegal border crossings than building a physical barrier,” Kovacs told TheDCNF. “You might not like it, it’s not a nice thing, but … the only way to stop illegal border crossings is [to] first build a fence, man it, equip it, and also, in parallel, build up your capabilities in terms of legal confines, legal circumstances to be able to handle what is coming.” Kovacs describes the fence as “an act of solidarity” toward the rest of the EU. By stopping migrants from entering the country, Hungary argues it keeps immigrants out of the entire 28-nation bloc. The government expected other countries to offer assistance, but the help never came. “Instead we’ve received only political barrage and charges that we are inhumane and stuff like that,” Kovacs said. The measures have cost around 700 million euros ($763 million), according to Kovacs’ rough estimates. He believes the bill would have been “a lot more” if the country didn’t take action, as the costs of hosting and deporting migrants quickly add up. The real price it had to pay was, instead, of a diplomatic nature. Just before the fence went up in 2015, EU voted in favor of imposing migrant quotas for each member. The idea was to ease the pressure on the frontline states — particularly Greece and Italy. Hungary was slated to host 1,294 migrants as part of deal, but the government refused. It instead joined Slovakia to take legal action against the EU. “We would like to retain the elements of sovereignty, which are there by law, and we are against a stealth way of taking away elements of your sovereignty,” Kovacs said. Hungary argues the “four freedoms” of the EU project — the free movement of goods, capital, services and people — can only be ensured if the outer borders are protected. “You can not defend the achievements of Schengen from within. It has be done at the borders,” Kovacs said. While the international reaction to Orban’s immigration policies has been anything but good, the people of Hungary have shown great support. Orban announced a referendum on the quotas in February 2016, saying he would openly campaign for a “no” vote. The referendum had no legal implications for the EU, but a successful result for the Orban administration would still send a strong message to liberal allies. Hungarians almost unanimously backed Orban, with 98.4 percent voting no. The voter turnout of just above 44 percent made the results invalid, but the crushing support for Orban’s agenda solidified Hungary’s image as a rebel within the EU. “It’s common sense,” Kovacs said of the results. “Many say that what we have [in Hungary] is something like xenophobia, but it’s certainly not true.” While the government was unable to use the results for legislative action, it continued to impose immigration measures. The Hungarian parliament passed legislation in March to put all asylum seekers in container housing along the border, to await legal processing. The move caused outcry among international aid organizations, with Amnesty International calling it a “flagrant violation of international law.” “Rounding up all men, women and children seeking asylum and detaining them months on end in container camps is a new low in Hungary’s race to the bottom on asylum seekers and refugees,” Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty’s deputy director for Europe, said in a statement. The government, on the other hand, calls the detention label “misleading” since the asylum seekers have the option to leave and return to their home countries at any point. “It’s misleading, it’s not detention, most definitely not in respect to the penalty element of it,” Kovacs said. [dcquiz] A number of countries are allegedly prepared to issue an ultimatum for Hungary and Poland this fall to either accept more refugees or leave the union. The feud with the EU has escalated in other areas as well. EU has threatened to file a lawsuit against the country after it moved to regulate foreign-funded universities — particularly one established by Hungarian billionaire George Soros. Despite the tense situation, the Orban administration remains positive toward the European project’s original purpose. “We believe that the destination that the founding fathers have given to the European Union at that time was good,” Kovacs said. “Now, when you bump into problems and a crisis, you should go back to the founding fathers. That’s what the U.S. usually does and it works.” Follow Jacob on Twitter Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "articles": "Robert Mueller Getty Images/Alex Wong WASHINGTON, D.C. — Lawyers for Russian company Concord Management and Consulting, LLC, formally entered a “not guilty” plea in federal court Monday in a case special counsel Robert Mueller probably never thought would happen. Mueller, weathering significant criticism that his Russian collusion case was thin, unveiled a grandiose indictment Feb. 16 against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies. The 13 Russians in question were charged with waging “information warfare” in the United States, interfering with the 2016 presidential election, and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Mueller generated headlines with the February indictment, safe in the knowledge the 13 Russians were beyond U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, there would be no trial — only sensational Russian collusion accusations. Mueller may now have to try the case, and Concord’s lawyers have put the special counsel on notice. The Russian company’s lawyers intend to invoke “discovery” to obtain U.S. intelligence about what they knew of Russian activities. “I guess Mueller thought it was a freebie, for sure,” former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy told The Daily Caller News Foundation after the court proceeding. “He thought it could make this association (of Russian collusion) and it would never be challenged in court,” McCarthy, also a National Review contributing editor, said. Concord retained the services of two attorneys at mega law firm Reed Smith, and the company is demanding a speedy trial. The lawyers indicated they were going to exercise Concord’s rights under discovery to examine all of Mueller’s “evidence” of the conspiracy. In starting Wednesday’s trial, Eric A. Dubelier, a Reed Smith law partner, entered a “not guilty” plea in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He also repeated his client’s interest for a “speedy trial.” McCarthy called Mueller’s entire indictment an “unforced error.” “One thing you never want to do is to indict in a case that you’re not prepared to try,” McCarthy said. Mueller tried to delay Wednesday’s hearing and floated a claim Concord had not been properly served notice. “Until the Court has an opportunity to determine if Concord was properly served, it would be inadvisable to conduct an initial appearance and arraignment at which important rights will be communicated and a plea entertained,” Mueller’s lawyers filed in federal court. But Concord opposed the motion. “The Special Counsel is not entitled to special rules and is required like the Attorney General to follow the rules of the Court,” Dubelier stated in his response to Mueller. U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich agreed with Concord and rejected Mueller’s request for a delay in the trial without comment, which led to Wednesday’s arraignment. Concord wants a “speedy trial” as provided by federal law, the company’s lawyers also repeated Wednesday. The case will resume July 9. It is the second legal headache for Mueller in two weeks. Last week, federal Judge T.S. Ellis, III, a Reagan appointee, threatened to throw out the special counsel’s indictment of Paul Manafort since the charges against President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager did not relate to any charges of Russian collusion. Instead, the charges were tied to banking activities that went as far back as 2005 — more than a decade before Trump announced his intention to run for president.

        "articles": "Scott Olson/Getty Images A federal judge dismissed Ferguson, Mo., rioters’ $40 million civil rights that claimed police used excessive force against them Monday. U.S. District Judge Henry Autrey ruled in favor of the Missouri law enforcement, reports WWMT. The nine plaintiffs, “have completely failed to present any credible evidence that any of the actions taken by these individuals were taken with malice or were committed in bad faith,” Autrey wrote in his ruling. Protesters gathered after the police shooting of Michael Brown to demonstrate. Prosecutors and the Department of Justice investigation found that Brown tried to grab police officer Darren Wilson’s gun. Wilson shot Brown after he tried to charge him. (RELATED: Michael Brown’s Family To File Wrongful Death Lawsuit Against Ferguson) The protests grew violent, with people looting stores and setting businesses on fire. The plaintiffs claimed in the lawsuit that Ferguson police beat them, used tear gas, shot them with rubber bullets and arrested them illegally. Autrey dismissed those allegations, saying protesters had been given ample warnings to leave, but chose to ignore them. Autrey also gave the officers involved in the lawsuit immunity from it. A lawyer for the protesters, Gregory Lattimer, expressed disappointment with the judge’s ruling. “The decision was unfair and not consistent with applicable law,” Lattimer told NBC News. The protesters have already filed a notice that they intend to appeal the ruling in the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. “This is a battle we will keep fighting. We will end it in the right way and get justice for these people,” Lattimer said. Follow Amber on Twitter Send tips to amber@newsfoundation.org.

        "articles": "rainbow unicorn YouTube screenshot/Kipper A group of illegal immigrants at Columbia University is demanding that school officials give them free health care. The illegal immigrants also want the Ivy League school to institute compulsory “sensitivity training” for professors and administrators. The illegal immigrant group, called Undocumented Students Initiative (UndoCU for short), presented its list of 13 demands on Facebook last week. Among its 13 demands, the group calls for “full reimbursement” of health insurance fees for students who are illegal immigrants. Currently, Columbia only reimburses illegal immigrant students for “portions of these fees,” the document says. As Campus Reform notes, Columbia — like virtually every other college in the United States — requires enrolled students to maintain health insurance. Columbia students who are not sufficiently insured by their families must pay up to $3,000 each year in health insurance fees. A single year of tuition, fees and room and board at Columbia costs $68,300. However, students whose families have total incomes of less than $60,000 typically attend the Ivy League bastion for free — with zero loans for parents or students. The illegal immigrants at Columbia say they are unsatisfied with the school’s generous financial aid. “Some of us were on the verge of homelessness. Some, including their families, are at high risk of deportation,” the UndoCU Facebook post claims. “That the university is not active in aiding and ameliorating these problems demonstrates Columbia’s lack of intrinsic interest in its undocumented students.” As such, the Columbia University UndoCU illegal immigrants group demands “specialized fundraising for undocumented students” to underwrite “undocumented student specific scholarships and grants.” The illegal immigrant group also demands mandatory “sensitivity training” for professors, teaching assistants “and all other staff in terms of immigration language and rhetoric.” The group compares discussions of illegal immigration to discussions about sex. “Much like sexual health training, it is imperative that immigration subjects be treated with the proper language and information. It is unacceptable for students to be called ‘illegal’ in their own classrooms or for professors to tell us to ‘get legal,'” UndoCU declares. Additional ultimatums include a demand for “specifically trained immigration counselors as well as counselors trained in trauma” and a demand for “career counselors who understand” the “unique situation” of illegal immigrants “and the sensitive attention it demands.” [dcquiz] The UndoCU group also wants illegal immigrant students to be reimbursed for a $70 fee charged to international students. And they want an immediate end to the “shifty, disorganized, and un-proactive” summer housing process which some illegal immigrants claim to have faced when dealing with the Columbia administration. “We are willing to work with anyone, to any extent, in order to resolve these issues,” the illegal immigrant group says. “We refuse, however, to amend or change any of these demands.” The entire UndoCU Facebook post clocks in at 790 words — just over half the length of the Declaration of Independence. Here it is in its entirety: The Undocumented Students Initiative organized just before the election of Donald Trump, Campus Reform notes. Columbia University is most famous, of course, because a student named Emma Sulkowicz hauled a mattress around campus for a year to protest the school’s handling of her alleged rape. Sulkowicz apparently released a full-on sex tape recreating her alleged rape. “Please, don’t participate in my rape,” a trigger warning for viewers of the video explained. “Watch kindly.” (RELATED: Columbia’s Mattress Girl Has Made An ‘Artistic’ Sex Tape) The fancypants school also offers segregated graduation ceremonies based on skin color and sexual preference.

        "articles": "While the Supreme Court weighs the constitutionality of Obamacare and the nation reels from the Obama administration’s order that Catholic hospitals must provide contraceptives and abortifacients to their employees, the ACLU of Arizona is attacking a proposal to restore employers’ freedom of conscience. House Bill 2625, sponsored by Republican State Senator Debbie Lesko, would allow all Arizona employers to opt out of the federal contraception mandate. To the ACLU, this is tantamount to shutting off medical care to women. The ACLU has launched an online petition with the promise that “we won’t stand silently by and watch extremists use religion to discriminate.” An ACLU press release claims that the bill “would take away women’s access to basic health services.” While the statement stops just short of declaring a tongue-depressor crisis and neglects to include a video of a Paul Ryan lookalike pushing an old woman in a wheelchair off a cliff, some in the media have picked up on the ACLU’s line and upped the ante. For instance, New York Daily News writer Lindsay Goldwert actually led off an article on the Arizona legislation this way: Do you take birth control in the state of Arizona? Under a new bill making its way through the state legislature, that could become a fireable offense. Say what? All the bill does is allow employers to choose health plans that reflect their values. It says nothing about the private lives of employees. At one time, The Daily News actually employed editors, but that was before the Internet. Ms. Goldwert goes on to quote ACLU of Arizona Public Policy Director Anjali Abraham, who coyly opines, “Whether an employer can actually fire a woman who is found to be taking birth control is unclear, but it leaves room for that possibility.” I guess it also leaves room for the possibility of a company forcing female employees to watch bass fishing on TV, since it does not specifically prohibit that. In a column for The Arizona Republic, Catherine Glenn Foster, an Alliance Defense Fund litigation counsel, explains that the proposal amends earlier laws that overreach in similar fashion to the Obamacare dictate: The 2002 government mandates attack the religious freedom of all Arizona citizens by forcing all employers to cover abortion-inducing drugs and other objectionable items related to contraception — even if they must violate their religious beliefs. HB 2625 fixes that by declaring that any entity or individual with a religious objection to paying for such coverage is free to contract with an employer and insurer who want to honor their conscience. In fact, other religious freedom statutes in Arizona already make the anti-religious mandates unlawful, and HB 2625 simply fixes those statutes to make them comport with existing law. One more thing: If an insured employee uses contraceptives for actual medical purposes, such as to treat endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), her employer must reimburse the cost. From this, the ACLU and other panic merchants derive the idea that a woman will be fired just for using birth control. No, she’d have to lie about using it for other purposes so her employer’s insurance would pay for it. Or she could just get it down at Target or Wal-Mart for $9.00 a month.

        "articles": "(Shutterstock/Martin Capek) A new study found adjustments made to global surface temperature readings by scientists in recent years “are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data.” “Thus, it is impossible to conclude from the three published [global average surface temperature (GAST)] data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever – despite current claims of record setting warming,” according to a study published June 27 by two scientists and a veteran statistician. The peer-reviewed study tried to validate surface temperature datasets managed by NASA, NOAA and the UK’s Met Office, all of which make adjustments to raw thermometer readings. Skeptics of man-made global warming have criticized the adjustments. Climate scientists often apply adjustments to surface temperature thermometers to account for “biases” in the data. The new study doesn’t question the adjustments themselves but notes adjustments has increased the warming trend in published temperature records over the years. Basically, “cyclical pattern in the earlier reported data has very nearly been ‘adjusted’ out” of temperature readings taken from weather stations, buoys, ships and other sources. [dcquiz] More recent published versions surface temperature records cool past temperatures and warm more current temperatures, increasing the warming trend, according to the study’s authors. Over time newer versions of the temperature record show more warming than past ones. “Nearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments,” Meteorologist Joe D’Aleo, a study co-author, told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an interview. “Each dataset pushed down the 1940s warming and pushed up the current warming.” “You would think that when you make adjustments you’d sometimes get warming and sometimes get cooling. That’s almost never happened,” said D’Aleo, who co-authored the study with statistician James Wallace and Cato Institute climate scientist Craig Idso. Their study found measurements “nearly always exhibited a steeper warming linear trend over its entire history,” which was “nearly always accomplished by systematically removing the previously existing cyclical temperature pattern.” “The conclusive findings of this research are that the three [global average surface temperature] data sets are not a valid representation of reality,” the study found. “In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data.” Based on these results, the study’s authors claim the science underpinning the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) authority to regulate greenhouse gases “is invalidated.” The new study will be included in petitions by conservative groups to the EPA to reconsider the 2009 endangerment finding, which gave the agency its legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Sam Kazman, an attorney with the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), said the study added an “important new piece of evidence to this debate” over whether to reopen the endangerment finding. CEI petitioned EPA to reopen the endangerment finding in February. “I think this adds a very strong new element to it,” Kazman told TheDCNF. “It’s enough reason to open things formally and open public comment on the charges we make.” Since President Donald Trump ordered EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to review the Clean Power Plan, there’s been speculation the administration would reopen the endangerment finding to new scrutiny. The Obama-era document used three lines of evidence to claim such emissions from vehicles “endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.” D’Aleo and Wallace filed a petition with EPA on behalf of their group, the Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council (CHECC). They relied on past their past research, which found one of EPA’s lines of evidence “simply does not exist in the real world.” Their 2016 study “failed to find that the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations have had a statistically significant impact on any of the 13 critically important temperature time series data analyzed.” “In sum, all three of the lines of evidence relied upon by EPA to attribute warming to human GHG emissions are invalid,” reads CHCC’s petition. “The Endangerment Finding itself is therefore invalid and should be reconsidered. Pruitt’s largely been silent on whether or not he would reopen the endangerment finding, but the administrator did say he was spearheading a red team exercise to tackle climate science. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry also came out in favor of red-blue team exercises, which are used by the military and intelligence agencies to expose any vulnerabilities to systems or strategies. Environmental activists and climate scientists largely panned the idea, with some even arguing it would be “dangerous” to elevate minority scientific opinions. “Such calls for special teams of investigators are not about honest scientific debate,” wrote climate scientist Ben Santer and Kerry Emanuel and historian and activist Naomi Oreskes. “They are dangerous attempts to elevate the status of minority opinions, and to undercut the legitimacy, objectivity and transparency of existing climate science,” the three wrote in a recent Washington Post op-ed. “Frankly, I think you could do a red-blue team exercise as part of reviewing the endangerment finding,” Kazman said. Though Kazman did warn a red team exercise could be a double-edged sword if not done correctly. He worries some scientists not supportive of the idea could undermine the process from the inside and use it to grandstand. Update: This article has been corrected for clarity.
