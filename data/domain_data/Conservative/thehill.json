        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The media is asking the wrong question about the Michael Flynn case. They are asking whether Flynn lied or the FBI acted improperly, as if the answers to those two questions are mutually exclusive. The possibility that both are true, in that Flynn did not tell the truth and that the FBI acted improperly, is not considered in our hyper partisan world where everyone, including the media, chooses a side and refuses to consider the chance that their side is not perfectly right and the other side not perfectly evil. The first casualty of hyper partisanship is nuance. So when nuance is condemned as being insufficiently partisan, truth quickly becomes the next casualty. Flynn, during his brief time as national security adviser to President TrumpDonald TrumpHouse Democrats eye 26.5 percent corporate tax rate Iran accepts deal on nuclear monitoring, avoids censure Old South vs. the new America: What Confederate monuments say about us MORE, told FBI agents untruths that are contradicted by hard evidence. Why he did that remains a mystery because, with his vast experience in intelligence gathering, he must have known that the FBI had hard evidence of the conversations he denied having with a Russian diplomat. Be that as it may, this reality does not automatically exclude the possibility that the FBI acted improperly in eliciting untruths from him. The FBI knew the truth. They had recordings of the conversations. Then why did they ask him whether he had those conversations? Obviously, not to learn whether he had them but, rather, to give him the opportunity to lie to federal agents so that they could squeeze him to provide damaging information against President Trump. If you do not believe me, read what Judge T.S. Ellis III, who presided over the Paul ManafortPaul John ManafortDOJ investigating one-time Trump campaign adviser over alleged ties to Qatar: report Foreign lobbyists donated over M during 2020 election: report Former Mueller prosecutor representing Donoghue in congressional probes: report MORE trial, said to the prosecutors: “You do not really care about Mr. Manafort’s bank fraud. What you really care about is what information Mr. Manafort could give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump or lead to his prosecution or impeachment.” Ellis continued: “This vernacular to ‘sing’ is what prosecutors use. What you have got to be careful of is that they may not only sing, they may compose.” Experienced criminal lawyers have seen this phenomenon at work. Most judges, many of whom were former prosecutors, have also seen it. But few have the courage to expose it publicly as Ellis did. Judge Emmet Sullivan of the District of Columbia Court also has expressed concern regarding federal prosecutorial practices in the investigation. Defenders of the tactics used by special counsel Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerSenate Democrats urge Garland not to fight court order to release Trump obstruction memo Why a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel MORE argue that his potential witnesses are generally guilty of some crime, such as lying to FBI agents, and that may well be true. But they are targeted not because of what they may have done. They are targeted for what they may know about what the real target may have done. Then they, and their relatives who may also be complicit, are threatened with imprisonment and bankruptcy unless they plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors. So the real question, which transcends the Flynn, the Manafort, and even the Trump investigations, is whether these tactics should be deemed acceptable to use in our justice system. Is it the proper role of law enforcement to conduct criminal morality tests to determine whether citizens will tell the truth or lie when given the opportunity to do either by FBI agents? Is it proper to target individuals for such tests for the purpose of pressuring them into becoming witnesses against the real target? These are important questions for all citizens who care about civil liberties and prosecutorial abuses. They should not be addressed in a partisan manner. Instead, they should be answered by reference to the “shoe on the other foot” test. How would liberal Democrats react if those or similar prosecutorial tactics were being used against a president Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe risks of running as Trump-lite If another 9/11 happened in a divided 2021, could national unity be achieved again? Schumer remembers 9/11: 'Oh my God, this is World War III' MORE? I know the answer because I have seen how liberal Democrats reacted when President Bill ClintonWilliam (Bill) Jefferson ClintonWhat's at stake — and in play — for the midterms Without drastic changes, Democrats are on track to lose big in 2022 Bidens, former presidents mark 9/11 anniversary MORE was being investigated and impeached. The shoe was, indeed, on the other foot. Some of the same liberal Democrats, who today are justifying everything Mueller is doing, expressed outrage when the special prosecutor in the Clinton case employed similar tactics. Nor did all conservative Republicans pass the “shoe on the other foot” test as many applauded these tactics when directed against Democrats. So back to the question of whether citizens who care about civil liberties should favor the tactics used by the FBI against Flynn. I believe the answer should be no. The function of law enforcement is to uncover past crimes, not to provide citizens the opportunity to commit new crimes by testing their veracity. There may be extraordinary situations, such as prevention of mass casualty terrorism, that justifies the use of highly questionable tactics but, absent such extraordinary circumstances, FBI agents and prosecutors should not deliberately provide citizens the opportunity to commit federal crimes in order to turn them into government witnesses. When questioning any suspect, officials should not ask questions whose answers they already know, for the sole purpose of seeing whether the suspect will lie. If they do ask such questions, untruthful answers should not be deemed “material” to the investigation, because the FBI already knew the truth. The FBI should not discourage the suspect from having his lawyer present during the questioning, if a false answer will subject him to criminal liability. Even noble ends do not justify ignoble means, and some of the means used by the special counsel have, indeed, been ignoble. NOTE: This post has been updated from the original to clarify that, already knowing the truth, the FBI gave Flynn the opportunity to lie to a federal agent to squeeze him for other information.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved President Obama is calling for new Coast Guard icebreakers for the Arctic, citing the growing number of Russian ships in the area, as both powers make a play for the rapidly changing polar region. A White House fact sheet released on Tuesday morning pointed out that the number of icebreakers the U.S. has operated in the region has dramatically dropped since World War II, when the U.S. had as many as seven there. Today, the Coast Guard technically has three icebreakers in its fleet, but when age and reliability are taken into account, the fleet is down to only two fully functional icebreakers and only one heavy-duty icebreaker, it said. \"Russia, on the other hand, has forty icebreakers and another eleven planned or under construction,\" it said. The melting of Arctic sea ice is expected to lead to a dramatic increase in sea traffic in the coming years, and global powers are moving to maintain access if not to control the new waterways. \"The growth of human activity in the Arctic region will require highly engaged stewardship to maintain the open seas necessary for global commerce and scientific research, allow for search and rescue activities, and provide for regional peace and stability,\" the White House said. \"That is why the Administration will propose to accelerate acquisition of a replacement heavy icebreaker to 2020 from 2022, begin planning for construction of additional icebreakers, and call on Congress to work with the Administration to provide sufficient resources to fund these critical investments.\" \"These heavy icebreakers will ensure that the United States can meet our national interests, protect and manage our natural resources, and strengthen our international, state, local, and tribal relationships,\" it added. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee who has long called for increasing the number of Coast Guard icebreakers, applauded the announcement. “As human activity in the Arctic grows, so, too, does the need for American leadership,\" he said in a statement. \"A robust national fleet of icebreakers will be central to enhancing our capabilities in the region and positioning the U.S. to play a meaningful role in the responsible stewardship of this new frontier. \"I welcome the President’s call today and look forward to working with his Administration and members of Congress to see that the appropriate resources are provided to ensure a strong fleet of icebreakers in the years and decades to come,\" he added. U.S. concerns about Russia have been growing since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year, its annexation of the Crimean peninsula and its ongoing support for pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Military leaders say they now see Russia as a top threat to national security, and lawmakers and state officials have been expressing concern about a Russian build-up in the Arctic. Gov. Bill Walker (I) of Alaska, who traveled to Anchorage with Obama on Air Force One on Monday, said he was concerned that Russia has been building up its military presence in the region, as the U.S. appeared to be drawing down. “It’s the biggest buildup of the Russian military since the Cold War,” Walker told The New York Times. “They’re reopening 10 bases and building four more, and they’re all in the Arctic, so here we are in the middle of the pond, feeling a little bit uncomfortable.” This is in addition to large-scale Russian military exercises involving tens of thousands of troops, dozens of ships and submarines, and more than 100 aircraft in the region, according to a Fox News report. Moscow also submitted a claim to the United Nations on Aug. 5 for 463,000 square miles of the Arctic sea shelf — more than 350 nautical miles from the country's shore, according to the report. The Arctic is believed to hold up to 25 percent of the world's untapped oil and gas supplies. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved A conservative lawmaker publicly resigned from the House Freedom Caucus on Wednesday, and criticized the group's tactics — including its demands that funds for Planned Parenthood be blocked as part of a bill to keep the government open. Rep. Tom McClintockThomas (Tom) Milller McClintockThe right fire to fight fire — why limiting prescribed burning is short-sighted Hillicon Valley: House advances six bills targeting Big Tech after overnight slugfest | Google to delay cookie phase out until 2023 | Appeals court rules against Baltimore Police Department aerial surveillance program California Democrats clash over tech antitrust fight MORE (R-Calif.) said that the tactics employed by the Freedom Caucus \"have repeatedly undermined the House’s ability to advance them.\" Besides the Planned Parenthood fight, he cited as examples the fight over funding the Department of Homeland Security earlier this year, and battles over the fast-track trade package and the Iran nuclear deal. The fight over Planned Parenthood risks a government shutdown on Oct. 1 — it is unclear how the House GOP will move a spending bill given the demands from conservative lawmakers. McClintock said the Freedom Caucus's strategy has ultimately empowered Democrats by making it harder for House Republicans to control the legislative process. \"A common theme through each of these incidents is a willingness — indeed, an eagerness — to strip the House Republican majority of its ability to set the House agenda by combining with House Democrats on procedural motions. As a result, it has thwarted vital conservative policy objectives and unwittingly become Nancy Pelosi’s tactical ally,\" McClintock wrote. \"I feel that the HFC’s many missteps have made it counterproductive to its stated goals and I no longer wish to be associated with it,\" the California Republican concluded. McClintock noted that members of the Freedom Caucus perhaps ironically found themselves on the same side of a vote as Democrats during the debate earlier this year over blocking President Obama's immigration executive actions through a Department of Homeland Security funding bill. A three-week stopgap measure pushed by House GOP leaders melted down on the House floor when 52 Republicans and nearly all Democrats voted against it. \"At the behest of its board, most HFC members combined with House Democrats to defeat this effort, resulting in the full funding of these illegal orders for the fiscal year,\" McClintock wrote. He predicted that the Freedom Caucus's decision to oppose any government spending bill this month that includes Planned Parenthood funding in the wake of controversial videos regarding the use of fetal tissue donations would be similarly counterproductive. \"I have strongly opposed the public funding of abortions throughout my 29 years in public office, but this tactic promises only to shield Senate Democrats from their responsibility for a government shutdown and to alienate the public from the pro-life cause at precisely the time when undercover videos of Planned Parenthood’s barbaric practices are turning public opinion in our favor,\" McClintock said. The House Freedom Caucus is made up of about 40 members, but the group keeps its membership secret and highly selective. Multiple conservatives formed the group earlier this year following complaints that the Republican Study Committee — which was the original group intended to keep a check on GOP leaders — became so large some members felt it no longer served its initial purpose.

All Rights Reserved The Texas 2nd Court of Appeals has upheld a conviction against a woman who says she inadvertently voted illegally on two occasions, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced Tuesday. Rosa Maria Ortega, a green card holder who was born in Mexico and brought to the U.S. as an infant, was convicted in 2017 and sentenced to eight years in prison. The Texas 2nd Court of Appeals upheld that conviction in a ruling dated Nov. 21. Ortega maintained that she mistakenly voted illegally, saying that she marked the \"citizen\" box on her ballots because she is a resident. Ortega voted in five elections since 2004, including for Paxton in a 2014 primary, her attorney told The Washington Post last year. Ortega's attorney, Clark Birdsall, also told the Post that the eight-year sentence she received was \"off the rails.\" “It’s a single vote that she’s casting,\" Birdsall told the newspaper at the time. “The fact that she got eight years is off the rails.\" Paxton, in a statement Tuesday, praised the conviction, which critics have said is too harsh, as a necessary crackdown against illegal voting. “This case underscores the importance that Texans place on the institution of voting, and the hallowed principle that every citizen’s vote must count,” Paxton said. “We will hold those accountable who falsely claim eligibility and purposely subvert the election process in Texas.” View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved As Brutus from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar said, perhaps ironically, “There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.” Only a fool would fail to see the decaying political discourse in America and the sharp partisan divides. These divides in America have become so overt and tense that the arts have become outlets to express partisan anger in an ever-increasingly distasteful manner. Since the inauguration of President Trump, Madonna spoke of blowing up the White House, Snoop Dogg assassinated a clown resembling Trump in a music video, and Kathy Griffin held up a severed head that resembled President Trump in a photograph, all under the auspices of the “resistance.” Last week, the Republican baseball team was nearly massacred by a man who clearly had targeted them for their political views. The escalation of both rhetoric and violence should be alarming to any rational citizen. Over the past weekend, supporters of Trump aimed to directly combat Shakespeare in the Park in New York City, in which Julius Caesar, dressed to resemble Trump, is assassinated on stage. Their tactic? Rushing the stage and interrupting the performance while yelling things such as “stop leftist violence!” and, “Goebbels would be proud!” Their actions did not calm and tone down the rhetoric: they only furthered it. Ironically enough, these same people belong to a base that was vocal and united against campus protesters who employed the same tactics to shut down and harass conservative speakers. It’s worth mentioning that the very same production did the same thing to an actor resembling President Obama, and no public outcry took place. The directors of the play used the modern context of the presidency to illustrate the play’s point, although continuing to do so in the wake of last week’s violence was distasteful and unnecessary. Laura Loomer, the woman who first rushed the stage, claimed on Fox News: “I am protecting the president’s life. I am protecting our Constitution. I am using my constitutional right of free speech and protest to protest against the bastardization of Shakespeare.” These claims are as ridiculous as they are false. The Secret Service protects the president’s life, not stage-rushing playgoers. Shakespeare in the Park is a free event, albeit one that requires tickets from its attendees. As a closed event, any interruption cannot be described as an exercise of free speech, but instead an act that infringes on the rights of those who are attending the event. The producers of the play had already come under immense pressure and were already losing sponsors. By rushing the stage, the narrative switched from the disturbing act of the play, to silly protesters shouting down the play itself in the name of “free speech.” Perhaps these protesters should have better studied Julius Caesar. The play portrays the assassination of the historic Roman leader, but focuses on the infighting and strife that ensues among the assassins. The play’s tragedy is not Caesar himself, but rather the friendships, and eventually the lives, of those who wished to seize power. It is itself a condemnation of political violence. In the aftermath of what was obviously a publicity stunt, Loomer used her airtime on Fox News to bash the “never-Trumpers” who she claimed are “unhappy with President Trump being our president. “They haven’t accepted it and the only way that they would be resolved is if he was eradicated or taken out,” she said. I voted for Trump. Supporting our president and supporting free speech are not mutually exclusive. Americans who chose to not vote for Trump have the same rights to free speech as those who voted for him. The “get in line or else” mentality on display is the very sort of behavior that fuels the hyperpartisan rhetoric originally at fault. “Fight fire with fire” is the mantra these demonstrators have used to defend their actions. This sort of logic (if you can call it that) is only furthering the downward spiral of political discourse. After the many times the right has claimed to be the champions of free speech, this sort of behavior is unbelievably hypocritical. Discourse in America, on both sides, is seriously flawed. Taking away others’ free speech is not the solution. You can fight back with outrage and strength while upholding decency and respecting the rights of others.

In an interview with The Hill, Gosar attributed the burgeoning support to the Department of Justice’s controversial snooping on The Associated Press and Fox News. “Americans have lost faith in our chief law enforcement officer. He’s contradicted himself in front of Congress,” said Gosar, who launched the resolution in the wake of the Justice Department’s botched “Fast and Furious” gun-tracking operation. More from The Hill: ♦ Senators want more oversight of Chinese takeover of Smithfield Foods ♦ Credit unions see Elizabeth Warren as ally against 'regulatory tidal wave' ♦ Obama calls climate change the 'global threat of our time' ♦ GOP slams 'significant change' to carbon costs in federal regs ♦ Dems start Obama to Clinton transition ♦ Jimmy Carter wants sanctions eased on terrorist groups One of the recent co-sponsors is Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), who heads the Judiciary subcommittee that the measure was referred to. It remains unclear whether Sensenbrenner will move the motion and if GOP leaders will bring it to the floor. Gosar said he is focused on getting as many co-sponsors as he can. Not one Democrat has backed the legislation, but Gosar is optimistic that will change. He said he has been reaching out to Democrats who voted to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress last year. The contempt motion passed 255-67, with the support of 17 Democrats. Even if the House passes the Gosar measure, it is unlikely to move in the Democratic-led Senate. President Obama, meanwhile, has publicly defended his attorney general, saying last month that he has “complete confidence in Eric Holder.” View the discussion thread.

Jim MathesonJames (Jim) David MathesonMcAdams concedes to Owens in competitive Utah district Trump EPA eases standards for coal ash disposal Utah redistricting reform measure likely to qualify for ballot MORE (D-Utah) will be replacing Jo Ann Emerson as the CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), the trade group announced on Monday. Matheson, who joined top K Street firm Squire Patton Boggs after retiring from Congress last year, begins in the role next month. He is the sixth CEO of the group. “Jim will bring to the position a broad knowledge of the issues facing rural America and will be an inspirational leader for America’s Electric Cooperatives,” NRECA President Mel Coleman said in a statement. Emerson, a former Republican congresswoman from Missouri, resigned from her House seat in January 2013 to take the helm of the organization. Elected in 1996, she had been the longest-serving member of Missouri’s congressional delegation. She earned a $1.3 million salary from NRECA in 2014, according to the most recent tax forms available. Last year, Emerson suffered a brain hemorrhage while on vacation in Italy, and NRECA cited a “severe illness” as her reason for stepping down. During his 14-year tenure on Capitol Hill, Matheson sat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Prior to that, he had experience working with the energy industry, including at his own consulting firm. “The respect Matheson has on both sides of the aisle, and his ability to bridge political and policy divides to find common ground, will serve NRECA and all member cooperatives very well,” NRECA said in the release about his hire. Matheson, who became eligible to lobby his former colleagues this year, is listed as advocating on behalf of Airlines for America, Duke Energy, Salt Lake Community College, United Health Group, among others, at Squire Patton Boggs. Former Sens.

In a statement, Matheson said he is “excited by the opportunity to lead NRECA.” “I am honored to be associated with this member-driven organization that has a strong reputation for quality and integrity,” he continued. “I look forward to working collaboratively with all of the cooperative community as we look to the future.” — This post was updated at 5:39 p.m. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved More than half of the nation’s governors have moved to at least temporarily block Syrian refugees from resettling in their states, according to a tally compiled by The Hill. The 28 governors — 27 Republicans and one Democrat — have indicated they want to prioritize the safety of residents in their states amid heightened fears of international terrorism. Many of them have called on the federal government to review its screening process as President ObamaBarack Hussein ObamaWhat's at stake — and in play — for the midterms Without drastic changes, Democrats are on track to lose big in 2022 By defeating Newsom recall, pro-choice women would send a powerful message MORE moves forward with plans to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees into the U.S. over the next year. The Obama administration has suggested the governors don't have the authority to turn away the refugees, and some Republicans have acknowledged that could be an issue. But the mounting pressure from the governors could spur action in Congress to halt the refugee program. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Tuesday that the House is likely to vote this week on legislation that would temporarily halt the resettlement plan to ensure that the vetting process is sufficiently thorough. The debate over refugees erupted after last week's deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, where one attacker may have slipped into Europe with a group of Syrian refugees. “My heart says that we should let these people in,” Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said Tuesday during an interview on CNN's “New Day.” “But my head says that I have to protect the people of the state of Alabama and keep them secure.” Bentley and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) on Sunday became the first to formally announce their opposition to refugees being resettled in their states. Others joined Monday, including several governors running for the White House: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan is the only Democrat to join group, and has called for pausing refugee resettlement until the vetting process is reviewed. Hassan is running against Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) for the Senate in a race that will help decide control of the upper chamber. Democratic governors of several states including Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware have signaled that they would still welcome the refugees. Others, such as Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, have indicated the same, though they have focused on safety precautions. In Kentucky, outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear (D) signaled that the state would admit those who have been screened. But Gov.-elect Matt Bevin (R) said in a statement that he backed a \"vigilant\" approach to blocking refugees until a more thorough risk assessment. Governors are also demanding greater coordination on resettlement, as several have indicated they are open to supporting refugees being sent to their states after a stronger vetting process is established. “While screening, acceptance and placement is legally under the authority of the federal government, they have said in the past they would be open to cooperating with receiving states,” Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam said in a statement. “Right now there's almost no coordination or communication between the state and federal officials on this issue,” North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said Tuesday morning on Fox News. Efforts on the part of the Obama administration to quell concerns may not be enough in some states. In Louisiana, Jindal issued an executive order for government agencies to use \"all lawful means\" to keep Syrian refugees out and told state police to \"monitor and avert threats\" posed by those already in the state. “It's fair for the governors to ask the question – what type of background check can you do when individuals [are] coming from a country that's torn apart?” McCrory asked Tuesday on CNN. “What types of background checks are you actually going through?” Obama has sharply criticized the calls to keep out the refugees, saying the country should help people who are fleeing the carnage of Syria’s civil war. “Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values,” Obama said Monday in Turkey. He also said the refugees would be allowed into the country only after \"rigorous\" vetting. Here is the full list of governors who want to prevent the resettlement of refugees in their states: Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson Florida Gov. Rick Scott Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal Idaho Gov. Butch Otter Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal Maine Gov.

Walker's campaign sent an email requesting donations Sunday night. The email from Friends of Scott Walker, which runs his reelection campaign, said the governor \"refuses to be distracted by the small, petty, and pale ideas that the 'gotcha' headline writers for the Liberal Media want to talk about.\" The Wisconsin governor has drawn scrutiny for refusing to say whether he agrees with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's comments questioning whether President Obama loves America. Giuliani's remarks came at an event attended by Walker. Over the weekend, Walker drew further scrutiny when he refused to say whether he thought Obama was a Christian. He also decided to punt on questions about evolution during a recent trip to London. Walker is considering a run for the White House in 2016. Some are questioning whether Walker's moves have been beneficial — but his campaign is looking to frame it as a moral stand. \"He refuses to be drawn into the sideshow of answering pointless questions about whether and how much President Obama loves our country. To Governor Walker, what matters are ideas, issues, his record, and results,\" the email from Friends of Scott Walker continued. \"Now is the time to stand up against the publicity hounds and the journalistic pack, and help Governor Walker fight back.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Support for same-sex marriage in the United States has reached a record high, according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday. The survey found that 70 percent of respondents in the U.S. said that marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized by the law as valid, an increase of 3 percentage points from June 2020. Gallup found that the latest increase in support for same-sex marriage was driven by Republicans, with 55 percent saying it should be recognized as valid. This is the first time Gallup recorded a majority of Republicans supporting same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, 73 percent of independents expressed support for same-sex marriage, up slightly from the 68- to 71-percent range recorded over the past few years. In addition, 83 percent of Democrats expressed support for same-sex marriage, remaining steady over the past few years. Gallup first began gauging Americans’ views on same-sex marriage in 1996, finding at the time that only 27 percent of Americans supported legal recognition of gay and lesbian marriages. Gallup said it first recorded a majority support for gay marriage in 2011. When the Supreme Court ruled that all states must recognize same-sex marriage in 2015, support for gay marriage reached 60 percent. Gallup’s latest poll surveyed 1,016 adults between May 3-18, 2021. The margin of sampling error is 4 percentage points. View the discussion thread.

The Hill's 12:30 Report - Presented by AT&T - US enters nerve-wracking final hours in Afghanistan Former Afghanistan ambassador to US: Afghan women 'are in a state of panic' MORE is ripping the Conservative Political Action Conference's decision to invite far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at the annual meeting. In a series of tweets Sunday night, Tapper slammed the invite after a video surfaced of the Breitbart editor appearing to defend pedophilia. Tapper said he initially wanted to avoid discussing the revelation, but was urged to speak out by an unnamed friend, who Tapper said is a victim of sexual abuse. Friend of mine, conservative, could not be more distraught by this Milo tape. Was molested as a child. Horrified. My friend, a survivor of sex trafficking: \"Milo straight up defended abusing 13 yr old boys...Please don't let that be normalized\" More from survivor of sex trafficking: \"Please please please don't let that mess he said go away.\"How on earth can CPAC defend this? Was planning on ignoring for the most part, for those saying \"stop publicizing him.\" But friend reached out & pled w me to say something And sometimes that's what journalists do - give voice to the voiceless. In this case, a survivor of sex trafficking HORRIFIED by Milo. Preying on children is the definition of evil. Justifying it in any way is sick and disturbing. Has everyone lost their minds? In the video, Yiannopoulos, who is gay, discusses how relationships with older men can be beneficial for young homosexuals who may not have support at home, and later mentions his own sexual abuse as a teenager. “We get hung up on this sort of child abuse stuff to the point where we are heavily policing consensual adults,” Yiannopoulos says in the video. “In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men – the sort of ‘coming of age’ relationship – those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can’t speak to their parents,” he continues. One of the podcast’s hosts then tells Yiannopoulos that his comment “sounds like Catholic priest molestation.” \"I'm grateful for Father Michael,\" Yiannopoulos says in response. \"I wouldn't give nearly such good head if it wasn't for him.\" The clip is part of a nearly three-hour interview aired on a January 2016 episode of the popular “Drunken Peasants” podcast, and has been on the video streaming service YouTube for over a year. It re-surfaced on Sunday when a conservative blog tweeted it amid news that Yiannopoulos was set to speak at CPAC. Breaking: We obtained the #CPAC2017 Milo Yiannopoulos introductory video. This is a must watch! Well done @mschlapp. pic.twitter.com/2nA0H9woUX Soon after the video was reposted, a board member of the American Conservative Union, the organization that plans the high-profile conference, tweeted that the board of directors was never consulted on the decision to have Yiannopoulos speak at the event. This is why you consult board members.  There's nothing about this that's amusing. This isn't about free speech. This is about basic decency.  Yiannopoulos has defended his comments, saying he has never and would never defend child abusers. He said he was joking on the podcast when he discussed oral sex, saying it was no different than the gallows humor that might be used by those suffering from AIDS. He said he should not have used the word \"boy,\" which he said gays often use when referring to consenting adults. \"I understand that heterosexual people might not know that, so it was a sloppy choice of words that I regret,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"This rush to judgment from establishment conservatives who hate Trump as much as they hate me, before I have had any chance to provide context or a response, is one of the big reasons gays vote Democrat,\" he wrote.

But, he added, “I am afraid that the Democrats will draw the conclusion … that we shouldn’t do anything. I completely disagree with that. “The Democrats may have to give up some short-term political gain by whipping up fear, if it’s a reasonable Social Security proposal, if it’s a reasonable Medicare proposal. You cannot have healthcare devour the economy,” he said. But Clinton insisted that Medicare costs have to be dealt with to get a grip on budget deficits. The former president charged that Republicans are being haunted by their decision to distort the Obama healthcare reforms to Medicare Advantage in the 2010 election. “The Republicans ran to the left of the Democrats,” he noted. He reiterated a complaint that Democrats did not do enough on the campaign trail to explain the changes. Democrats favor reining in healthcare costs by strengthening the power of the Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board to restrict payments.Clinton said that Medicare and Medicaid reform can be done only as part of a plan to reduce healthcare cost inflation.The former president, speaking at a fiscal summit convened by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said he believes there will be a bipartisan deficit deal. He argued that the pain of cuts should be delayed until the economic recovery has taken root.The “genius of Bowles-Simpson,” Clinton said, referring to the fiscal commission plan, is that it makes “big changes,” but delays them.Clinton said politicians should not be held captive to polls that show the public is against raising the debt ceiling, and he said that President Obama may need to give an address on the consequences of a default.He also said that one of the worst things about the growing national debt is the fact that the nation owes money to countries that have a trade surplus with the United States.He said the U.S. has reduced trade-agreement enforcement over a decade due to fear of its creditors. “Nobody slugs their banker,” he said.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Hard-line House GOP conservatives aren’t worried about a looming Department of Homeland Security shutdown as the deadline for congressional action draws near. Many of the conservative lawmakers who most want to aggressively challenge President Obama's executive actions on immigration think that if push comes to shove, a shutdown will be worth the fight.And at this point, they don't think there will be any electoral consequences if there is a shutdown.ADVERTISEMENT\"I'm just not that scared of sticking to principles and filling campaign promises that we made back home, irrespective of what leadership tells us to do here,\" said Rep. Curt Clawson (R-Fla.).\"It's worth having this fight,\" said Rep. Paul GosarPaul Anthony GosarPolice brace for Capitol rally defending Jan. 6 mob Watchdog group seeks ethics probe over McCarthy's Jan. 6 comments Jan. 6 panel seeks records of those involved in 'Stop the Steal' rally MORE (R-Ariz.).Gone are assurances from Republican lawmakers that there won't be a shutdown later this month.Most DHS employees are considered \"essential,\" meaning that workers like border patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration employees would remain on the job, albeit without pay. So in the eyes of some lawmakers, a DHS shutdown wouldn't have as much impact as the government-wide shutdown in 2013.\"The shutdown would be extremely limited. It would be only in one department, with only a small percentage of people in that one department. But again, nobody has a goal here of shutting anything down. The goal here is to get the president to get right with the Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold,\" said Rep. John FlemingJohn Calvin FlemingLobbying world Trump wants Congress to delay Census deadlines amid pandemic Meadows sets up coronavirus hotline for members of Congress MORE (R-La.).Of course, many Republicans in the House and Senate think allowing DHS to shut down would be a bad idea.ADVERTISEMENT\"I think a shutdown would be a huge mistake for a whole host of reasons, especially given the fact we have ISIS on the march and terrorism again in Europe,\" said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), who voted against language last month to freeze a program allowing illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to obtain work permits.\"This strategy was never designed to succeed. Everybody knows that. So now we have to face the reality and do what the American public sent us here to do, which is to govern and fund the Homeland Security department,\" Dent told The Hill.Sen.

It’s not acceptable,\" Kirk said of a potential shutdown. \"When you’re in the majority, you have to govern. You have to govern responsibly. And shutdowns are not responsible.\"The complacency extends to the coming week's congressional recess. Lawmakers of all political stripes said they weren't worried about spending all of next week in their districts for the Presidents' Day holiday. Congress will have just four days to find a solution before funding for DHS would lapse after Feb. 27. Even Dent didn't think it was necessary to cancel next week's recess, noting that Congress can move quickly when it wants to.\"We have time to do it,\" Dent said of the DHS funding. \"Leadership on both sides needs to make a decision about what the path forward is. Once they determine that path forward, it shouldn't take long to enact the legislation.\"By contrast, both chambers of Congress canceled a recess in September 2013 similarly close to the deadline that ultimately resulted in the first government shutdown in 17 years.And yet only one lawmaker suggested that Congress should stay in Washington and keep working to solve the impasse.\"Forget about recess,\" Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said at an event held with the Heritage Foundation this week. \"Imagine what the American people will think about our party, the Republican Party, if we stay here for a week, we decide not to go on recess, and we actually fight for the principles that the American people sent us here to fight for.\"When it returns, the Senate will vote for a fourth time to proceed to the House-passed DHS funding bill with language to revoke President Obama's immigration actions. It is expected to fall short of the necessary 60 votes, just like the other three votes.But Fleming refused to acknowledge that the strategy won't take them any farther.\"I was elected to represent my district, not to predict the future,\" Fleming said when a reporter pointed out that the fourth vote would fail like the others.Despite taking a lot of heat for the 2013 shutdown over ObamaCare, Republicans ultimately never paid the price at the ballot box in last year's elections. But Democrats like Rep. Luis GutierrezLuis Vicente GutierrezBiden's inauguration marked by conflict of hope and fear The Hill's Campaign Report: Democratic primary fight shifts to South Carolina, Nevada Democrats rally behind incumbents as Lipinski takes liberal fire MORE (D-Ill.) think a shutdown of DHS would hurt the GOP in the long run.\"Don't think there's going to be another rollout of ObamaCare. They got lucky the last time they shut down the government. They were able to change the conversation to the incredibly, how would I say it, not too nicely rolled out ObamaCare. So they won't have that opportunity a second time,\" Gutierrez said.Gutierrez warned that shutting down DHS over a fight about immigration would haunt Republicans in the 2016 elections. \"It is clear to me that come the presidential election of 2016, this will be a cardinal issue in the debate,\" Gutierrez said. Labrador maintained that aggressively challenging the president is good politics for Republicans, who just started the new Congress with a new Senate majority and the largest House majority since the early 20th century.\"It's pretty simple: When you fight for what you believe in, you win elections,\" Labrador said.

All Rights Reserved President TrumpDonald TrumpHouse Democrats eye 26.5 percent corporate tax rate Iran accepts deal on nuclear monitoring, avoids censure Old South vs. the new America: What Confederate monuments say about us MORE reportedly warned Russian President Vladimir Putin during a phone call last week that if the two Cold War foes were to reignite the arms race, the U.S. would come out on top. NBC News reported Thursday that Putin's claim of new nuclear-capable weapons that can reach the United States \"really got under the president's skin,\" according to one official. \"If you want to have an arms race we can do that, but I'll win,\" Trump reportedly told his Russian counterpart. The comment came in the same phone call in which Trump congratulated Putin for his recent win in Russia's presidential election, despite warnings in his briefing material not to do so. Trump told reporters after that call that the two men had \"a very good call\" and that he was planning to meet with Putin in the near future — a remark that reportedly caught his advisers off guard. Russia's election was considered fundamentally flawed by international observers, and critics said Trump shouldn't be congratulating Putin while his country is under sanctions over its 2016 election meddling. In a pair of tweets a day after his call with Putin, Trump insisted that improving U.S.-Russia relations \"is a good thing,\" and that he would be able to succeed where his predecessors had failed. But he also alluded to a \"coming Arms Race\" without making it clear what he meant. I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing....... .....They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race. Bush tried to get along, but didn’t have the “smarts.” Obama and Clinton tried, but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET). PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH! Tensions between Russia and the West have heightened in recent weeks, following the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter with a military-grade nerve agent in Salisbury, England. Western officials have blamed that attack on Moscow, though the Russian government has denied any role in it. Trump moved this week to expel 60 Russian officials from the U.S. in retaliation for the poisonings, joining a coordinated effort by two-dozen countries. On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced that Moscow would respond in kind, by expelling 60 U.S. diplomats and shuttering the American consulate in St. Petersburg. He said Russia would take similar actions against other countries that expelled Russian diplomats this week. According to NBC News, Trump has been seeking ways to take a stronger line with Russia without angering Putin. Trump reportedly still sees improved relations with the Kremlin as a net gain for America, and hopes to move forward with the relationship in the future. View the discussion thread.

Asked if the country stood on sturdier ground under former President Obama's leadership, McCain said \"yes,\" according to the report. “As far as American leadership is concerned, yes,\" said McCain, though he vocally criticized many of the Obama administration's foreign policy decisions. McCain also lost to Obama when he ran as the GOP nominee in the 2008 presidential election. The Arizona Republican was also asked what \"message\" the president delivered to the U.K. last week when he publicly criticized London's mayor, shortly after a terror-related attack that left eight people dead and many more wounded. “What do you think the message is? The message is that America doesn’t want to lead,” said McCain, chairman on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “They are not sure of American leadership, whether it be in Siberia or whether it be in Antarctica,” he added. Trump criticized London Mayor Sadiq Khan's comment that Londoners should not be alarmed by the increased police presence following the attack by taking the statement out of context. Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his \"no reason to be alarmed\" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it! Trump also used the two recent attacks in the United Kingdom to renew his push to ban refugees and immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries. View the discussion thread.

Ted CruzRafael (Ted) Edward CruzAllies see rising prospect of Trump 2024 White House bid Why is Biden hesitating to challenge China as East Asia's major trade partner? Chris Wallace on lawmakers who contested Biden's election: I don't want to hear 'their crap' MORE (R-Texas), emerging as a key player in negotiations to repeal and replace ObamaCare, says Vice President Pence should exert his power over the Senate to significantly expand the scope of the House healthcare reform bill. Cruz, who had dinner with President Trump on Wednesday evening, says that Pence, who by virtue of his office also serves as president of the Senate, should be prepared to overrule the chamber's parliamentarian to bulk up the controversial measure. House Republicans left several reforms popular with conservatives out of their healthcare bill because the parliamentarian is likely to rule them outside the scope of special rules in the upper chamber that prevent a Democratic filibuster. Cruz argues that Pence, as the person likely to preside over the chamber at the most important moments of the healthcare debate, can decide what is and what isn’t eligible for the so-called reconciliation process. He says the Senate parliamentarian’s role is to advise, not to rule. “Under the Budget Act of 1974, which is what governs reconciliation, it is the presiding officer, the vice president of the United States, who rules on what’s permissible on reconciliation and what is not,” Cruz told reporters Thursday. “That’s a conversation I’ve been having with a number of my colleagues.\" Republicans control only 52 seats in the Senate, where most controversial legislation needs 60 votes to overcome filibusters by the minority party.

Capitol Police warning of potential for violence during rally backing rioters: report MORE (R-Ky.) plans to circumvent the 60-vote threshold and pass the healthcare measure by using the budget reconciliation process. But only legislation that has more than an incidental impact on federal spending or revenue can be protected from filibusters. Cruz declined to say specifically whether he brought up his plan directly with Trump at dinner, only acknowledging, “I’ve been visiting with leaders throughout the administration.” The Senate parliamentarian has played a high-profile — and high-pressure — role in past legislative debates. In 2001, then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) fired parliamentarian Bob Dove after he delivered rulings that frustrated the GOP. One decision held that only one tax bill could be protected through reconciliation. Cruz says that Republicans don’t need to fire parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough if she rules that GOP-favored reforms, such as allowing insurance companies to sell across state lines or repealing the mandate on insurance companies to provide coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions, must meet a 60-vote, instead of a 51-vote, threshold. He says Pence can simply make his own interpretation of Senate rules and set aside the parliamentarian’s advice if he disagrees. “You don’t have to override the parliamentarian or get a new parliamentarian,” Cruz said. “Under the statute, it is the vice president who rules. It is the presiding officer who makes the decision. The parliamentarian advises on that question.” It would be difficult for Democrats to overturn Pence's decisions. They would need to muster 60 votes to reverse him, and they only control 48 seats, including the Independents who caucus with them. Cruz says that repealing the insurance mandate, which bars insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, and allowing people to buy plans across state lines will reduce the cost of health insurance and have a clear budgetary impact. Medical malpractice tort reform, another idea popular with conservatives, could then also be included in the healthcare reform bill, Cruz said. “Every one of these reforms has an enormous budgetary impact. An impact of billions of dollars if not hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said. Senate Democrats rejected Cruz’s proposal as a direct violation of Senate precedent. “Then anything could be subject to reconciliation,” said a senior Democratic aide. “You could authorize war with a simple majority and argue that it affects spending.” The aide called Cruz’s idea “outlandish and not going to happen.” View the discussion thread.

Mook argued that Clinton frequently sits for interviews on political talk shows, meets with individual reporters, and “occasionally” joins reporters embedded in her campaign. “Secretary Clinton has provided a variety of interviews, one-on-one with reporters already,” Mook said. “She speaks occasionally with her traveling press corps, so we continue to evaluate these questions on an ongoing basis.” Clinton's Republican rival, Donald TrumpDonald TrumpHouse Democrats eye 26.5 percent corporate tax rate Iran accepts deal on nuclear monitoring, avoids censure Old South vs. the new America: What Confederate monuments say about us MORE, criticized the media earlier Wednesday for failing to push Clinton to have press conferences. \"It's been 235 days since Crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference and you as reporters who give her all these glowing reports should ask yourselves why.

All Rights Reserved Texas authorities have threatened to arrest international election observers, prompting a furious response from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). “The threat of criminal sanctions against [international] observers is unacceptable,” Janez Lenarčič, the Director of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), said in a statement. “The United States, like all countries in the OSCE, has an obligation to invite ODIHR observers to observe its elections.” Lawmakers from the group of 56 European and Central Asian nations have been observing U.S. elections since 2002, without incident. Their presence has become a flashpoint this year, however, as Republicans accuse Democrats of voter fraud while Democrats counter that GOP-inspired voter ID laws aim to disenfranchise minority voters. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott further fueled the controversy on Tuesday when he sent a letter to the OSCE warning the organization that its representatives “are not authorized by Texas law to enter a polling place” and that it “may be a criminal offense for OSCE’s representatives to maintain a presence within 100 feet of a polling place's entrance.” More from The Hill: • GOP lawmaker: WH delaying pollution regs to get Obama reelected • Obama supporters worry Romney win will kill parts of health lawBoehnerJohn Andrew BoehnerLobbying world A new kind of hero?

The OSCE put out an interim report last week saying that “recent state-level legislative initiatives to limit early voting and introduce stricter voter identification have become highly polarized.” “The OSCE may be entitled to its opinions about Voter ID laws, but your opinion is legally irrelevant in the United States, where the Supreme Court has already determined that Voter ID laws are constitutional,” Abbott wrote. “If OSCE members want to learn more about our election processes so they can improve their own democratic systems, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the measures Texas has implemented to protect the integrity of elections. However, groups and individuals from outside the United States are not allowed to influence or interfere with the election process in Texas.” Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) also weighed in, tweeting “No UN monitors/inspectors will be part of any TX election process; I commend @Txsecofstate for swift action to clarify issue.” In letters to Abbott and Secretary of State Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonSchumer remembers 9/11: 'Oh my God, this is World War III' Bidens, former presidents mark 9/11 anniversary Why is Biden hesitating to challenge China as East Asia's major trade partner? MORE, whose State Department invited the 44 election observers, Lenarčič reiterated that the group is only there to observe the elections. “Our observers are required to remain strictly impartial and not to intervene in the voting process in any way,” Lenarčič said in a statement. “They are in the United States to observe these elections, not to interfere in them.” State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland sought to tone down the controversy during her briefing Thursday. The department is eager to avoid giving the impression that the United States is unwilling to submit to the same scrutiny it demands of others when it comes to human and civil rights. “Since the initial issue with Texas we've received a letter, both for Secretary Clinton and one for Texas authorities, from the OSCE assuring us and Texas authorities that the OSCE observers are committed to following all U.S. laws and regulations as they do in any country where they observe elections and they will do so as well in Texas,” Nuland said. \"To my knowledge [Texas] is the only state that came forward and said 'please reassure us that you're going to follow our state electoral law.'

Anthony M. Derlunas II, 58, told Baltimore Police that he yelled the slogans because the final scene before intermission reminded him of how much he despises the president, according to The New York Times. The Times noted that Derlunas also claimed that the anger directed at him after he shouted the slogans was because of what he claimed must be a high number of Trump supporters at the show. Derlunas on Wednesday night began yelling from the balcony during the intermission of \"Fiddler on the Roof\" at Baltimore’s Hippodrome Theatre. The cries reportedly led some in the theater to believe that a shooting was about to happen. “I’ll be honest, I was waiting to hear a gunshot. I thought, ‘Here we go,’” Richard Scherr, a contributing sportswriter for the Baltimore Sun who was at the theater, told the newspaper. Derlunas was escorted out of the theater after shouting the slogans. No charges were filed against him, according to reports. \"As reprehensible as the man’s words were, they are considered protected free speech because nobody was directly threatened,” a spokesperson for the Baltimore Police Department told The Times. “Fiddler on the Roof” is a musical based on a Jewish community facing persecution in imperial Russia. The outburst from Derlunas follows a string of anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. In October, a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue left 11 people dead. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved President Donald Trump’s first year in office was deeply disappointing for small business owners. While he promised to advocate for small employers when he took office, he instead focused on a tax bill that benefits large corporations far more than Main Street small businesses. But 2018 is an opportunity for a fresh start, and if President TrumpDonald TrumpHouse Democrats eye 26.5 percent corporate tax rate Iran accepts deal on nuclear monitoring, avoids censure Old South vs. the new America: What Confederate monuments say about us MORE truly wants to tackle small business issues this year, there are several key policies he could promote that would help America’s job creators succeed. First, small businesses need expanded access to responsible sources of capital. A 2016 report from Harvard Business School titled “The State of Small Business Lending” found the small business share of loans fell from 31 percent in 2010 to 21 percent in 2016. The report also found many large banks have stopped making loans under a certain threshold, usually $250,000, ignoring the vast majority of small businesses that seek funding below this threshold. To address this gap, Congress should maintain and expand Small Business Administration (SBA) lending programs and the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund. Last year, President Trump proposed devastating cuts to the CDFI Fund, which would have virtually eliminated one of the best sources of responsible capital for small businesses. Second, health-care marketplaces must be bolstered. This includes guaranteeing payments to insurers for cost-sharing subsidies, which help many solo entrepreneurs and small business employees afford health coverage. Senators Lamar AlexanderLamar AlexanderAuthorities link ex-Tennessee governor to killing of Jimmy Hoffa associate The Republicans' deep dive into nativism Senate GOP faces retirement brain drain MORE (R-Tenn.) and Patty MurrayPatricia (Patty) Lynn MurrayConservation group says it will only endorse Democrats who support .5T spending plan Support the budget resolution to ensure a critical investment in child care Senate Democrats try to defuse GOP budget drama MORE (D-Wash.) have proposed bipartisan legislation that would be a great first step in bolstering the gains small business have seen under the Affordable Care Act. The administration should also avoid taking steps that would make it easier for associations to offer health plans to small businesses, as these plans don’t have to follow rules requiring the coverage of essential health benefits and allow for insurers to charge different premiums based on things like gender or pre-existing conditions. Allowing these association health plans to enroll more small businesses or self-employed individuals would likely create separate risk pools, undermining the small group market and raising costs for small businesses with older or sicker employees. Third, we hope lawmakers will address critically needed infrastructure improvements. Not only do small businesses anchor the supply chain for infrastructure initiatives themselves, they run the hotels, coffee shops, restaurants and other businesses that serve the people working on these projects. The federal government must support infrastructure improvements, particularly projects that would directly benefit small business commercial enterprises. Finally, policymakers should work to make retirement savings and paid family leave programs more available to small employers, since most small employers don’t have the resources to offer these benefits. When it comes to retirement options, we support state efforts to establish publicly administered retirement savings programs so more small businesses and their employees can access retirement plans. To boost the availability of paid family leave, our opinion polling has found that small business owners overwhelmingly support the FAMILY Act, legislation introduced by U.S. Senators Kirsten GillibrandKirsten GillibrandDemocratic senators request probe into Amazon's treatment of pregnant employees The FBI comes up empty-handed in its search for a Jan. 6 plot Hochul touts readiness, distance from Cuomo MORE (D-N.Y.) and Heidi HeitkampMary (Heidi) Kathryn HeitkampProgressives prepare to launch counterattack in tax fight Business groups aim to divide Democrats on .5T spending bill On The Money: Powell signals Fed will soon cut stimulus MORE (D-N.D.), which would provide partial wage replacement for small business employees to access parental leave or to handle serious health conditions for themselves and family members. Most of the programs currently enacted by states don’t burden small businesses because they are funded entirely by modest employee contributions. Small businesses are the foundation of America’s economy, generating the vast majority of new private-sector jobs and spurring innovation in all sectors of the economy. Many of these policies outlined above have bipartisan support and are simple steps President Trump, his administration and Congress could take to encourage an inclusive and thriving economy.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Tuesday's House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on the taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood was interesting. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards faced direct questioning from Republicans and soft kisses from Democrats. The real value of the hearing was that, unlike when Richards appears on TV, this time she was under oath. That yielded several admissions. First, Planned Parenthood often says that abortions are only 3 percent of the services they offer. The Washington Post's \"Fact Checker\" has given this dubious claim \"three Pinocchios.\" When Richards was asked to divide the number of patients Planned Parenthood saw last year by the number of abortions, the answer was 12 percent. Even more amazingly, when federal funds are exempted, 86 percent of Planned Parenthood's revenue comes from abortions. Second, Richards and Planned Parenthood advocates regularly claim that women receive mammograms at Planned Parenthood facilities — as she did on CNN in 2011, to give one example. Asked by freshman Rep. Mia LoveLudmya (Mia) Love'The View' plans series of conservative women as temporary McCain replacements Black Republican advocates his case for CBC membership Black women look to build upon gains in coming elections MORE (R-Utah) if Planned Parenthood facilities offer mammograms, Richards admitted they don't. None of the 650 to 700 facilities offer mammograms, nor do they even have the equipment. Third, Rep. Diane BlackDiane Lynn BlackBottom line Overnight Health Care: Anti-abortion Democrats take heat from party | More states sue Purdue over opioid epidemic | 1 in 4 in poll say high costs led them to skip medical care Lamar Alexander's exit marks end of an era in evolving Tennessee MORE (R-Tenn.), the author of the bill to end taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood by shifting the funding to community health centers, asked Richards to explain her claim that her bill would block access for women's health. Community health centers outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities by at least tenfold, and they offer additional services like mammograms that Planned Parenthood does not offer. Richards had no real answer. Fourth, Rep. Steve RussellSteven (Steve) Dane RussellKendra Horn concedes to Stephanie Bice in Oklahoma, flipping seat back to GOP GOP women's group launches six-figure campaign for House candidate Bice Bice wins Oklahoma GOP runoff to face Horn in November MORE (R-Okla.) asked the single most interesting question of the day: If federal funds do not go to abortion services, would ending federal funding reduce abortion services? He cleverly caught Richards in a trap. Admit that federal funding goes to abortion, and Planned Parenthood is violating federal law. Admit that ending federal funding doesn't reduce abortion services, and you undercut the defense of Planned Parenthood's funding. She had no real answer and was clearly stumped. There were other interesting moments: Planned Parenthood regularly claims that the hidden camera videos that were released were \"selectively edited,\" but two forensic examinations found that to be false. As The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway reported, both forensic reports, including one commissioned by Planned Parenthood, \"assert that there is no dubbing or alteration to the audio and no evidence of misrepresentative editing.\" Tuesday was not a good day for Planned Parenthood. Its boss had to admit a number of things that contradicted her previous public statements and undercut her defense of the organization's practices.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The White House on Thursday warned Israel to stop settlement announcements that could undermine peace with the Palestinians, according to The Jerusalem Post. The surprising statement comes as President Trump signaled he would depart from former President Obama’s Israel policy and forge a close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a strong proponent of settlements. But Trump was reportedly blindsided by Israel’s announcement of 5,500 new housing units to be built in the West Bank, which would have been the first new settlement there in around 20 years. “As President Trump has made clear, he is very interested in reaching a deal that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is currently exploring the best means of making progress toward that goal,” an official told the paper. “With that in mind, we urge all parties from taking unilateral actions that could undermine our ability to make progress, including settlement announcements,” the official added. “The administration needs to have the chance to fully consult with all parties on the way forward.” In a separate statement Thursday, the White House made clear its opposition to the recent burst of settlement activity. But in a departure from the Obama administration, the statement does not call settlements an impediment to a two-state solution. \"While we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.\" \"The Trump administration has not taken an official position on settlement activity and looks forward to continuing discussions, including with Prime Minister Netanyahu when he visits with President Trump later this month.” Trump’s election is believed to have emboldened Netanyahu’s government, which has moved aggressively to expand its settlement activity. Netanyahu is set to meet with Trump at the White House on Feb. 15. Trump signaled during the transition he would make moves to align the U.S. closer with Israel’s government. He announced his intent to nominate David Friedman, a strong settlement supporter, as ambassador to the Jewish state. In December, Trump’s team reportedly pressured Obama to scuttle a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlement construction. But the previous administration allowed the controversial measure to pass, abstaining from the vote. But since entering the White House, Trump has backed off some of his more aggressive promises, including a plan to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump repeatedly said during the campaign he wants his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to help broker a Middle East peace deal. Updated at 6:39 p.m. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved By John SolomonOpinion Contributor To date, Lisa Page’s infamy has been driven mostly by the anti-Donald Trump text messages she exchanged with fellow FBI agent Peter Strzok as the two engaged in an affair while investigating the president for alleged election collusion with Russia. Yet, when history judges the former FBI lawyer years from now, her most consequential pronouncement may not have been typed on her bureau-issued Samsung smartphone to her colleague and lover. Rather, it might be eight simple words she uttered behind closed doors during a congressional interview a few weeks ago. “It’s a reflection of us still not knowing,” Page told Rep. John RatcliffeJohn Lee RatcliffeBiden, Trump battle over who's to blame for Afghanistan Sunday shows preview: US grapples with rising COVID-19 cases Trump-era intelligence chief wants Beijing Olympics moved due COVID-19 'cover-up' MORE (R-Texas) when questioned about texts she and Strzok exchanged in May 2017 as Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerSenate Democrats urge Garland not to fight court order to release Trump obstruction memo Why a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel MORE was being named special counsel to take over the Russia investigation. With that statement, Page acknowledged a momentous fact: After nine months of using some of the most awesome surveillance powers afforded to U.S. intelligence, the FBI still had not made a case connecting Trump or his campaign to Russia’s election meddling. Page opined further, acknowledging “it still existed in the scope of possibility that there would be literally nothing” to connect Trump and Russia, no matter what Mueller or the FBI did. “As far as May of 2017, we still couldn’t answer the question,” she said at another point. I reached out to Page's lawyer, Amy Jeffress, on Friday. She declined to answer questions about her client’s cooperation with Congress. It might take a few seconds for the enormity of Page’s statements to sink in. After all, she isn’t just any FBI lawyer. She was a lead on the Russia case when it started in summer 2016, and she helped it transition to Mueller through summer 2017. For those who might cast doubt on the word of a single FBI lawyer, there’s more. Shortly after he was fired, ex-FBI Director James ComeyJames Brien ComeyGiuliani told investigators it was OK to 'throw a fake' during campaign DOJ watchdog unable to determine if FBI fed Giuliani information ahead of 2016 election Biden sister has book deal, set to publish in April MORE told the Senate there was not yet evidence to justify investigating Trump for colluding with Russia. “When I left, we did not have an investigation focused on President TrumpDonald TrumpHouse Democrats eye 26.5 percent corporate tax rate Iran accepts deal on nuclear monitoring, avoids censure Old South vs. the new America: What Confederate monuments say about us MORE,” Comey testified. And Strzok, the counterintelligence boss and leader of the Russia probe, texted Page in May 2017 that he was reluctant to join Mueller’s probe and leave his senior FBI post because he feared “there’s no big there, there.” The Department of Justice (DOJ) inspector general asked Strzok shortly before he was fired from the FBI what he meant by that text, and he offered a most insightful answer. Strzok said he wasn’t certain there was a “broad, coordinated effort” to hijack the election and that the evidence of Trump campaign aides talking about getting dirt on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe risks of running as Trump-lite If another 9/11 happened in a divided 2021, could national unity be achieved again? Schumer remembers 9/11: 'Oh my God, this is World War III' MORE from Russians might have been just a “bunch of opportunists” talking to heighten their importance. Strzok added that, while he raised the idea of impeachment in some of his texts to Page, “I am, again, was not, am not convinced or certain that it will,” he told the inspector general. So, by the words of Comey, Strzok and Page, we now know that the Trump Justice Department — through Deputy Attorney General Rod RosensteinRod RosensteinWashington still needs more transparency House Judiciary to probe DOJ's seizure of data from lawmakers, journalists The Hill's Morning Report - Biden-Putin meeting to dominate the week MORE — unleashed the Mueller special counsel probe before the FBI could validate a connection between Trump and Russia. Which raises the question: If there was no concrete evidence of collusion, why did we need a special counsel? Page’s comments also mean FBI and Justice officials likely leaked a barrage of media stories just before and after Mueller’s appointment that made the evidence of collusion look far stronger than the frontline investigators knew it to be. Text messages show contacts between key FBI and DOJ players and The Washington Post, The Associated Press and The New York Times during the ramp-up to Mueller’s probe. And that means the news media — perhaps longing to find a new Watergate, to revive sagging fortunes — were far too willing to be manipulated by players in a case that began as a political opposition research project funded by Clinton's campaign and led by a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, who despised Trump. Finally, Page’s statement signals that the nation’s premier intelligence court may not have been given a complete picture of the evidence — or lack thereof — as it approved an extraordinary surveillance intrusion into an American presidential nominee’s campaign just weeks before Election Day. There was no fault to the FBI checking whether Trump was compromised by Russia; that is a classic counterintelligence responsibility. The real fault lies in those leaders who allowed a secret investigation to mushroom into a media maelstrom driven by leaks that created a story that far exceeded the evidence, and then used that false narrative to set a special counsel flying downhill ahead of his skis. No matter where Mueller ends his probe, it is now clear the actions that preceded his appointment turned justice on its head, imposing the presumption of guilt upon a probe whose own originators had reason to doubt the strength of their evidence. John Solomon is an award-winning investigative journalist whose work over the years has exposed U.S. and FBI intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, federal scientists’ misuse of foster children and veterans in drug experiments, and numerous cases of political corruption.

Author Thom Hartmann told Hill.TV that racism and the power of corporate America have been some of the biggest impediments to the United States establishing a national health care system.

All Rights Reserved President Obama said Tuesday that Americans were wrong to doubt his signature healthcare reform law, saying concerns over rising costs or worsening health outcomes were not supported by the evidence. In an interview with Telemundo on Tuesday, the president was asked if \"everybody [was] wrong\" after polling data indicated that a majority of Americans oppose the law and believe it will raise their healthcare costs. \"Yes,\" the president said with a chuckle. \"They are.\" The president said a \"look at the facts\" revealed that young adults were able to stay on their parents' health insurance longer and that seniors were getting \"billions of dollars in discounts on their prescription drugs.\" Asked about reports that insurance rates were rising in some areas, Obama argued the law was a net positive. \"What we've seen is the lowest increase in healthcare costs in 50 years over the last several years,\" Obama said. \"So there is no evidence at all that this is somehow making healthcare more expensive. There's a lot of evidence that it's helping to make it cheaper.\" A poll released Tuesday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal found that just 31 percent of Americans believed ObamaCare was a good idea, while 44 percent thought it was not. Just three in 10 Americans say they understand how the legislation will affect them, and only 23 percent believe the law will have a positive effect on the country's overall healthcare system. Even more concerning for the White House, just 12 percent say the law will have a positive impact on their family, while 52 percent think the cost of their healthcare will go up. State-based exchanges where uninsured Americans will be able to purchase health insurance are scheduled to open Oct. 1, with coverage slated to start at the beginning of 2014. The White House said earlier Tuesday that they expect a massive rollout ahead of the law's implementation, including $1 billion in private advertising and a significant public service campaign. In his interview, the president said that once Americans are able to sign up for the plans, they will realize \"it's gonna be a good deal.\" \"We expect that once it's fully implemented, a year from now, two years from now, five years from now, people will look back and they'll be asking, 'What was the argument about?

All Rights Reserved A new poll of likely voters in Virginia shows a deadlocked battle for governor ahead of the Tuesday election, while several down-ballot races are also tied up. The Roanoke College poll, released Friday, found that Democrat Ralph Northam and Republican Ed Gillespie are tied at 47 percent support apiece with just four days left in the campaign. In addition, Democrat Justin Fairfax and Republican Jill Vogel are tied at 45 percent each in the race to be lieutenant governor, while the race for Virginia's attorney general is tied at 46 percent between the incumbent, Democrat Mark Herring, and Republican John Adams. Gillespie has the edge over Northam when it comes to approval rating. Forty-five percent of Virginians have a favorable view of Gillespie, while 35 percent hold an unfavorable view. That's compared with 38 percent approval and 36 percent disapproval for Northam. The economy and health care were listed as the two top motivating factors behind Virginians' support in the poll. On those issues, 47 percent say Gillespie would do a better job handling the economy, while 39 percent said the same of Northam. Those numbers are almost flipped for health care: 49 percent of Virginians trust Northam over Gillespie on health-care issues, compared to 37 percent who said they trusted Gillespie on health care. President Trump suffers underwater approval ratings in the state. More than half of those surveyed, 53 percent, said they don't approve of the job that Trump is doing, while 36 percent said they approve.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) has been ranked as one of the most conservative senators, a surprising development for a politician who touted his independent reputation.McCain tied for first place along with seven other Republican senators in the National Journal's ranking of the 10 most conservative senators.Notably, his average rank between 2000 and 2007 was the 44th most conservative member of the Senate, according to National Journal, which compiles an annual ranking based on senators' voting records.McCain tacked right in recent votes as he faced a tough primary challenge in the 2010 election cycle. But he wasn't the only senator who became more conservative in his votes -- a change that could be a reflection of the growing influence of the Tea Party movement.Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Saxby Chambilss (R-Ga.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) all jumped from being in the top 20 to tying McCain for first place.Also tied for first: Sens.

Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) in 10th.Notably, among this year's list, four of the senators have either been linked to or shown a strong interest in running for president (or have outright run for president in the case of McCain). Earlier this week, Thune announced that he would not make a 2012 presidential bid; DeMint and Cornyn have also been subject to speculation on the subject.In the House, there was a five-way tie for the most conservative representative this year: Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Sam Johnson (R-Texas), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.), and Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas) were all tied for first.

All Rights Reserved CBS News White House correspondent Major Garrett on Friday said that it \"should be noted\" that the Obama administration attempted to \"demonize\" Fox News regularly. \"There was never an effort to shut me out of the briefing room,\" Garrett told Hill.TV's Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti on \"Rising,\" referring to the Trump White House revoking press credentials from CNN reporter Jim AcostaJames (Jim) AcostaClyburn: 'You may not need .5 trillion to do what the president wants done' Joe Rogan rips CNN over coverage of ivermectin regimen No liberal bias in the media? Who is Chuck Todd kidding, besides himself? MORE. Garrett worked as a White House correspondent at Fox News during the Obama administration. \"The [Obama] White House said it was at war with Fox News. I was its most visible editorial representative on the White House grounds as a senior White House correspondent,\" he continued. \"The White House would always pull me aside and say 'well, really, Major, we're not at war with you,' and I said 'stop talking to me like that because when you're at war with my network you by definition are questioning and assailing my journalistic credibility and the work I do here every day,' \" he said. \" 'So don't tell me it's not about me, it is about me.' \" \"Now, they never tried to pull my pass, but they had this sort of arms-length relationship to Fox and tried to demonize it on a daily basis. So that's another part of American history and journalism in the White House press corps I think at least should be noted at this moment,\" he said. Garrett's comments come amid increased tensions between CNN and the Trump administration. A federal judge ruled Friday morning that the White House had to reinstate Acosta's press pass after it was revoked last week following a testy exchange between Acosta and the president. Fox News, along with other news organizations, backed CNN in the dispute. \"It's not without precedent and it's not without some high-level people saying things [that were] very aggressive about a single news network,\" Garrett said. — Julia Manchester Author Thom Hartmann told Hill.TV that racism and the power of corporate America have been some of the biggest impediments to the United States establishing a national health care system.

Part of that is to indicate and to suggest strongly that a preference be given to teachers to get vaccinated,” Fauci said, though he added it was possible to reopen schools without having all teachers vaccinated beforehand. When asked by Stephanopoulos if schools had the resources available to abide by the new CDC guidelines, Fauci said he did not believe so. “I think that the schools really do need more resources and that's the reason why the national relief act that we're talking about getting passed — we need that.

However, Fauci on Sunday appeared to be optimistic about reopening schools, a move that he has been supportive of throughout the pandemic, arguing the detriment to young students was too great. “I think it can be done. I mean, obviously it's not a perfect situation, but it's really important to get the children back to school in a safest way as possible.

Data from the past year has shown a decline in not only students' academic performance, but also in their mental health and well-being as classes moved online and at-home. Fauci also touched on the rising threat posed by the coronavirus variants from the U.K. and South Africa. He stated that the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer have been shown to be \"clearly\" effective against the U.K. variant and stated that widespread vaccine administration was the best way to avoid \"serious consequences.\" Stephanopoulos noted that the data regarding the South Africa variant was lacking. Recent data has suggested that the South Africa strain is more resistant to current vaccines. \"We do know that it evades the protection from some of the monoclonal antibodies and it diminishes somewhat the capability and the effectiveness of the vaccine to block it. It doesn't eliminate it but it diminishes it by multiple fold. There's still some cushion left so that the vaccine does provide some protection against it,\" Fauci said. View the discussion thread.

Ten years ago, it was found that blacks are five times more likely to default on student loans than typical borrowers. Since that time, the horrible, for-profit colleges that we've all been hearing about have greatly increased their marketing to the African American community (just turn on your TV for 15 minutes, and you will be compelled to agree). These colleges, cumulatively, have a lifetime default rate of something like 60 percent, so it is safe to assume that the default rate for African Americans attending these colleges is higher, even, than this. Remember: There are no bankruptcy protections for the vast majority of student borrowers. There are also no statutes of limitations for the debt. A penalty and fee structure that can increase the debt by many multiples, and a collection regime that has powers that would make a mobster envious (Sen. Elizabeth Warren's words, not mine) combine to make a borrower with defaulted student loans stuck in what is often a lifelong trap, stuck in a marginalized state with greatly diminished prospects, and no recourse.

The release of stolen materials also impaired the DNC’s ability to support Democratic candidates in the general election,” the suit reads. “While no suit can ever fully redress the harm that the illegal conduct exacted, the DNC brings this lawsuit to seek the full measure of relied under the laws of the United States.\" The Washington Post first reported on the DNC's lawsuit, which seeks millions of dollars in damages. The Trump campaign on Friday blasted the lawsuit, calling it a \"desperate\" attempt by Democrats to curry favor with their donors after losing funding. “This is a sham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional, and nearly insolvent Democratic Party,” Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, said in a statement. “With the Democrats’ conspiracy theories against the President’s campaign evaporating as quickly as the failing DNC’s fundraising, they’ve sunk to a new low to raise money, especially among small donors who have abandoned them,\" he added, while promising to aggressively work to uncover examples of DNC corruption if the lawsuit is not immediately dismissed. The lawsuit names several Trump campaign aides as defendants who met with Russian nationals during the campaign, including Trump campaign chairman Paul ManafortPaul John ManafortDOJ investigating one-time Trump campaign adviser over alleged ties to Qatar: report Foreign lobbyists donated over M during 2020 election: report Former Mueller prosecutor representing Donoghue in congressional probes: report MORE and Trump campaign adviser Richard Gates, both of whom have since been charged in special counsel Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerSenate Democrats urge Garland not to fight court order to release Trump obstruction memo Why a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel MORE’s investigation into Russian meddling.

The lawsuit lists 12 laws that the accused parties allegedly violated, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the Wiretap Act, the Stored Communications Act, as well as D.C.'s 'Trespass' law. Suing a foreign government may pose a challenge for the campaign organization because most other countries are immune from U.S. lawsuits. The organization, however, argues that Russia cannot be protected by sovereign immunity in this case because the Kremlin trespassed “on to the DNC’s private servers ...in order to steal trade secrets and commit economic espionage.” Throughout the lengthy 66 page suit, the DNC lays out a series of events, news reports and public comments that it argues is proof of the conspiracy, like Trump Jr.’s secret communication with WikiLeaks as well as Trump's public praise of the group. The suit comes months after Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian groups for carrying out “information warfare” as well as other sophisticated measures to sow discord during the 2016 presidential election.The special counsel has yet to charge anyone for the DNC hacking, though it is reportedly under investigation. Trump has repeatedly denied that there was any collusion or coordination with Moscow, calling the federal probe a “hoax” and a “witch hunt.” - This story was updated at 5:15 p.m. View the discussion thread.

Will, who has lifted American journalism on the pages of The Washington Post with countless columns championing principled conservatism, is now the most important opinion writer in America. Will, who honorably follows in the footsteps of the greatest conservative columnist of them all, the late William F. Buckley, is now immersed in the greatest battle of his distinguished career. He is battling to save America and conservatism from the twin dangers of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. History will be kind to the long and growing list of conservatives, Republicans and former Republicans who have had the courage and clarity to aggressively confront the attack against America by Russian dictator Putin, and President TrumpDonald TrumpHouse Democrats eye 26.5 percent corporate tax rate Iran accepts deal on nuclear monitoring, avoids censure Old South vs. the new America: What Confederate monuments say about us MORE, who is ominously uninterested in confronting Putin’s attack against American and European democracy. I have praised Will before and also praised others who join him in this patriotic endeavor, including MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, Pete Wehner, Max Boot, Steve Schmidt and others. It is time to confront the false claim, repeated ad nauseam by Trump, that it has been proven that there has been no collusion, a matter which remains under intense investigation by federal authorities. The infamous Trump Tower meeting that involved Russians acting in furtherance of the attack against America and three key Trump associates, who were invited to attend the meeting to obtain negative information against Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe risks of running as Trump-lite If another 9/11 happened in a divided 2021, could national unity be achieved again? Schumer remembers 9/11: 'Oh my God, this is World War III' MORE, was a proven meeting of collusion. There is high probability that indictments will be sought as a result of this meeting, involving a conspiracy plotted by Russia to fix the election in favor of Trump. Exactly who may be indicted will depend on the degree of admissible evidence, especially involving the intent of Americans who attended, including Paul ManafortPaul John ManafortDOJ investigating one-time Trump campaign adviser over alleged ties to Qatar: report Foreign lobbyists donated over M during 2020 election: report Former Mueller prosecutor representing Donoghue in congressional probes: report MORE, Donald Trump Jr.Don TrumpHow Trump uses fundraising emails to remain undisputed leader of the GOP Donald Trump Jr. joins Cameo Book claims Trump family members were 'inappropriately' close with Secret Service agents MORE and Jared KushnerJared Corey KushnerHouse panel tees up Trump executive privilege fight in Jan. 6 probe The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - US prepares vaccine booster plan House panel probing Jan. 6 attack seeks Trump records MORE. The nation will soon be rocked by the Manafort trials. The first is currently scheduled to begin next week and does not include collusion or conspiracy with Russia involving the 2016 election. I predict that Manafort or Trump’s fixer, Michael Cohen, or both, will ultimately reach a plea deal with federal authorities. This would shake the tectonic plates of American politics by powerfully shaping American opinion and decisively offering crucial new evidence that is not yet public but may well be known by special counsel Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerSenate Democrats urge Garland not to fight court order to release Trump obstruction memo Why a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel MORE. In George Will’s latest column, the conservative columnist charged collusion between Trump and Putin: “We shall learn from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation whether in 2016 there was collusion with Russia by members of the Trump campaign. The world, however, saw in Helsinki something more grave — ongoing collusion between Trump, now in power, and Russia. The collusion is in what Trump says (refusing to back the United States’ intelligence agencies) and in what evidently went unsaid (such as: You ought to stop disrupting Ukraine, downing civilian airliners, attempting to assassinate people abroad using poisons, and so on, and on).” Truer words have rarely been written. The legal implications will ultimately be decided by Mueller and any judges or juries that may consider this subject. The central truth about the real life existence of collusion, perfectly defined by George Will, falsely denied by Trump, are clear as a bell. For Trump to conduct a secret meeting with Putin in Helsinki, with no Americans present except the American translator, was an unconscionable breach of trust and common sense. It raises profoundly ominous questions about why Trump refused to permit any senior American to attend this meeting, what may have been discussed in this meeting and whether any secret deals may have been reached that were kept secret from the secretary of State, secretary of Defense, national security adviser and White House chief of staff. In my column Thursday in The Hill, I joined others who have called for the translator to be questioned by Congress. I would add, as pure speculation, there is some chance that this secret meeting was recorded by an intelligence service that is friendly to American democracy and hostile to the Russian attack against us. The clarity, courage and conscience of George Will’s writing on these subjects is a historic contribution to American journalism, a profound contribution to American democracy and a powerful contribution to the cause of principled conservatism. Will is trying to defend America from Putin, and to save conservatism from Trump, and for that, patriotic Americans and principled conservatives should be eternally grateful.

Listen to Donald Trump MORE are slowing the release of a report warning that most Americans are exposed to enough formaldehyde on a regular basis to increase risks of cancer. One current and one former EPA official told Politico that Pruitt's appointees are stonewalling the report's release \"every step of the way\" over concerns that the report's release would have a negative impact on businesses that use the chemical. “EPA continues to discuss this assessment with our agency program partners and have no further updates to provide at this time,\" EPA spokeswoman Kelsi Daniell told Politico. “Assessments of this type are often the result of needs for particular rulemakings and undergo an extensive intra-agency and interagency process.” Pruitt's appointees are reportedly blocking the report from being reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences, an independent panel of top scientists who have already been paid $500,000 to complete the review of the report. The EPA has yet to transfer the report to the scientists to begin the review. “If the administration was really keen on protecting public health, why wouldn’t they send this to the National Academy and give it a really good review?” a former EPA official asked Politico, adding that there was only one reason to avoid submitting the report to the review panel: “You don’t want the answer.” Pruitt told a Senate panel in January that the report was completed, meaning it is now almost five months since the EPA has taken any public action on the review, according to Politico. Internal documents obtained by Politico show lobbying from the American Chemistry Council (ACC) urging the EPA to avoid releasing the report \"prematurely.\" “As stated in our meeting, a premature release of a draft assessment … will cause irreparable harm to the companies represented by the Panel and to the many companies and jobs that depend on the broad use of the chemical,” wrote the ACC's Kimberly Wise White. Following the publication of Politico's report, the ACC issued a statement denying the connection between formaldehyde exposure and developing leukemia. “The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence clearly demonstrates formaldehyde does not cause leukemia. The science shows the draft IRIS document is just plain wrong – closer to science fiction than sound science,\" the statement said. Previous research has linked exposure to the chemical to an increased chance of developing leukemia. Democrats and other critics of the Trump administration's management of the EPA urged the EPA to \"move past politics\" in statements to Politico regarding the report's burying. \"Because formaldehyde can be found in everything from wood products to women’s hair straighteners, the public health risks are substantial,” Massachusetts Sen.

The justices will determine whether the family’s civil suit against Border Patrol agent Jesus Mesa will be allowed to proceed. The family is seeking monetary damages. When the court ruled on the case in 2017, the justices did not determine whether Hernandez’s family could sue for a violation of the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unjustified deadly force. The justices threw out a ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that barred the family from suing and asked the appeals court to reconsider. The 5th Circuit ruled again last year against the child’s family, prompting them to seek the Supreme Court's intervention. Conservative Supreme Court justices have generally ruled against expanding the scope of civil rights protections. The court's ruling in this case will likely affect another cross-border shooting, where Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz fatally shot Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, a 16-year-old Mexican citizen. That case is also pending. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to not take up Hernandez and Rodriguez’s cases. Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote in an analysis of the cases that \"imposing a damages remedy on aliens injured abroad would implicate foreign-policy considerations that are committed to the political branches,\" and would interfere with the White House's ability to oversee national security, and \"risk undermining the government's ability to speak with one voice in international affairs.\" --Updated at 11:56 a.m. View the discussion thread.

MORE allies with his rash of recent comments about the would-be presidential candidate and her potential campaign. The staunch Clinton supporters feel as though Axelrod, who is promoting his new book Believer: My Forty Years in Politics, has taken unnecessary aim at Clinton and her team. “It's not helpful, and it's definitely not appreciated,” said one Clinton ally. “The last thing we need is another round of headlines about lingering tension, and this is doing exactly that. “When he speaks, it gets picked up, and people listen,” the ally added. Another supporter added: “I think a lot of us are scratching our heads. Why is any of that necessary?” A third added, \"She's been a great team player, she's been very supportive of the president and she hasn't gotten in front of him on a lot of issues so what's he trying to do?\" Axelrod did not respond to a request for comment. It hasn’t just been one or two comments or a rare, accidental slip up, Clinton insiders point out. It seems as though Axelrod is going out of his way to make a point. On MSNBC's “Hardball” earlier this week, Axelrod said John Podesta, who is expected to be Clinton’s campaign chairman in the coming months, “has to get control of the Clinton operation.” In a radio podcast with Politico’s Glenn Thrush, he said Clinton's paid six-figure speeches may have hurt her chances in 2016 and that he would have advised her to take a different approach. Even his book reveals what Axelrod wrote to Obama in a memo about Clinton before the two went head-to-head in the grueling 2008 Democratic primary. “…For all her advantages, she is not a healing figure,” Axelrod wrote in a 12-page strategic memo to Obama in late 2006, “The more she tries to moderate her image, the more she … compounds her exposure as an opportunist.” It’s not as though Axelrod is a stranger to Clinton. The two have known each other for well over a decade. She had spoken at Axelrod’s first annual fundraising dinner for CURE, the epilepsy charity he launched with his wife, Susan. Clinton also thanked Axelrod in the acknowledgements of her tome Living History. But tensions between the two rose during the 2008 Democratic primary. And after the primary came to an end and Obama suggested Clinton for secretary of State job, it was Axelrod who wondered aloud, “How can this work?” according to the book HRC, State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton. “We just had this very vigorous campaign.” Cal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University, said Axelrod’s recent comments are simply part of an effort to “peddle books.” But at the same time, Jillson questioned why the opinions have to be voiced publicly for all to witness. “Why would you be undercutting your party’s next candidate?” he asked. “If you have something to say, call up people like Podesta and tell him what you think.” “You don’t want this out there if you can avoid it,” Jillson added. But the criticism of Clintonland didn't just start recently. In December, he said he thought Clinton lacked a campaign message. “What happened in 2008 was that Hillary's candidacy got out in front of any rationale for it and the danger is that it's happening again. You hear 'Ready for Hillary; it's like 'Ready for what?” He said on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Over the summer, Axelrod hit back at Clinton, after the former secretary of State criticized Obama's foreign policy. “Just to clarify, ‘Don't do stupid stuff’ means stuff like occupying Iraq in the first place, which was a tragically bad decision,” Axelrod wrote on Twitter. Democratic strategist Chris Lehane, said it’s obvious that Axelrod isn’t using White House talking points while promoting his book. Lehane pointed to the differing views Axelrod had when discussing Obama’s views on gay marriage in the book and in subsequent media interviews. After Axelrod wrote in his book that Obama reluctantly followed his advice to not support gay marriage for fear of angering African American religious leaders, Obama claimed in an interview with BuzzFeed that, “the notion that somehow I was always in favor of marriage per se isn’t quite accurate.” He went on to say that his former adviser was “mixing up my personal feelings with my position on the issue. As for the digs on Clinton, Lehane said it’s all irrelevant and won’t have any effect on a campaign. “At the end of the day, it’s like the conversation that takes place before the Super Bowl,” Lehane said. “It’s fun to talk about, it eats up inches but once kickoff begins, it’s all moot.” If Axelrod frustrated Clinton allies with his recent comments though, he also might have helped to ease the ongoing chatter that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a darling with progressives, could beat Clinton in a primary. “I have high regard for Elizabeth. I don’t think she would beat her,” Axelrod said in an interview with Hugh Hewitt, the prominent conservative radio talk show host. “Look, look at the polling … Hillary is probably as well-positioned within her own party as any open seat candidate has been in our lifetime.” View the discussion thread.

A survey by the conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports published Friday found that 60 percent of likely voters believe the country is at war, compared with 24 percent who say the U.S. is not at war. “President Obama, Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonSchumer remembers 9/11: 'Oh my God, this is World War III' Bidens, former presidents mark 9/11 anniversary Why is Biden hesitating to challenge China as East Asia's major trade partner? MORE and other senior Democrats refuse to say America is at war with ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ for fear of insulting all Muslims, but voters beg to disagree,” the polling agency said. Majorities from both major parties said the U.S. is engaged in a conflict with radical Islam: 56 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans, as well as 54 percent of independents. Ninety-two percent of respondents also said they regard radical Islamic terrorism as a “serious” threat to national security, including 73 percent who said the threat is a “very serious” one, which is up from 50 percent in October of last year. American attitudes toward the Islamic faith as a whole also appear to have shifted. Although a plurality of Americans, 46 percent, still said terrorist groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) do not represent the true Muslim faith, that number is down from 58 percent in February. Thirty-five percent said ISIS does represent the Muslim faith.ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Paris attack last week in which at least 130 people were killed and hundreds were injured. The Rasmussen poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters Nov. 17–18. The margin of error for the poll is 3 percentage points. View the discussion thread.

It also directs local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration laws alongside their regular duties. Police departments in Texas have been largely against the bill. The police chiefs of Houston and Dallas published an op-ed in the Dallas Morning News last week calling it a “burden” on local law enforcement agencies.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled unanimously that states must adhere to the Constitution's ban on excessive fines, a decision that will likely limit the ability of states to impose certain fees and seize property. In delivering the opinion of the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the Eighth Amendment guards against abuses of the government’s punitive or criminal law-enforcement authority, and that it extends to fines. “This safeguard, we hold, is ‘fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,’ with ‘deep roots in our history and tradition,’” she said, quoting Supreme Court precedent. Ginsburg, who returned to the bench for oral arguments Tuesday for the first time since undergoing surgery in December, was joined in the ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch and Brett KavanaughBrett Michael KavanaughWhat the Texas abortion law means for Roe v. Wade The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by AT&T - Supreme Court lets Texas abortion law stand Goldman Sachs: 750K households face eviction this year MORE. Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. The case centered on Tyson Timbs, who pleaded guilty in Indiana state court to dealing in a controlled substance and conspiracy to commit theft. When Timbs was arrested, police seized the Land Rover he had purchased, for $42,000, from an insurance policy he received when his father died. The state then brought a civil forfeiture suit against Timbs for his vehicle because it had been used to transport heroin. The trial court denied the state’s forfeiture request. Since Timbs had recently purchased the vehicle for more than four times the maximum $10,000 monetary fine he can be charged for the drug conviction, the court said the forfeiture violated the Eighth Amendment. The Indiana Supreme Court ultimately reversed that ruling, holding that the Excessive Fines Clause constrains only federal action and is inapplicable to state impositions. The high court vacated that ruling Wednesday. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday to allow targets of racist 911 calls to sue their accusers. The Caution Against Racial and Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act, also known as the CAREN Act, comes amid heated racial tensions nationwide, included multiple instances of white people calling the police on African Americans who aren't breaking any laws or posing a threat. “911 calls are not customer service for people’s racism,” Supervisor Shamann Walton, who introduced the legislation and is Black, said on Twitter. Today the Board of Supervisors unanimously passed the Caution Against Racial and Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act, aka CAREN Act, on first reading (1 more reading next week), 911 calls, are not customer service for people’s racism.  Under the legislation, a person can sue a 911 caller if the call made the person feel harassed, damaged their reputation or business prospects or forced them from an area where they had the right to be. Aside from racial discrimination, a person could also be targeted due to their sex, age, religion, disability, gender identity, weight or height. The board has to vote on the measure again before Mayor London Breed (D) can sign it, according to CNN. Multiple instances of white people calling 911 on people of color have gone viral this year, with the name “Karen” now used to describe white women who use police to target members of other races. These instances come amid protests against systemic racism and police brutality inflamed by the police killings of Black Americans including George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks. In June, a video went viral of San Francisco woman Lisa Alexander confronting a Filipino man over stenciling “Black Lives Matter” in chalk on his own property. She could be heard promising to call the police over the incident. In July, Amy Cooper was charged with falsely reporting an incident after viral May footage of her calling 911 on an African American man in Central Park in Manhattan and falsely claiming that he was threatening her. Prosecutors said earlier this month that she had made a second call falsely accusing the man of assault. Objections have arisen over the CAREN Act's name. Vic Vicari wrote to the Board of Supervisors that the name “has a significant negative impact on too many good women with this name.” \"I do not have objection to this act; the issue it is trying to address is wrong. I do strongly object to the name,” Vicari wrote. “The insensitive choice of many people to use the name Karen as a general purpose term of disapproval for middle age white women needs to stop. It has a significant negative impact on too many good women with this name.” A similar bill has been introduced in the California General Assembly intended to make people think twice before calling 911 on people of color. A.B. 1150 would make it a misdemeanor to make false reports to the police and allow those who had been subject to racially motivated 911 calls to sue for damages. Oregon and New York have enacted similar laws. View the discussion thread.

MORE has a more than 2-to-1 lead over the next closest contender in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, according to a poll released Monday by Monmouth University.Trump takes 26 percent support, followed by Jeb Bush at 12 percent.ADVERTISEMENTTrump’s support has doubled in the poll since mid-July, when he had at 13 percent support and trailing Bush, who was in the lead at 15 percent.It’s the latest survey to show the businessman and reality TV star pulling away from the pack of Republican presidential candidates nationally. Trump now holds a 7.5-percentage-point lead over his next closest competitor in the field, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. That lead will increase once the Monmouth survey is factored in.The Monmouth poll found Trump pulling support from all factions of the party.Trump has a 20-point lead over Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker among Tea Party supporters, and leads him by 11 points among those who identify as “very conservative.” Trump has an 8-point lead over Bush, a former Florida governor, among those who identify as “somewhat conservative,” and also leads Bush by 8 points among those who describe themselves as moderates.Trump leads in every age category, and is the top choice of men and women in the survey. His favorability rating has improved dramatically with 52 percent saying they have a positive view of Trump, against 35 percent who view him negatively. Before Trump launched his presidential bid in June, only 20 percent had a positive view of him, compared to 55 percent who viewed him negatively.“Republican support for Donald Trump just continues to grow with no clear sense of who his constituency really is,” said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. “This makes it very difficult for his opponents to figure out how to take him on in the upcoming debate.” Walker is in third place in the poll at 11 percent support, followed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 6 percent each. Rounding out the top 10 are Ben Carson at 5 percent, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) at 4 percent a piece, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 3 percent.Fox News is capping Thursday’s first presidential debate at 10 based on national polling numbers, and it appears increasingly likely that Christie and Kasich will nab the final two spots on the debate stage.If that happens, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is likely to be unlucky number 11. He is tied for 11th place in the Monmouth poll with Carly Fiorina at 2 percent support.Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore all took 1 percent support or less in the poll, and will likely be left off the primetime debate stage as well.Fox News is holding a forum earlier on Thursday for those who don’t make the cut for the main event.The survey found a plurality of Republican voters aren’t happy with the first debate format.Forty-five percent said there should be back-to-back debates with the field split randomly between the two, while 29 percent said all of the candidates should be on stage at the same time. Only 23 percent said the debate should be limited to a top 10 based on national polling numbers.According to the Monmouth analysis, only Trump, Bush, Walker, Cruz and Huckabee are in a defined top tier of candidates, while the candidates in sixth place to 15th place are within the margin of error of the top 10.“I suppose Fox hoped that a top tier would emerge by the time the first debate rolled around,” said Murray. “But based on current polling, there’s no good rationale for arbitrarily selecting a top 10.” The Monmouth University poll of 423 registered Republican voters was conducted between July 30 and Aug. 2 and has a 4.8-percentage-point margin of error.

MORE appears likely to win reelection next year, according to three different economic models Moody’s Analytics uses to measure presidential contests. Moody’s modeling, which has only missed on one presidential election since 1980, found that Trump, who won by a 304-227 margin in the Electoral College in 2016, could easily surpass those results in 2020. The three different models showed Trump winning either 289, 332 or 351 votes in the Electoral College over his eventual opponent. The projections are based on how consumers feel about their financial situations, stock market gains achieved under Trump and the prospects for unemployment. “If the economy a year from now is the same as it is today, or roughly so, then the power of incumbency is strong and Trump’s election odds are very good, particularly if Democrats aren’t enthusiastic and don’t get out to vote,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics and co-author of the paper, told CNBC. “It’s about turnout.” Of the three models, Trump performs best under the “pocketbook” measure, which gauges how people feel about their finances. “Our ‘pocketbook’ model is the most economically driven of the three. If voters were to vote primarily on the basis of their pocketbooks, the president would steamroll the competition,” the report said. “This shows the importance that prevailing economic sentiment at the household level could hold in the next election.” The report shows that high turnout would favor the Democrats and projects a narrow Democratic victory if there is historic Democratic turnout. The report is likely to be welcome news to Trump’s campaign, which has sought to leverage on a strong economy to try to offset an array of other issues, including the House’s growing impeachment investigation. “Impeached for what, having created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country, building our strongest ever Military, Cutting Taxes too much?” Trump tweeted last week. Impeached for what, having created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country, building our strongest ever Military, Cutting Taxes too much?  To help bolster its chances, the Trump campaign has also emerged as a fundraising juggernaut, announcing Tuesday that its joint fundraising committees and the Republican National Committee hauled in a combined total of $125.7 million in the year’s third quarter.

All Rights Reserved The House passed its 2018 budget resolution Thursday in a party-line vote that represents a step toward its goal of sending tax-reform legislation to President Trump. In a 219-206 vote, lawmakers approved a budget resolution for 2018 that sets up a process for shielding the GOP tax bill from a filibuster in the Senate. A total of 18 Republicans voted against the resolution, along with all the Democrats who were present. GOP lawmakers hailed the vote as meaningful because of the tax measure. “We haven’t reformed this tax system since 1986. We need to pass this budget so we can help bring more jobs, fairer taxes and bigger paychecks for people across this country,” Speaker Paul RyanPaul Davis RyanPaul Ryan says it's 'really clear' Biden won election: 'It was not rigged.

Democrats lambasted it for the same reason. “This budget isn’t about conservative policy or reducing the size of our debt and deficits. It’s not even about American families.

Capitol Police warning of potential for violence during rally backing rioters: report MORE (R-Ky.) can only afford two defections. Republicans used the same strategy for ObamaCare repeal but failed, and are hoping for a better outcome on taxes. Yet there are already signs of trouble, with some Republicans questioning whether the tax proposal would add too much to the deficit, and others balking at plans to eliminate a deduction for state and local taxes. The tax plan is now estimated to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, but that figure would grow if the state and local tax deduction is not eliminated. Republicans have yet to secure a major legislative win despite having unified control of government. They hope to secure a tax win by the end of the year, which is an ambitious timeline. The GOP tax reform framework unveiled last week would cut the top tax rate for the wealthy and lower taxes for businesses. The proposal would consolidate the current seven individual tax brackets into three, with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. Committees may choose to establish a fourth rate above 35 percent for the wealthiest Americans. The current top individual rate is 39.6 percent. House Republicans are far behind schedule in passing the budget, which is normally approved in the spring. Thursday’s vote comes five days into the new fiscal year, and a month after the House passed all 12 of its spending bills for 2018. The government is operating under a temporary spending measure that runs out on December 8. Congress and Trump must strike a new deal to prevent a shutdown after that deadline. The House budget is in many ways an opening bid in that battle. Like the already-passed spending bills, it would increase defense spending by $72 billion, and cut nondefense spending by $5 billion. The Senate’s plan keeps overall funding levels steady. It also includes plans for trillions of dollars in spending cuts over a decade, including from programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, but does include enforcement mechanisms to enact those plans. The budget outline, for example, assumes the adoption of a House-passed ObamaCare repeal bill that has not advanced. The House budget leaves no room for tax reform to add to the deficit. Instead, it provides instructions for $203 billion in spending cuts from welfare programs in areas such as nutritional assistance and education. To unlock the reconciliation rules for tax reform, lawmakers will likely have to go to conference to sort out differences with the Senate’s budget resolution. The upper chamber’s version is being marked up in committee Thursday and is expected to move to the Senate floor in two weeks. The Senate budget carves out $1.5 trillion in possible tax cuts for the reform effort, a figure the House is expected to agree to.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The National Security Agency and FBI violated specific civil liberty protections during the Obama administration by improperly searching and disseminating raw intelligence on Americans or failing to promptly delete unauthorized intercepts, according to newly declassified memos that provide some of the richest detail to date on the spy agencies’ ability to obey their own rules. The memos reviewed by The Hill were publicly released on July 11 through Freedom of Information Act litigation by the American Civil Liberties Union. They detail specific violations that the NSA or FBI disclosed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Justice Department's national security division during President Obama’s tenure between 2009 and 2016. The intelligence community isn't due to report on compliance issues for 2017, the first year under the Trump administration, until next spring. The NSA says that the missteps amount to a small number — less than 1 percent — when compared to the hundreds of thousands of specific phone numbers and email addresses the agencies intercepted through the so-called Section 702 warrantless spying program created by Congress in late 2008. “Quite simply, a compliance program that never finds an incident is not a robust compliance program,” said Michael Halbig, the NSA’s chief spokesman. “The National Security Agency has in place a strong compliance program that identifies incidents, reports them to external overseers, and then develops appropriate solutions to remedy any incidents.” But critics say the memos undercut the intelligence community’s claim that it has robust protections for Americans incidentally intercepted under the program. “Americans should be alarmed that the NSA is vacuuming up their emails and phone calls without a warrant,” said Patrick ToomeyPatrick (Pat) Joseph ToomeyBlack women look to build upon gains in coming elections Watch live: GOP senators present new infrastructure proposal Sasse rebuked by Nebraska Republican Party over impeachment vote MORE, an ACLU staff attorney in New York who helped pursue the FOIA litigation. “The NSA claims it has rules to protect our privacy, but it turns out those rules are weak, full of loopholes, and violated again and again.” Section 702 empowers the NSA to spy on foreign powers and to retain and use certain intercepted data that was incidentally collected on Americans under strict privacy protections. Wrongly collected information is supposed to be immediately destroyed. The Hill reviewed the new ACLU documents as well as compliance memos released by the NSA inspector general and identified more than 90 incidents where violations specifically cited an impact on Americans. Many incidents involved multiple persons, multiple violations or extended periods of time. For instance, the government admitted improperly searching the NSA’s foreign intercept data on multiple occasions, including one instance in which an analyst ran the same search query about an American “every work day” for a period between 2013 and 2014. There also were several instances in which Americans’ unmasked names were improperly shared inside the intelligence community without being redacted, a violation of the so-called minimization procedures that Obama loosened in 2011 that are supposed to protect Americans' identity from disclosure when they are intercepted without a warrant. Numerous times improperly unmasked information about Americans had to be recalled and purged after the fact, the memos stated. “CIA and FBI received unminimized data from many Section 702-tasked facilities and at times are thus required to conduct similar purges,” one report noted. “NSA issued a report which included the name of a United States person whose identity was not foreign intelligence,” said one typical incident report from 2015, which said the NSA eventually discovered the error and “recalled” the information. Likewise, the FBI disclosed three instances between December 2013 and February 2014 of “improper disseminations of U.S. persons identities.”The NSA also admitted it was slow in some cases to notify fellow intelligence agencies when it wrongly disseminated information about Americans. The law requires a notification within five days, but some took as long as 131 business days and the average was 19 days, the memos show. U.S. intelligence officials directly familiar with the violations told The Hill that the memos confirm that the intelligence agencies have routinely policed, fixed and self-disclosed to the nation's intelligence court thousands of minor procedural and more serious privacy infractions that have impacted both Americans and foreigners alike since the warrantless spying program was created by Congress in late 2008. Alexander Joel, who leads the Office of Civil Liberties, Privacy and Transparency under the director of national intelligence, said the documents chronicle episodes that have been reported to Congress and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for years in real time and are a tribute to the multiple layers of oversight inside the intelligence community. “We take every compliance incident very seriously and continually strive to improve compliance through our oversight regime and as evidence by our reporting requirements to the FISC and Congress,” he told The Hill. “That said, we believe that, particularly when compared with the overall level of activity, the compliance incident rate is very low.” \"The FBI’s mission is to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States,\" the bureau said in a statement to The Hill. \"When Congress enacted Section 702, it built in comprehensive oversight and compliance procedures that involve all three branches of government. These procedures are robust and effective in identifying compliance incidents. The documents released on July 11, 2017 clearly show the FBI’s extensive efforts to follow the law, and to identify, report, and remedy compliance matters. \"Section 702 is vital to the safety and security of the American people. It is one of the most valuable tools the Intelligence Community has, and therefore, is used with the utmost care by the men and women of the FBI so as to not jeopardize future utility. As such, we continually evaluate our internal policies and procedures to further reduce the number of these compliance matters.\" The new documents show that the NSA has, on occasion, exempted itself from its legal obligation to destroy all domestic communications that were improperly intercepted. Under the law, the NSA is supposed to destroy any intercept if it determines the data was domestically gathered, meaning someone was intercepted on U.S. soil without a warrant when the agency thought they were still overseas. The NSA, however, has said previously it created “destruction waivers” to keep such intercepts in certain cases. The new documents confirm the NSA has in fact issued such waivers and that it uncovered in 2012 a significant violation in which the waivers were improperly used and the infraction was slow to be reported to the court. “In light of related filings being presented to the Court at the same time this incident was discovered and the significance of the incident, DOJ should have reported this incident under the our immediate notification process,” then-Assistant Attorney General Lisa Monaco wrote the FISA court in Aug. 28, 2012, about the episode, according to one memo released through FOIA. The NSA declined to say how often destruction waivers are given. But Joel, of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has supervised such waivers and affirmed they are “consistent with the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and the statutory requirements of Section 702.” Other violations cited in the memos: In annual and quarterly compliance reports that have been released in recent years, U.S. intelligence agencies have estimated the number of Section 702 violations has averaged between 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent of the total number of “taskings.” A tasking is an intelligence term that reflects a request to intercept a specific phone number or email address. The NSA now targets more than 100,000 individuals a year under Section 702 for foreign spying, and some individual targets get multiple taskings, officials said. “The actual number of compliance incidents remains classified but from the publicly available data it is irrefutable that the number is in the thousands since Section 702 was fully implemented by 2009,” said a senior U.S. official with direct knowledge, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The increasing transparency on Section 702 violations is having an impact on both critics and supporters of a law that is up for renewal in Congress at the end of this year. Of concern are the instances in which Americans’ data is incidentally collected and then misused. Retired House Intelligence Committee Chairman Pete Hoekstra, a Republican who strongly supported the NSA warrantless spying program when it started under President George W. Bush, said he now fears it has now become too big and intrusive. “If I were still in Congress today, I might vote with the people today to shut the program down or curtail it,” Hoekstra, who has been tapped by Trump to be ambassador to the Netherlands, said in an interview. “One percent or less sounds great, but the truth is 1 percent of my credit card charges don’t come back wrong every month. And in my mind one percent is pretty sloppy when it can impact Americans’ privacy.” This story was updated at 10:38 a.m. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Google released a new set of community guidelines Friday that ask employees to stop discussing politics during the workday. Google said the guidelines, which prompt employees to avoid certain subjects in internal communications, help keep Google \"a safe, productive, and inclusive environment for everyone.\" “While sharing information and ideas with colleagues helps build community, disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story does not. Our primary responsibility is to do the work we’ve each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics,” one guideline states. Without outright banning topics, Google said managers are expected to address discussions that violate “those rules.” Other newly issued guidelines emphasize that employees use “respect” when communicating and try to avoid discussions that “make other Googlers feel like they don’t belong.” Another reminds employees to “treat our data with care” and not disclose confidential information in violation of the company’s data security policy. In an emailed statement, a Google spokeswoman said the guidelines “exist to support the healthy and open discussion that has always been a part of our culture.” “They help create an environment where we can come together as a community in pursuit of our shared mission and serve our users,” the spokeswoman added. Earlier this month, a fired Google engineer alleged during an interview with the Journal that the company had a culture of “bullying” employees with conservative views. Google denied the allegations that employees are fired or harassed for political reasons, adding that “lively debate is a hallmark of Google’s workplace culture” The company said the engineer who made the claims, Kevin Cernekee, was fired after he used a personal device to download tens of thousands of confidential internal documents.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Energy Secretary Steven Chu on Tuesday disavowed his 2008 comments about increasing gas prices to European levels, remarks that Republicans have pounced on in recent weeks. “I no longer share that view,” Chu said during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, adding that he wants to lower gas prices. Chu, who four years ago talked of boosting the price of gasoline to the levels of Europe, said higher gas prices could slow the economic recovery. “Right now there is real hardship that Americans are suffering at the gasoline pump. We have gone through a terrible recession and a worldwide recovery, but the recovery is fragile and so, as I’ve said, another spike in gasoline prices could put that recovery in jeopardy,” he told reporters after the hearing. “There are many, many reasons why we do not want the price of gasoline to go up, we want it to go down.” Chu’s disavowal of his earlier comments is the latest sign of concern from the Obama administration over how rising gas prices could hurt the president’s reelection chances. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday that President Obama didn’t ask Chu to walk back his comments. Carney then took aim at Republicans for harping on the remarks. “[T]here has been an attempt, a largely partisan attempt, to try to take comments like that and pretend that those are policy when in fact the policy reflects the contrary,” he said during the daily White House briefing, adding that Obama “has a very clear record of aggressively pursuing domestic oil and gas production.” Obama, in the first months of the year, had been bolstered by an improving economy and the GOP primary fight, but two polls this week showed his approval ratings dropping as the price of gas nears $4 per gallon. One poll, conducted by The Washington Post and ABC News, said 65 percent of Americans disapprove of the way President Obama is handling gas prices. The White House has moved aggressively to deflect GOP criticism over gas prices. Obama has delivered three separate energy speeches in recent weeks, and he’s scheduled to deliver a fourth in Maryland on Thursday. The president also granted eight local television interviews on energy Monday. Chu, when he was director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told The Wall Street Journal in late 2008, “Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,” and said he supported gradually increasing gasoline taxes over 15 years to coax consumers into buying more efficient cars. Chu declined Tuesday to say whether he regretted making the 2008 comments. “Let me not comment on that,” he said. Chu had previously backed off the 2008 gas-price comments during his Senate confirmation process to be Energy secretary in early 2009 and in subsequent remarks. But, amid soaring gas prices, Republicans have revived Chu’s comments to argue that the administration wants higher prices at the pump in order to win more support for its clean-energy policies. The GOP has also seized on separate comments by Chu during a vague exchange earlier this month with Rep. Alan Nunnelee (R-Miss.). Chu was touting administration efforts to boost vehicle electrification, natural gas and other steps to reduce reliance on oil when Nunnelee asked, “But is the overall goal to get our price?” Chu interrupted, “No, the overall goal is to reduce our dependency on oil, to build and strengthen our economy” with alternative sources and measures to promote efficiency. While Chu added that cutting oil reliance will help consumers, Republicans on Capitol Hill and on the presidential campaign trail have nonetheless used the comments to bolster their allegations that the administration wants higher prices. The Energy secretary has consistently pushed back against such claims, as has Obama. “Obviously, what we want to do is get gas prices as low as we can, as quickly as we can, but the most important thing in order to do that is to reduce our demand of oil,” Obama said during an interview with a local Florida television station Monday.

He added in another tweet that “the answer to the problem of taking a job that you feel underpays you is to (a) not take the job, as I suggest here, or (b) not live beyond your means. It is not to restructure the economy in line with your utopian view of what you deserve from others.” The point I am making, of course, is that you cannot dictate that a job pay you what you wish it paid you.

And by the way, I have worked multiple jobs for most of my career. I do agree with this! I also agree that employers have no obligation to concede to such demands.  Shapiro said his comments follow \"a line from Kamala Harris claiming that no one should have to work two jobs.\" During the Democratic presidential debates in June, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) argued that no one should have to work more than one job in order to pay their bills. She said during the debates that she was “meeting people working two and three jobs.” While commenting on job growth in America that President TrumpDonald TrumpHouse Democrats eye 26.5 percent corporate tax rate Iran accepts deal on nuclear monitoring, avoids censure Old South vs. the new America: What Confederate monuments say about us MORE has boasted, Harris said: “Well yeah, people in America are working.” “They're working two and three jobs,” Harris continued. “So when we talk about jobs, let's be really clear: In our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on their table.\" According to Bloomberg, the rate of people holding multiple jobs in America has remained steady around the fifth percentile for the better part of a decade, despite record low unemployment numbers last year. Although hiring gains last year surpassed those in 2017, the report found that wage gains haven't kept up with job gains and have remained moderate, prompting some workers to turn to multiple jobs.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved New York City Mayor Bill de BlasioBill de BlasioBidens, former presidents mark 9/11 anniversary Macy's to resume Thanksgiving Day Parade with masks, vaccines De Blasio announces new measures following deadly flooding in NYC MORE (D) is proposing a $1 billion cut to the New York Police Department's annual budget as calls grow across the nation for local governments to divert funding from law enforcement and put it toward other social services. De Blasio said at a press conference Monday that his office presented a budget to City Council over the weekend that would \"achieve a billion dollars in savings\" for New York police. He said that the funds will be shifted to programs impacting young people and \"communities in a way that would help address a lot of the underlying issues that we know are the cause of so many problems in our society.\" \"I am excited to say that we have a plan that can achieve real reform, that can achieve real redistribution, and at the same time ensure that we keep our city safe, and we make sure that our officers are on patrol where we need them around this city,\" de Blasio added. Calls to defund the police and put government funding toward other social services have gained traction in the weeks since the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. Mayors in San Francisco and Los Angeles have pledged to cut police budgets, while city councils in places such as Washington, D.C., have passed a slate of reform measures to enhance law enforcement oversight. In early June, de Blasio committed to cutting funding for the police and investing the money in youth and social services. He did not pledge a specific figure until this weekend. Activists, City Council members and former de Blasio staffers had been calling on the mayor to reduce the NYPD's budget by $1 billion. The department has annual budget of about $6 billion. De Blasio announced the cuts as protesters calling for the defunding of police continue a sit-in outside City Hall, according to ABC News. The mayor said that his office's proposal included $500 million intended to go towards youth centers and New York City Housing Authority developments. The money will be shifted from the police department's capital budget, de Blasio said, adding that \"the capital piece is separate from the billion.\" De Blasio's proposal also calls for moving schools safety agents, which wear police uniforms, to the Department of Education and canceling a July class of about 1,100 new recruits, Politico noted. \"Remember, we're talking about between the Executive Budget in April and this budget now, billions of dollars of cuts across all our agencies,\" de Blasio said, adding that his office is still in negotiations with City Council.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during an interview late Tuesday again referred to President Trump as \"President Bush.\" During the interview with Fox affiliate KTVU-TV in San Francisco, Pelosi criticized Trump over his position on repealing ObamaCare, but called him \"President Bush,\" who was in office from 2001 to 2009. \"Everything we have seen so far with the president has been about tax cuts for the rich,\" Pelosi said. \"In fact, affecting California very directly, is the Affordable Care Act.\" \"President Bush has come out against that, as you know, and it is not even a healthcare bill,\" she continued. \"The Republican bill is not even a healthcare bill. It's a tax bill disguised as a healthcare bill.\" The gaffe went unnoticed by Pelosi and the KTVU reporter conducting the interview. Pelosi has referred to Trump as Bush on three other occasions since January. In an interview with Jonathan Karl of ABC News on April 30, the congresswoman jokingly apologized to Bush for confusing him with Trump. “I’m so sorry President Bush,” she said to an amused Karl. “I never thought I’d pray for the day that you were president again.” Pelosi, who's 77, has represented California's 5th District in the House of Representatives since 1987.

The Freedom Caucus, which Jordan described to The Wall Street Journal as an “agile, active group” of about 40 Republicans devoted to limited-government principles, helped derail Speaker John Boehner’s GOP plan to extend funding for the Homeland Security Department for three weeks. House Republicans’ failure to pass the bill meant Boehner, an Ohio Republican like Jordan, was forced to rely on Democrats to prevent a shutdown at the agency, raising more questions about the Speaker’s political vulnerabilities. The invite-only group is seen as a rival to the much larger, more inclusive Republican Study Committee, which is closer to Boehner and his team.

All Rights Reserved A close friend of former Secretary of State Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe risks of running as Trump-lite If another 9/11 happened in a divided 2021, could national unity be achieved again? Schumer remembers 9/11: 'Oh my God, this is World War III' MORE sent her a memo initially blaming the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, on an anti-Islamic video before walking that assertion back one day later, according to a batch of Hillary Clinton's emails released by The New York Times. Clinton received about 25 memos on Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a former Clinton aide who had business dealings with the country’s transitional government. She forwarded some of those emails to her senior staff, in some cases asking them to act on the findings, without identifying him as the source. One exchange between Clinton aide Jake Sullivan and Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who later died in the Benghazi attack, referred to Blumenthal only as “HRC friend.” Blumenthal initially sent Clinton an email one day after the 2012 attacks that blamed them on “demonstrators … inspired by what many devout Libyans viewed as a sacrilegious internet video on the prophet Mohammed.” Clinton forwarded that email to Sullivan, her top foreign policy aide, calling it “more info.” He sent a new memo the next day that told the secretary that “sensitive sources” believed it was actually a terrorist attack. Clinton forwarded the second email to Sullivan, telling him, “we should get this around asap.” Blumenthal, a former journalist, served in President Clinton’s White House as a special assistant to the president and has been a longtime Clinton loyalist. While Hillary Clinton wanted to bring him onto her team at State, President Obama’s top aides blocked him because of his attacks on the future president during the 2008 campaign, according to multiple reports. Many Republican critics of the Obama administration’s handling of the Benghazi attacks have condemned the White House for initially blaming the attack on an anti-Islamic video. Clinton sought to separate herself from Blumenthal’s emails during a brief media availability on Tuesday in Iowa, where she said her close friend occasionally sent her “unsolicited emails which I passed on in some instances.” “I have many, many old friends, and I always think that it’s important when you get into politics to have friends you had before you were in politics and to understand what’s on their minds,” she said. The latest batch of emails does not contain any evidence Clinton received classified information on her private email — the highest classification of messages was “sensitive but unclassified.” In some cases, those emails contain the location of American officials inside Libya and an email where Ambassador Stevens debated leaving Benghazi due to security concerns. Clinton has faced significant scrutiny over revelations she used private email exclusively while serving as secretary. She turned over about half the emails on her private server to the State Department for review and release, and deleted the other half, which she deemed strictly personal The New York Times received about a third of the 850 emails already turned over to the House Select Committee on Benghazi by the State Department as part of its investigation. The committee has already subpoenaed a number of former Clinton aides, including Blumenthal, and Clinton is expected to testify once in front of the committee. Clinton called on the State Department to expedite the release of the emails on Tuesday while on the campaign trail in Iowa. “I want those emails out. Nobody has a bigger interest in getting them released than I do,” Clinton said, adding that the emails will help Americans learn about her time in Foggy Bottom. A federal judge ruled this week that the department could not wait until next year to release the email trove and, instead, must release emails on a rolling basis. That slow drip threatens to drag out the release over the months that Clinton is campaigning for president. View the discussion thread.

Kentucky hospitals reaching 'critical point': governor MORE’s (R-Ky.) opposition to Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch on Thursday. Paul said he opposed confirming Lynch because she supports civil forfeitures, a controversial law enforcement tactic, but the chairman of the CBC dismissed those concerns. “Senator Paul is using the issue of civil forfeitures to block a well-qualified federal prosecutor from heading the Department of Justice,” said CBC Chairman G.K.

On Wednesday, Paul said that he was opposing Lynch because she had said during her confirmation hearing that asset forfeiture laws are a “wonderful tool.” Under the laws, police departments and other law enforcement agencies can keep the proceeds of properties they seize during investigations — even when they never charge the owner with a crime. Law enforcement agencies say that it helps them stop the proceeds of crime from being returned to criminal syndicates. Paul has proposed legislation that would strip the attorney general of the authority to run those programs at the federal level. In his statement announcing his opposition to Lynch’s nomination on Wednesday, Paul said that he considered the laws “ to be an infringement on the Fifth Amendment.” He also cited Lynch's support for President Obama’s executive action on immigration and what he called her “non-committal” stance on the legality of drone use when explaining his opposition to her confirmation Paul does not serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will vote on whether to advance Lynch’s nomination to the floor. But he has made his support for criminal justice reforms a key part of his agenda as he considers running for president in 2016 and argues that the Republican Party must better appeal to minority voters.

All Rights Reserved When President Donald TrumpDonald TrumpHouse Democrats eye 26.5 percent corporate tax rate Iran accepts deal on nuclear monitoring, avoids censure Old South vs. the new America: What Confederate monuments say about us MORE announced his nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, he fulfilled— for the second time — his campaign promise to nominate judges to the high court who will interpret the Constitution according to its original meaning. In his 12 years on a federal court of appeals, Judge Kavanaugh developed a clear, consistent record of textualism and originalism. This means that he can be relied upon to protect religious liberty and ensure that administrative agencies stay within their legal authority. Judge Kavanaugh’s respect for the Constitution and the proper role of a judge is evident from a speech last year at Notre Dame Law School in which he likened the role of a judge to that of an umpire, one who is mindful of a fair and independent process and the law as it is written, not bound by allegiance to a team. In his work as a judge,Kavanaugh has a clear record of being that umpire in his cases, ruling on the letter of the law and the Constitution, not out of loyalty to a worldview or political party. This is great news for Americans concerned about protecting religious freedom and making sure administrative agencies stay within the realm of their legal authority. While on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Judge Kavanaugh often defended religious liberty. In Priests for Life v. HHS, for example, he argued that the Health and Human Services contraception mandate, despite the “accommodation” offered by the Obama administration after it lost the Hobby Lobby case, imposed a “substantial burden” on religious organizations. Kavanaugh voted to prevent the Obama administration from forcing religious organizations to violate their conscience by providing abortion-inducing drugs to their employees. His position was later upheld when the Supreme Court vacated the D.C. Circuit’s panel decision in Zubik v. Burwell. Similarly, when atheist groups challenged the constitutionality of the presidential oath of office, in which the president swears “so help me God,” Judge Kavanaugh took a firm stand based on originalist principles. He pointed to both text and tradition in concluding, “the words ‘so help me God’ in the Presidential oath are not proselytizing or otherwise exploitative,” and therefore did not constitute an establishment of a state religion; and that “like the practice of legislative prayer, use of ‘so help me God’ in oaths for government officials is deeply rooted in the Nation's history and tradition.\" In addition to his efforts to protect the religious liberty, Judge Kavanaugh has a record of enforcing strict limits on the administrative state. His originalist and textualist principles are clear in these rulings scaling back overreach by administrative agencies. He blocked overreaching orders from several federal agencies, including the Obama-era net neutrality rule imposed by the FCC. In two separate cases, Kavanaugh’s dissents in finding certain EPA regulations exceeded their statutory limits were upheld in 5-4 opinions written by Justice Scalia. One case raising concern for some conservatives is Seven-Sky v. Holder, in which Judge Kavanaugh wrote that the courts didn’t yet have jurisdiction to hear the case. But Kavanaugh strongly criticized the government’s arguments in defense of ObamaCare, arguing it lacked a “principled limit,” created an “expansion of congressional authority,” and “a potentially significant infringement of individual liberty.” Kavanaugh has also proven himself to be a skeptic of so-called Chevron deference, which dictates that judges should defer to federal agencies’ interpretations of certain issues or questions. Kavanaugh has called Chevron deference “an atextual invention by courts...nothing more than a judicially orchestrated shift of power from Congress to the Executive Branch” and has warned against excessive judicial deference to agency interpretation. This should give conservatives confidence that if confirmed to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh will ensure that executive agencies stop usurping power that properly belongs to elected representatives. Just like Neil Gorsuch before him, it’s clear that Judge Kavanaugh will make another great justice, one who will protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. The Senate should act swiftly to confirm Kavanaugh so that he can begin protecting our constitutional rights and the separation of powers.

All Rights Reserved Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have come to a consensus decision to not have hearings or a vote on a Supreme Court nominee in 2016. The committee Republicans left McConnell’s office and walked straight into a lunch with the party conference to brief their colleagues. After the meeting, McConnell said the rest of the Senate Republican Conference backed the Judiciary Committee's unanimous position. And given their recommendation, McConnell said, he wouldn't bother to even meet with an Obama nominee. \"The overwhelming view of the Republican conference in the Senate is this vacancy should not be filled by this lame-duck president,\" he told reporters. All 11 members of the panel signed a letter to McConnell Tuesday declaring they would not hold hearings to ensure the next president, not Obama, pick someone to replace the late conservative justice, Antonin Scalia. “We wish to inform you of our intention to exercise our constitutional authority to withhold consent on any nominee to the Supreme Court submitted by this president to fill Justice Scalia’s vacancy,” they wrote. Scalia's death has triggered a battle between the White House and Republicans over filling the court vacancy. The GOP has offered mixed messages since Scalia's death about whether senators would even allow a hearing on an Obama nominee, who, if confirmed, would likely tilt the ideological balance of the court to the left. McConnell, within hours of Scalia's death, issued a statement saying that a decision on a nominee should wait until after the presidential election. McConnell, backed by other Republicans, argued this would give voters a bigger role in the decision. The White House and Democrats have argued that the Senate should consider a nominee from Obama, who is at the beginning of the fourth year of his second term. They have argued that it would be a dereliction of duty for the Senate not to consider a nomination and leave an empty seat on the court for a year or more. There have been some signs of disunity within the GOP, which faces a tough task in holding on to its Senate majority in a presidential election year. Sen.

Republicans have sought to use Vice President Biden's past words as a weapon against Democrats. Biden, in a 1992 floor speech in the Senate, argued that if there were to be a Supreme Court vacancy, it should not be filled until after that year's elections. GOP lawmakers on Tuesday cited that speech in their comments. Biden issued a statement Monday evening arguing his comments are being taken out of context.

Ryan held a call with the GOP conference Monday saying he would no longer defend Trump and that Republicans up for election should do what they need to do to win — even if that means cutting Trump loose. Trump is furious over the slight, and he and his campaign signaled they would not let the matter go. Republicans abandoned Trump in droves over the weekend after an explosive video surfaced of the nominee making obscene remarks. Some are panicking that the chaos at the top of the ticket will cost majorities in the Senate and potentially the House. Carson said that Trump should focus on winning his own race rather than feuding with GOP leaders. \"The way forward is for them to both pursue their respective goals,” Carson said. “Trump should concentrate on the issues and stop allowing himself to be dragged off into the hinterlands. … Let Paul Ryan concentrate on the House. It’s critical; you need that fail-safe mechanism.\" “He’ll realize soon enough that he shouldn’t be attacking Ryan and that his energy needs to be on the issues, because that’s how he wins,” Carson continued. “If he would concentrate on those things he would win in a walk. It’s hard for him.\" Carson acknowledged that the GOP appears to be in the throes of a divisive civil war and warned that it could doom the party on Election Day. “Basically what’s happening is our country is a train about to go off a cliff, and there’s a fight going on in one of the cars,” Carson said. “Traditionally Republicans always find a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory,” he said. “This might be the most graphic example of it, although there’s still hope.

It was not stolen' Democrats fret over Trump-district retirements ahead of midterms To cut poverty and solve the labor shortage, enhance the Earned Income Tax Credit MORE (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Budget Committee and a leading conservative lawmaker, on Monday slammed a controversial Internet piracy bill. “The Internet is one of the most magnificent expressions of freedom and free enterprise in history,” Ryan said in a news release. “It should stay that way. “While H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act, attempts to address a legitimate problem, I believe it creates the precedent and possibility for undue regulation, censorship and legal abuse.” Ryan said he would vote against the legislation should it come before the House. The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) would empower the Justice Department and copyright holders to demand that search engines, Internet providers and ad networks cut off access to sites “dedicated” to copyright infringement. The bill is aimed at blocking foreign sites such as The Pirate Bay that offer illegal copies of movies, music and television shows with impunity. The bill has divided lawmakers, but not along party lines, as there are blocs of support and opposition on both sides of the aisle. The opposition of Ryan, an influential conservative, could be significant if it spurs other Republicans to come out against the bill. A broad coalition, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Hollywood, the recording industry and organized labor strongly back the bill. They say Internet piracy is destroying businesses and killing jobs. But consumer groups and major Web companies, including Google, Yahoo and Facebook, warn that SOPA could stifle innovation and censor free speech. Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt has said the bill would “criminalize linking and the fundamental structure of the Internet,” and warned that it would create a Web-censorship regime similar to ones used in such authoritarian countries as China. SOPA’s sponsor, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas), said his bill does not apply to lawful websites, and opponents such as Google are “spreading lies.” “Chairman Ryan is usually very knowledgeable on issues before Congress, which is why it’s surprising that he appears not to have closely read the manager’s amendment to the Stop Online Piracy Act,\" Smith said in an emailed statement, referring to the most recent draft of the bill. \"Had Chairman Ryan read the manager’s amendment, he would have realized that the bill targets only foreign websites dedicated to illegal activity,\" Smith said. \"It’s not regulation to enforce the law against online criminals. And it’s not censorship to prevent online criminals from stealing the products and profits that rightly belong to American innovators.\" He claimed foreign websites are costing American businesses billions of dollars and thousands of jobs every year. \"We enforce laws against criminals in the brick and mortar world,\" Smith said. \"I am surprised that my colleague does not feel strongly about enforcing the law against criminals online as well.” Smith’s Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on the bill when Congress returns from its recess later this month. The Senate is also set to vote on its version of the legislation, the Protect IP Act, when Congress returns. This story was updated at 1:41 p.m. View the discussion thread.

He added that “no one has done more” for lasting peace. Reports over the weekend, including one from The Times of Israel, quoted anonymous Israeli sources accusing Kerry of giving into Hamas’s demands. “What was leaked, unfortunately, I think was misinformed, or an effort to misinform,” Blinken said about the reported cease-fire terms. Israel rejected a draft cease-fire proposal that was reportedly in the works on Friday as Kerry worked to negotiate a deal in Cairo, Egypt. Blinken explained the leaked proposal was not sponsored by the U.S., but instead was a “discussion paper based on... [an] original Egyptian initiative” unveiled in mid-July. Israel had agreed to that original Egyptian cease-fire proposal earlier this month but Hamas rejected the offer, leading to more violence. The United Nations Security Council late Sunday approved a resolution urging a humanitarian cease-fire, but Hamas fired rockets into Israel on Monday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly said Monday that his country is prepared for a prolonged operation to destroy Hamas-built tunnels from Gaza into Israel.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Many Republicans who are eyeing a run for president in 2016 are backing an all-or-nothing plan to defund ObamaCare. More than half a dozen possible GOP White House candidates support that strategy while a handful are calling for a more nuanced approach to defunding or repealing the healthcare law.

The effort places immense pressure on GOP leaders and could result in a government shutdown if it prevents Congress from agreeing on a continuing resolution by Sept. 30. Several top national Republicans have either been silent or agnostic on the threat, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. But the movement has gained support from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Sen. Rick Santorum (Pa.), who are pushing Congress toward a last-ditch effort to kill ObamaCare. “Shutting down ObamaCare is essential for the economy, for quality healthcare and for our freedom,” said Jindal press secretary Sean Lansing in a statement. “We are for using any and every tool to do that.” Those arguments are likely to continue as the presidential field takes shape over the next couple of years. The conservative base is vehemently opposed to the healthcare law and will stop at nothing to ensure its funding is rescinded. Some members of the expected GOP field are not voicing dramatic calls for action, however. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul RyanPaul Davis RyanPaul Ryan researched narcissistic personality disorder after Trump win: book Paul Ryan says it's 'really clear' Biden won election: 'It was not rigged. It was not stolen' Democrats fret over Trump-district retirements ahead of midterms MORE (Wis.) have expressed reservations about the shutdown threat and backed more conventional paths to ending healthcare reform, like traditional repeal. Walker, a Tea Party favorite, told The New York Times this month that he has “real concerns” about a shutdown harming the economy. Also sharing concerns are Sen. Kelly AyotteKelly Ann AyottePoll: Potential Sununu-Hassan matchup in N.H. a dead heat Democrats facing tough reelections back bipartisan infrastructure deal Sununu seen as top recruit in GOP bid to reclaim Senate MORE (R-N.H.) and Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.), who recently said he’s serious about a presidential run next cycle. In an interview, King criticized Lee and his supporters for “basically holding a gun to the head of the administration.” “I am totally opposed to ObamaCare, but the fact is, it passed both houses [of Congress] and was signed into law and the president was reelected,” King said. “I think this [strategy] is wrong governmentally, wrong philosophically and bad politically. People will see it for what it is — a shakedown tactic. “We should continue to try to repeal ObamaCare but we should do it by the proper procedure,” King said. Some politicians would not directly answer questions about a government shutdown as it relates to ObamaCare. For example, Sen. Rob PortmanRobert (Rob) Jones PortmanMajor US port target of attempted cyber attack Hillicon Valley — Presented by Xerox — Officials want action on cyberattacks Officials urge Congress to consider fining companies that fail to report cyber incidents MORE’s spokeswoman noted that the Ohio Republican is a cosponsor of Cruz’s bill to defund ObamaCare. But the statement adds, “As we approach the debate over the continuing resolution in the Senate, Sen. Portman is looking at a variety of ways to get our budget in order and rein in spending so as not to place an unfair burden on future generations.” Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s spokeswoman did not mention a shutdown threat in her statement to The Hill: “ObamaCare is a deeply flawed, unsustainable and misguided government takeover of our healthcare system that will bankrupt the states and the federal government. As we continue to see the implementation of aspects of ObamaCare delayed, it is clear this bill is not the answer to our healthcare challenges.” Meanwhile, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez’s office pointed to her State of the State address in January. At that time, Martinez stressed she didn’t support ObamaCare though added, “…it’s the law of the land. The election is over and the Supreme Court has ruled. My job is not to play party politics, but to implement this law in a way that best serves New Mexico.” The divisions within the Republican Party surrounding the shutdown threat highlight the political pressures facing the nascent GOP presidential field. They also pose a major problem for Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. Rubio endorsed Lee’s proposal after he alienated conservative voters by shepherding an immigration bill through the Senate. Cruz has emerged as a lead spokesman for the movement, adding to his visibility and strengthening his ties with conservative pressure groups, such as Heritage Action and FreedomWorks. Paul took a step back Wednesday when he said he opposes a government shutdown. “I am in favor of using our leverage to make it less bad,” he told reporters in Louisville. “I also know that we don’t control all of the government, so we fight for what we can get.” Those comments drew attention given Paul’s ties to Senate Minority Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse passes standalone bill to provide B for Israel's Iron Dome Pelosi vows to avert government shutdown McConnell calls Trump a 'fading brand' in Woodward-Costa book MORE (R-Ky.), who is facing pressure from his conservative primary opponent to support the shutdown threat. Paul has endorsed McConnell, who made headlines Tuesday when he said, “I’m for stopping ObamaCare, but shutting down the government will not stop ObamaCare.” “Most of it is permanent law and not affected by that,” McConnell told a group of healthcare workers, according to WYMT-TV. “It also wouldn’t stop the taxes. Taxes that are going in on medical devices, taxes that are going in on health insurance premiums.” The comments drew immediate fire from McConnell’s GOP challenger, Matt Bevin, and the conservative blogosphere, which interpreted them as a position against the shutdown threat. McConnell’s office clarified that he was simply making a statement of fact, not taking sides in the fight. The debate is expected to get more volatile in the coming weeks. Heritage Action is planning events in nine cities before the end of August to drum up grassroots support for the Lee plan. “There is nobody who denies this will require courage,” Heritage Action CEO Michael Needham said Wednesday on a call with reporters. “Maybe [Congress’s] approval rating is at 12 percent because they haven’t tried to inspire people.” KILL OBAMACARE FUNDING AT ANY COST (7) Sen.

All Rights Reserved In a victory for the Obama administration, the spending package released by congressional leaders on Wednesday won’t block American financial contributions to an international climate fund for poorer nations. The bill, greens and Democrats say, doesn’t explicitly appropriate funding for President Obama’s pledged contribution to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). But since the legislation doesn’t formally block money for the GCF either, Obama is expected to be able to use current discretionary funding streams to send American money to it. “Based on what we have reviewed so far, there are no restrictions on our ability to make good on the president’s pledge to contribute to the Green Climate Fund,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said on Wednesday. The GFC is a pot of public and private money designed to help poorer nations prepare for climate change. Obama pledged last year to spend $3 billion on the fund by 2020, and he asked Congress to appropriate up to $500 million for it in 2016. Republicans have opposed providing money to the fund, and a House appropriations bill blocked the funding this summer. During negotiations over an international climate deal, the GOP said it would work to block GFC money in any omnibus bill unless the Senate got a chance to vote on ratifying the climate agreement. “Congress will weigh in on whatever comes out of the Paris climate talks, and the money that the president has requested as part of his budget,” Sen.

Neither language was included in the omnibus spending bill leadership released early Wednesday morning. But that allows Obama to move funding from other spending areas to the GFC if he wants to, fund supporters say. “This is a rebuke to those congressional extremists who tried to play politics with desperately needed money to help the world’s poor take climate action,” Friends of the Earth senior analyst Karen Orenstein said in a statement Wednesday. “Morality and reason, rather than science-denying isolationism, prevailed in this case.” —This post was updated at 5:34 p.m. View the discussion thread.

The president, speaking at the daily White House briefing on the pandemic, made clear he does not support using vote-by-mail as a backstop in the event the outbreak keeps people from going to the polls. “No, because I think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting,\" said Trump, who has levied baseless accusations about voter fraud that he claims kept him from winning the popular vote in 2016. \"I think people should vote with ID, voter ID.

The coronavirus relief package signed into law last week by Trump included $400 million for states to beef up preparations for primaries and the general election during the coronavirus crisis. Democrats had initially pushed for $4 billion. Trump and other Republicans have largely rejected the idea of widespread vote-by-mail, with some arguing it would harm the electoral prospects of GOP candidates. The president on Friday said the general election will go forward as scheduled Nov. 3, even though numerous states have postponed their primaries or moved them to all-mail ballots amid the pandemic. In Wisconsin, the state is expected to go forward with its primary on Tuesday. Gov. Tony Evers (D) on Friday urged the state legislature to allow all-mail voting and accept ballots cast in the coming weeks. Trump criticized Evers while highlighting his support for a judicial candidate in Wisconsin. \"Why didn’t he do this two weeks ago?\" Trump said at the briefing. \"All of a sudden an election, which is taking place very soon, gets delayed.

Schumer remembers 9/11: 'Oh my God, this is World War III' MORE has failed to respond to a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the parents of two of the men killed during the 2012 attack on the American outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The Democratic presidential nominee was declared in default by the court clerk Friday — a designation that simply means she was served with court documents and that she did not answer the complaint. It is not a finding of liability. In fact, Clinton’s Secret Service delegation and campaign aides refused to accept the summons, according to court documents. But Clinton will now have to respond in some way — such as arguing that the default be set aside or moving to dismiss the case entirely — to avoid the possibility that a judge could rule automatically in favor of the plaintiffs. Her lawyers could also seek an extension that would push her deadline for response past the November election. Patricia Smith and Charles Woods claim in the suit that the attack that killed their sons, Sean Smith and Tyrone Woods, as well as two other Americans, “was directly and proximately caused, at a minimum” by Clinton’s use of a private email server while in office. “As a direct result of Defendant Clinton’s reckless handling of this classified, sensitive information, Islamic terrorists were able to obtain the whereabouts of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and thus the U.S. State Department and covert and other government operations in Benghazi, Libya and subsequently orchestrate, plan, and execute the now infamous September 11, 2012 attack,” according to the suit. Both parents have been outspoken against Clinton. Smith, who is a vocal supporter of GOP candidate Donald TrumpDonald TrumpHouse Democrats eye 26.5 percent corporate tax rate Iran accepts deal on nuclear monitoring, avoids censure Old South vs. the new America: What Confederate monuments say about us MORE, said during the Republican National Convention in July, “I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son.” The Republican-lead House committee investigating the attacks found no new evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton, in a report filed in June. Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton, said in a statement: “While no one can imagine the pain of the families of the brave Americans we lost at Benghazi, there have been nine different investigations into this attack and none found any evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing on the part of Hillary Clinton.” According to the conservative lawyer and longtime Clinton enemy who brought the suit, Clinton’s failure to respond is evidence that the former secretary of State “doesn’t care about our clients.\" “Most private litigants would never have something go into default and it’s tantamount to her saying, ‘What difference does this lawsuit make?’ ” said Larry Klayman, who founded the conservative watchdog groups Freedom Watch and Judicial Watch. He is no longer involved with Judicial Watch. The suit, which targets Clinton in her private capacity, seeks unspecified damages and demands a trial by jury. It is before Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, where it was filed as a case related to a separate federal records suit involving Clinton’s server that was brought by Judicial Watch. Clinton lawyers may also contest that the wrongful death suit is genuinely related and the case could in theory be reassigned. Friday’s declaration of default doesn’t carry any automatic impact — a default judgment, for example, would require a request from the plaintiffs. The court now awaits motion from either party. “This case is not going to be decided before the election, it was not brought for that purpose,” Klayman said. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Former first lady Nancy Reagan died Sunday of congestive heart failure at the age of 94, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Foundation announced. She had been living in Bel Air, Calif., and had been in failing health in recent years. Nancy Reagan married Ronald Reagan in 1952, before he left his screen acting career for politics, and served as first lady from 1981 until 1989, during his two terms in the White House. She was perhaps best known for her “Just Say No” campaign against drug abuse, but she played an active role in many of her husband’s political efforts as well. She also spoke openly about surgery she had to fight breast cancer to encourage other women to get screened for the disease. After Ronald Reagan left office and later announced that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Nancy Reagan became an advocate for increasing research into the degenerative brain disorder. In that effort she opposed limits on embryonic stem cell research backed by then-President George W. Bush. Other public figures almost immediately began to express their sadness at her death. “Nancy Reagan was totally devoted to President Reagan, and we take comfort that they will be reunited once more,” said former first lady Barbara Bush, the wife of Reagan’s vice president, George H. W. Bush. \"George and I send our prayers and condolences to her family.” Former President George W. Bush said in a statement that Nancy Reagan’s devotion to her husband was matched only by her devotion to the country. “Her influence on the White House was complete and lasting,” he said. President Obama and first lady Michelle ObamaMichelle LeVaughn Robinson ObamaBidens, former presidents mark 9/11 anniversary Breonna Taylor portrait takes center stage in new Smithsonian exhibit Jill Biden resuming in-person teaching at Virginia community college MORE wrote in a statement that they were fortunate to benefit from Nancy Reagan’s “proud example, and her warm and generous advice.” “Our former First Lady redefined the role in her time here. Later, in her long goodbye with President Reagan, she became a voice on behalf of millions of families going through the depleting, aching reality of Alzheimer’s, and took on a new role, as advocate, on behalf of treatments that hold the potential and the promise to improve and save lives,” they added.

It was not stolen' Democrats fret over Trump-district retirements ahead of midterms To cut poverty and solve the labor shortage, enhance the Earned Income Tax Credit MORE (R-Wis.) said, \"Ronald Reagan could not have accomplished everything that he did without his wife Nancy.\" News of Nancy Reagan's death also drew reactions from both Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who said \"she embodied what it means to represent America as First Lady,\" and his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.). “As we celebrate her life and legacy as a partner, confidante and adviser to President Reagan, and as a leader and philanthropist in her own right, we should also honor her passing by reflecting on the progress we can make when our elected officials work together across the aisle, as the Reagan administration did on issues ranging from immigration to nuclear arms control, making our people more prosperous and our nation more secure,\" Wasserman Schultz said in a statement.

All Rights Reserved Donald TrumpDonald TrumpCapitol Police recommend disciplinary action for six officers in Jan. 6 internal probe Biden defends Afghanistan withdrawal on 9/11 Will the US emulate China's tech takedown? MORE’s economic adviser Stephen Moore told a group of top Republicans last week that they now belong to a fundamentally different political party. Moore surprised some of the Republican lawmakers assembled at their closed-door whip meeting last Tuesday when he told them they should no longer think of themselves as belonging to the conservative party of Ronald Reagan. They now belong to Trump’s populist working-class party, he said. A source briefed on the House GOP whip meeting — which Moore attended as a guest of Majority Whip Steve Scalise — said several lawmakers told him they were taken aback by the economist’s comments. “For God’s sake, it’s Stephen Moore!” the source said, explaining some of the lawmakers’ reactions to Moore’s statement. “He’s the guy who started Club for Growth. He’s Mr. Supply Side economics.” “I think it’s going to take them a little time to process what does this all mean,” the source added of the lawmakers. “The vast majority of them were on the wrong side. They didn’t think this was going to happen.” Asked about his comments to the GOP lawmakers, Moore told The Hill he was giving them a dose of reality. “Just as Reagan converted the GOP into a conservative party, Trump has converted the GOP into a populist working-class party,” Moore said in an interview Wednesday. “In some ways this will be good for conservatives and in other ways possibly frustrating.” Moore has spent much of his career advocating for huge tax and spending cuts and free trade. He’s been as close to a purist ideological conservative as they come, but he says the experience of traveling around Rust Belt states to support Trump has altered his politics. “It turned me more into a populist,” he said, expressing frustration with the way some in the Beltway media dismissed the economic concerns of voters in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan. “Having spent the last three or four months on the campaign trail, it opens your eyes to the everyday anxieties and financial stress people are facing,” Moore added. “I’m pro-immigration and pro-trade, but we better make sure as we pursue these policies we’re not creating economic undertow in these areas.” After such a transformative experience — and after witnessing Trump’s stunning victory — Moore now believes Republican House members should be less ideologically pure and instead help Trump give the voters what he promised them. “He wants to spend all this money on infrastructure,” Moore said, referring to Trump’s potentially trillion-dollar infrastructure package. It’s a massive spending bill that naturally appeals far more to Democrats than Republicans. Moore, who has worked for the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation, is not a fan of the stimulus package, but he is prepared to support it. “I don’t want to spend all that money on infrastructure,” Moore said. “I think it’s mostly a waste of money. But if the voters want it, they should get it.” “If Trump says build a wall then he should build a wall. If Trump says renegotiate TPP [the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal], he should renegotiate TPP.” “Elections have consequences,” Moore added, “and I do think Donald Trump has a mandate.” Moore says his “view on trade has adjusted a bit” over the course of the 2016 campaign. “I used to be unilateral free trader,” he said. “If somebody wants to sell something to us at less cost than we can produce here, then do it.\" “But the political reality,” he added, “is there’s a backlash against trade. Whether we like it or not we better adapt the rules in ways that benefit American workers more, or free trade is not going to flourish. “We can scream and whine all we want but that’s reality.” Moore is excited about large parts of Trump’s agenda. He helped write Trump’s tax plan and thinks the cuts will accelerate economic growth and create new jobs. He’s also had a hand in Trump’s energy plan and looks forward to slashing regulations hindering American energy production. But Moore knows the days of Reaganite conservatism are probably over. “Reagan ran as an ideological conservative. Trump ran as an economic populist,” he said. “Trump’s victory,” Moore added, “turned it into the Trump party.” View the discussion thread.

The decisions underscore the growing concern about a widespread outbreak on Capitol Hill, which got its first confirmed case on Wednesday night. “In response to reports that an aide from another Senate office has tested positive for COVID-19, Sen. Cruz has temporarily closed the D.C. office out of an abundance of caution to protect the health and welfare of staff, constituents, and colleagues in Congress,” Cruz’s office said in a statement. Cruz is currently quarantined after being exposed to an individual with the virus; the rest of his staff will work remotely. The senator's office says he is healthy, and his self-quarantine is scheduled to end Thursday night. Cotton added in a statement that he was closing his office \"effectively immediately.\" \"An aide in another Senate office has tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus; other congressional employees are likely to test positive in the days ahead. The most sensible course of action for the public and the congressional workforce under the circumstances is for my staff to telecommute,\" Cotton added. Cotton said his Washington, D.C., office will remain closed throughout a one-week recess set to start on Monday. Neither Cotton's nor Cruz's office are in the same Senate office building as Cantwell — the GOP senators offices are in Russell, Cantwell's is in Hart — but the decision underscores the growing anxiety on Capitol Hill. It's the latest change as staff and lawmakers try to prevent a widespread outbreak on Capitol Hill. The advanced age of most lawmakers, as well as the close proximity they have to tourists, has sparked days of anxiety about what if, any steps, would be taken to limit access to the building. Cantwell announced that she was closing her office for a deep clean after a staffer tested positive. The Capitol is also set to suspend all tours until April and limit who can access the House and Senate office buildings. \"We are taking this temporary action out of concern for the health and safety of congressional employees as well as the public. We appreciate the understanding of those with planned visits interrupted by this necessary, but prudent, decision,\" Paul Irving, the House sergeant at arms, and Michael Stenger, the Senate sergeant at arms, said in a joint statement. —Updated at 10:48 a.m. View the discussion thread.

The other candidates will show up like they're supposed to, and they'll stand at their podiums answering questions. Some opinion writers will spin theories like, \"Trump doesn't really want to win\" or \"This will be what finally does Trump in.\" Some anti-Trump Republicans will believe this is the other candidates' chance to shine. They'll talk about their first-month-in-office goals. They'll talk about their policies and tax plans. Nobody will mention that Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are on the ends because they barely got in, but there may be some old-school prepackaged zingers. Someone will unleash one of those zingers and think it will make a great sound bite for the media to play over and over. He won't understand that \"the zinger\" is a dead art; a relic for future archaeologists. They'll dust it off and discover Trump's teeth marks on it. That's all old paradigm stuff, the way elections were in the before times — before Trump. When he looks at the rest of the candidates on the debate stage, all he's going to see is a bunch of people trying to jam an eight-track into a CD player. Trump won't miss making news by skipping the debate. Trump is the news. I wrote last week in The Hill that the Republican Party and the media don't pull Trump's strings; he pulls theirs. This is what I meant. This is Trump pulling the media's strings. After the debate, the big story isn't going to be what former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio argued civilly about or whose flat tax proposal The Wall Street Journal likes best. The story is going to be whatever Trump did instead of the debate. Will missing the debate hurt or help Trump? What did he tweet while the debate was on? Did anybody watch the debate? Did the numbers go down? Are Iowans offended? I don't know if Iowans will be offended. I know I'm not, and here's why. If elections had titles, this one would be called the \"tapping into anger\" election. All we ever hear about is the anger that Trump is tapping into. These old-paradigm politicians are the source of that anger. Over the last few years, our politicians have deserted accountability and left it for dead. The debt keeps going up. The IRS targets Americans for their politics and Lois Lerner's hard drive is M.I.A. Americans are meant to believe that men who were on the ground in Benghazi know less about what happened there than politicians and left-wing bloggers. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton stored classified emails on her personal server. \"El Chapo\" ran around with fast and furious guns. And nobody is accountable for any of this. And none of the politicians in the government can do anything about any of it as long as the wrongdoers keep up their lies. From the average American living room, it has become clear that the only laws our politicians are bound by are the laws of presenting themselves perfectly in front of the TV cameras and nailing the preprepared soundbites. Basically, try to keep the B.S. thick enough that nobody sees through it. The coming Trump victory is simply a continuation of what happened in 2010 and 2014. He has his faults, but so what? People are tired of watching politicians try to present themselves as perfect. Say the right thing. Wear the right clothes. Smile more. Get some boots that add an inch. Use this term, don't use that term. Someone might get mad. Someone might be bothered. Trump says what he wants, even if it leaves everyone mad and bothered. Trump is real, and he clearly has no patience for B.S. Like the rest of them, he isn't perfect. The difference is, everyone else is pretending to be. The other candidates are desperate to keep playing by the old rules, but Trump destroyed those rules. I woke up yesterday morning excited about tomorrow's debate. Today, I woke up excited to see what Trump will do instead of the debate. That's why Trump has already won. Zipperer is assistant professor of political science at Georgia Military College.

It is a pandemic that has gotten worse before it will get better because of his inaction,\" Pelosi said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\" \"In fact, clearly, it is the Trump virus,\" Pelosi added, reiterating the phrase later in the interview as well. The Democratic leader was responding to the president's briefing at the White House earlier Tuesday in which he praised the use of face masks and urged Americans to wash their hands and practice physical distancing to stem the spread of the virus. During the briefing — the president's first coronavirus-focused White House briefing in nearly three months — Trump also warned that the outbreak in the U.S. will \"get worse before it gets better\" amid surges in parts of the country. \"If he had said months ago, let's wear masks, let’s not — let’s socially distance instead of having rallies and whatever they were, then more people would have followed his lead,\" Pelosi argued on CNN. \"He's the president of the United States.\" Pressed by CNN host Wolf Blitzer on whether she was asserting that thousands of Americans had died because of the president’s response, Pelosi responded, “Yes, that's what I am saying. I think it's clearly evident.” The comments mark one of the strongest rebukes yet of Trump’s handling of the pandemic, which Democrats maintain could have been more aggressively dealt with by the White House. The criticism, which centers around Trump’s early reluctance to wear a mask and barbs from some White House aides directed at health officials such as Anthony FauciAnthony FauciFauci says he would support vaccine requirements for air travel FDA 'eager' for vaccine for kids, but no firm timeline As COVID-19 evolves, our behavior must evolve with it MORE, has been amplified amid a spike in coronavirus cases across the country, particularly in the South and West. “We’re approaching 4 million. We’re approaching 4 million people infected, people affected by this, infected by it, and a large number, like 140,000, who have passed away. If it's important to wear a mask now, it would have been important to wear it in March instead of telling us that by April we would all be going to church together. I wish that were the case, but he had no scientific basis for that,” Pelosi said. “If they don’t return to science and governance — and that’s a way that we can overcome this. We have hope and prayers for a vaccine. God willing that will be soon. But it is still months away, and people will die. So let's hope that the president comes closer to embracing the reality of this pandemic, this Trump virus.” In apparent recognition of the burgeoning health crisis, Trump has expressed more openness to masks, posting a picture on Twitter of him wearing one and urging Americans to more strictly adhere to health guidance from federal officials. “It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better,” Trump said Tuesday. “We’re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask,” he added. “Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They’ll have an effect, and we need everything we can get.” View the discussion thread.

But, as I would with any credible evidence of a crime unearthed in the course of our investigations, I feel obliged to pass that information along to the Justice Department for appropriate review,” Grassley said in a statement. Graham added that \"after reviewing how Mr. Steele conducted himself in distributing information contained in the dossier and how many stop signs the DOJ ignored in its use of the dossier, I believe that a special counsel needs to review this matter.\" The letter is the first known criminal referral from any of the congressional investigations into Russia's election interference. As part of their request, the two senators passed along a memo tied to \"certain communications between Christopher Steele and multiple U.S. news outlets.\" They did not publicly release the memorandum, which is classified. The referral is the latest sign of partisan splintering of the Judiciary Committee's wide-ranging investigation into Russia, the 2016 election and potential political interference of the FBI. Sen. Dianne FeinsteinDianne Emiel FeinsteinFormer California senator prods Feinstein to consider retirement Lobbying world Why the pro-choice movement must go on the offensive MORE (Calif.), the top Democrat on the panel, blasted the letter as the latest attempt by GOP lawmakers to turn the committee's focus away from Trump. \"I think this referral is unfortunate as it’s clearly another effort to deflect attention from what should be the committee’s top priority: determining whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election and whether there was subsequent obstruction of justice,\" she said. Feinstein said she and the other Democrats on the panel were not consulted about the referral. The Justice Department isn't required to open up an investigation in response to Grassley and Graham's letter. And Grassley's office, in announcing their request, noted that it's standard for the committee to notify the Justice Department when it \"comes across what appears to be credible evidence of a criminal violation that warrants further investigation by appropriate authorities based on information from any source, public or non-public.\" The referral comes days after the latest public back-and-forth between Grassley and Fusion GPS, the research firm that hired Steele to compile the controversial dossier. The firm and Steele have been a major target of Grassley, who has sent a flurry of letters trying to find out the extent of the FBI's contact with Steele as well as who Steele's sources are. A lawyer for Fusion GPS fired back at the referral, saying that \"we should all be skeptical in the extreme.\" \"Publicizing a criminal referral based on classified information raises serious questions about whether this letter is nothing more than another attempt to discredit government sources, in the midst of an ongoing investigation,\" the firm's counsel said. The dossier has become a flashpoint in the Russia investigations, with Republicans questioning whether the document was the starting point for the FBI's investigation of the Trump campaign. Some of the allegations in the dossier have been shown to be false, while others have either been supported by public evidence or remain unproven. The Justice Department referral, according to Grassley's office, is not tied to the \"veracity of claims contained in the dossier\" and is not \"intended to be an allegation of a crime.\" \"Maybe there is some innocent explanation for the inconsistencies we have seen, but it seems unlikely. In any event, it’s up to the Justice Department to figure that out,\" Grassley added in his statement. Steele, a former British intelligence officer, rocketed into the political spotlight in early 2017 after the Wall Street Journal reported that he was the author of the Trump dossier. The FBI reportedly agreed to pay Steele to continue investigating Trump's ties to Moscow after the U.S. intelligence community concluded that the Kremlin had run an influence campaign to sway the presidential election in Trump's favor. But those payments never materialized after Steele's identity was compromised.

We’re gonna get it done.”Eighteen Democrats are publicly backing the trade-promotion authority (TPA) bill, known as fast-track, which passed the Senate with bipartisan support last month. But a number of undecided Democrats being targeted by Obama — including Reps. G.K. ButterfieldGeorge (G.K.) Kenneth ButterfieldHouse Democrats push to introduce John Lewis voting rights bill within weeks Black Caucus presses Democratic leaders to expedite action on voting rights Democratic clamor grows for select committee on Jan. 6 attack MORE (N.C.), John Carney (Del.) and Cedric Richmond (La.) — said last week that they're leaning against it.“People have been contacting me now for about seven or eight months, [and] 100 percent of them have been asking me to vote no,” said Richmond, who represents most of New Orleans. “And I told the president in our conversation that he was the first call asking me to vote for it. And I think that shocked him that my business community — considering I have the large port and all these other businesses — have never reached out.”Democratic support will be vital to the fate of the measure, as GOP leaders don't have the 217 or 218 votes — pending a replacement for Aaron Schock (R-Ill.) — to pass it through the lower chamber on their own. They face strong headwinds from conservatives wary of granting additional authority to a president they don’t trust to use it wisely.“We could wait another 18 months until this administration is out,” Rep. Ted YohoTheodore (Ted) Scott YohoOcasio-Cortez on Taylor Greene: 'These are the kinds of people that I threw out of bars all the time' Ocasio-Cortez: 'No consequences' in GOP for violence, racism 7 surprise moments from a tumultuous year in politics MORE (R-Fla.), a TPA opponent, said Thursday. “You look at how they negotiated the release of the Taliban Five; you look at how they negotiated what they've done with Cuba; look at how they've negotiated what we've done with the Iran nuclear deal — I personally don't want them negotiating anything else.”Ryan countered that TPA actually “constrains the president,” requiring administration officials to follow guidelines set by Congress and frequently brief lawmakers about any progress in negotiations. Members also can sit in on the talks.And he’s been making the case to conservatives that the agreement to curb Tehran’s nuclear program would have been much stronger had a “TPA for Iran” been in place.“It puts Congress in charge. It empowers us, not him,” said Ryan, the GOP’s 2012 vice presidential nominee and a respected voice on Capitol Hill. “It brings more accountability, more transparency, more congressional control over the process.”Republicans familiar with the vote-counting operation say they’ve steadily been picking up new “yes” votes on trade and that the numbers are moving in the right direction. In fact, Ryan, after the last vote series of the week Thursday, told reporters he had just secured “several” new TPA supporters on the House floor, though he wouldn’t name names.“The momentum is on our side,” said a senior GOP leadership aide.Perhaps sensing that shift, a number of liberal groups launched an eleventh-hour push Friday urging House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to take a strong stand against the fast-track bill. Pelosi has expressed strong objections to parts of Obama’s trade agenda. But along with other top Democrats — including Reps. Steny Hoyer (Md.) and James Clyburn (S.C.) — she hasn't taken a public position on either the TPA or an emerging Pacific Rim deal opposed by an overwhelming majority of the caucus she leads. That silence stands in sharp contrast to the vocal opposition of Senate Minority Leader Harry ReidHarry Mason ReidJustice Breyer issues warning on remaking Supreme Court: 'What goes around comes around' Manchin, Sanders set for clash over Biden spending package Harry Reid renews call for filibuster to be abolished: 'We need to get the Senate working again' MORE (D-Nev.), who led an unsuccessful fight against the TPA bill in the upper chamber. And it has angered liberals who want her to rally Democrats against Obama’s trade agenda.\"House Democrats are under intense pressure from the president, from Republicans, and from big corporations to support Fast Track,\" Jim Dean, the head of Democracy for America, a progressive PAC, said in an email urging members to sign a petition calling on Pelosi to lead the opposition charge. \"If Nancy Pelosi comes out against Fast Track, that will help give those Democrats important cover to stand up to the rich and powerful and stop this bad deal.\"House Democratic trade supporters, meanwhile, are scrambling alongside the White House to pull their colleagues behind the TPA. Those lawmakers — including Reps.

But you're trusting the president to put the best thing out there,\" Quigley said. \"[Obama is] the ideal president to cut this deal,\" he added. \"When is it going to get better?\" The TPA bill would grant Congress an up-or-down vote on Obama's trade deals, but prohibit amendments or a filibuster in the Senate. The extra authority is seen as a necessary step in the president's bid to finalize the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sweeping accord with Japan and 10 other nations. The pact has emerged as the top economic priority of Obama’s second term.On Capitol Hill, rumors are running rampant about the whip count, with often-conflicting figures being floated by both sides.Last week, Obama told Himes that he believed he had 20 Democratic votes lined up for TPA, The Wall Street Journal reported. But a member of the pro-TPA Democratic whip team told lawmakers that number might now be as high as 25 or 26, said one Democrat who was informed of the figure.“That was higher than I thought,” said the Democrat, who has already pledged to vote against TPA. Republican leaders have been reluctant to share exactly how many votes they’ve lined up, but leadership allies have said they will need to deliver at least 190 votes given the overwhelming Democratic opposition.And Rep. Matt SalmonMatthew (Matt) James SalmonThe Hill's Morning Report - After high-stakes Biden-Putin summit, what now? Former Rep. Matt Salmon launches gubernatorial bid in Arizona On The Trail: Arizona is microcosm of battle for the GOP MORE (R-Ariz.), one of the rare conservatives backing TPA, said party leaders still had a long way to go before getting to their target, which he believes is closer to 195 votes.“They’re clearly in trouble. They’ve postponed everything for another week,” Salmon said in an interview. “We were told they were gonna vote on it [this] week, and now it’s going to be the week after. “My guess is, and it’s just a gut feeling, they are probably 15 to 20 votes away,” he added.There's also a growing concern among liberal Democrats over a $700 million offset provision for the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, a piece of the Trans-Pacific Partnership providing health insurance, retraining and other help to U.S. workers negatively affected by the deal. The cost would be offset by cuts to Medicare.Behind Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the leaders of the Progressive Caucus, more than 50 House Democrats wrote to Boehner and Pelosi last week warning that the Medicare offset would undermine a program on which more than 50 million seniors rely. And Pelosi has endorsed that message, saying the Medicare provision is \"a non-starter\" for House Democrats.\"It has to be paid for, let's find a pay-for,\" she told reporters Thursday. \"Let's not take it at a place that hurts the very people that we're trying to help.\" View the discussion thread.

All Rights Reserved A top official at the Department of Education resigned Tuesday over an apparent dispute with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Politico reported. James Runcie, the head of the Education Department's student aid office, resigned abruptly Tuesday night after DeVos asked him to testify before the House Oversight Committee about his department's rising levels of improper payment rate for federal student aid programs. Runcie apparently believed he was the wrong person to testify on the matter and resigned after multiple requests from agency officials. He had previously refused requests from the House committee to testify, as well as requests from other officials at the Education Department. An unnamed Education Department official told Politico that Runcie's resignation was baffling, with other Education employees confused about his reason. “That’s what we’re trying to figure out,” the official said. “We don’t know.” An email obtained by Politico said that Runcie \"felt it was time to give an opportunity to someone else to provide leadership under a new Secretary of Education.” Runcie joined the Department of Education in 2011 and became a source of controversy soon after.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved The White House's coronavirus stimulus plan could see every American get two $1,000 checks from the government within nine weeks, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Thursday. \"This is an unprecedented situation, where for good reason the government has instructed major parts of the economy to close down so that we can win this fight against this virus,\" he said in an appearance on Fox Business. \"While we're doing that, we understand there are impacts on hard-working Americans, and the president is determined to support them,\" he added. The $1 trillion package the White House and Senate Republicans plan on presenting would provide every adult American with a $1,000 check, plus another $500 for each child. A family with two parents and two children, for example, would get $3,000. \"As soon as Congress passes this we'd get this out in three weeks, and then six weeks later, if the president still has a national emergency, we'll deliver another $3,000,\" Mnuchin said. Earlier in the week, Mnuchin had pointed to a two-week target to send out cash payments. That portion would amount to half of the bill's overall spending. Another $300 billion in the bill would be used to help businesses keep people on payroll and offer loan forgiveness for those that do after the crisis ends. Already, unemployment claims have shot up by some 33 percent between the first two weeks of March. A final $200 billion would be devoted to securing lending to airlines and other critical industries hit hard by the pandemic. The bill would be the third, and largest, in the government's response to coronavirus. The first $8.3 billion law focused on health agencies and first responders, while the second, which Trump signed Wednesday, put roughly $104 billion toward emergency paid leave, free coronavirus testing and expanded unemployment insurance.

All Rights Reserved Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier BecerraXavier BecerraBiden administration releases B in COVID-19 relief for providers White House plan backs Medicare drug price negotiation Nursing homes warn vaccine mandate could lead to staff shortages MORE declared Thursday that \"it is absolutely the government's business\" to know people's vaccination status, arguing the federal government has a vested interest in keeping Americans safe. “The federal government has spent trillions of dollars to try and keep Americans alive during this pandemic,\" Becerra said on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"So it is absolutely the government's business, it is taxpayers' business, if we have to continue to spend money to try and keep people from contracting COVID.\" HHS @SecBecerra: \"The federal government has spent trillions of dollars to keep Americans alive during this pandemic. So it is absolutely the government's business [to know who is vaccinated.] It is taxpayers' business if we have to continue to spend money\" pic.twitter.com/AzLF0I18HF The HHS chief demurred when pressed on whether the Biden administration would push to require proof for vaccinations, as advocated by some health experts, maintaining it should be left up to states and local governments. \"We want to give people the sense that they have the freedom to choose, but we hope that they choose to live,\" he added when pressed. The concept of \"vaccine passports\" has previously drawn fierce pushback from GOP governors and civil rights advocates, among others, and the White House earlier this year ruled out the administration playing any role in such a system, indicating it would defer to private companies if they wanted to institute a system to require proof of vaccination. In a tweet later on Thursday, Becerra attempted to clarify his remarks. \"Some comments I made today are being taken wildly out of context,\" he said. \"To be clear: government has no database tracking who is vaccinated. We're encouraging people to step up to protect themselves, others by getting vaccinated. It's the best way to save lives and end this pandemic.\" Becerra's remarks come a day after President BidenJoe BidenFBI releases first Sept. 11 document following Biden executive order Afghan pilots to be transferred to US base after fleeing to Uzbekistan: WSJ NATO head says alliance signed off on US withdrawal from Afghanistan MORE suggested that door-to-door community outreach would be one of the ways to promote the COVID-19 vaccine and ease concerns of those hesitant to receive it, as the administration seeks to boost vaccination numbers. “Please get vaccinated now. It works. It’s free,” Biden said during a speech while discussing the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus, which is now the dominant strain in the country. Health experts have said that vaccines appear to be effective against the variant. “It’s never been easier, and it’s never been more important,\" Biden continued Wednesday, urging vaccinations. \"Do it now for yourself and the people you care about, for your neighborhood, for your country. It sounds corny, but it’s a patriotic thing to do.” Biden's comments sparked some pushback from conservative Republicans, including Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich. “Americans trust medical researchers and their family doctors to provide information and recommendations to make personal decisions but they do not trust government intrusion or the politicization of the health care process,” Brnovich said in a letter to the White House this week. \"I, along with many Arizonans, was greatly alarmed by your White House indicating that it might be in possession of medical records revealing the contact information for Americans who have not been vaccinated ... If this is the case, this is a severe breach of privacy, and I will not tolerate such intrusions within Arizona.\" Becerra maintained that HHS and others in the administration have a duty to make sure that all Americans can \"prosper and freely associate\" following the pandemic, saying ensuring as many people in the country are vaccinated as possible is key to that prerogative. \"Knocking on a door has never been against the law, you don't have to answer,\" he said. \"But we hope you do, because if you do we can hopefully help dispel some of those rumors that you've heard and hopefully get you vaccinated.\" Updated 1:29 p.m. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Republicans on Friday called for a comprehensive review of the U.S. visa system after reports that the female attacker in the San Bernardino mass shooting pledged allegiance on Facebook to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The suspect, Tashfeen Malik, came to the U.S. on a special K-1 visa last year, raising new questions about potential vulnerabilities in the immigration system. That special K-1 visa allows foreigners to come to America to marry a U.S. citizen. Under the rules, a couple must wed within 90 days or face deportation of the foreign individual. FBI officials confirmed Friday they are investigating the San Bernardino shooting as an act of terrorism. Lawmakers are pledging a close review of the K-1 visas, but time restraints could make it difficult for lawmakers to address potential K-1 security gaps before leaving Washington for the holidays. “In light of the renewed terrorist threat, we need to take a look at our entire visa program to enhance our national security. This incident highlights the very real security threat throughout the system,” Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.), the GOP Policy Committee chairman and a member of leadership, told The Hill on Friday. “Experts in the field now say that terrorists recognize that passports, visas and immigration documents are now weapons in the war on terror.” But Messer said it would be difficult — though not impossible — to deal with K-1 visas in the visa-waivers bill that the House is expected to pass net week. “We need to look at K-1 visas as part of the broader policy debate,” he added. “If it can’t be dealt with next week, it will need to be dealt with early next year.” Conservative GOP Rep.

Listen to Donald Trump MORE (R-Ala.), the chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, is pushing for a full review of all immigration programs in the wake of recent terror threats. “Under current visa policies, we are going to permanently resettle more migrants from Muslim countries over the next five years than the population of Washington, D.C.,” a GOP subcommittee aide said. “We need to do a complete review of our immigration programs — not just to prevent the entry of extremists, but to address the problem of post-entry and second-generation radicalization.” Malik and her American-born husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, are said to have carried out this week’s attack in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 and wounded 21. Born in Pakistan, Malik had traveled to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia in July 2014 on a K-1 visa, FBI officials said. According to The New York Times, Farook applied for a permanent resident green card for Malik in September 2014. A conditional green card was granted earlier this summer but only after the couple proved their marriage was legitimate and after Malik passed criminal and national security background checks. A top GOP leadership aide said Republicans are still waiting for federal investigators to provide more information regarding the reported links between the San Bernardino attack and ISIS, “as well as how and when these individuals were radicalized.” It's unclear at this point whether Malik had been influenced by ISIS during her time in the Middle East or if that happened after she moved to the U.S. last year. It is also unclear whether she coordinated with the group or acted alone. Responding to the deadly ISIS attacks in Paris three weeks ago, Republicans rolled out legislation Thursday that aims to shore up security gaps in the program that lets foreigners from friendly countries travel to the U.S. without obtaining a visa. That legislation could also get attached to an omnibus spending bill that Congress needs to pass by Dec. 11 to avert a government shutdown. But, with omnibus negotiations heading toward the finish line, it seems unlikely Congress has time to address the alleged terrorist links in the San Bernardino shooting. Homeland Security Committee Vice Chair Candice Miller (R-Mich.), who authored the visa-waiver bill, is still expecting it to hit the floor in its current form next week, an aide said. Under current law, travelers from 38 countries can obtain visa waivers to expedite their visits to the United States. The Miller bill would change that system by installing new visa requirements for any potential tourists who have visited Iraq, Syria, Iran or Sudan over the past five years, regardless of their country of origin. It would also empower the administration to suspend countries from the program if they withhold certain information designed to gauge potential threats to U.S. security. “The fact is, as evidenced by the horrific attacks in Paris, terrorist organizations like ISIS are looking for any and every opportunity to exploit a nation’s hospitality to carry out their barbaric attacks against the innocent,” said Miller, who Speaker Paul RyanPaul Davis RyanPaul Ryan says it's 'really clear' Biden won election: 'It was not rigged.

Senate Finance Chairman Orrin HatchOrrin Grant HatchCongress, stop holding 'Dreamers' hostage Drug prices are declining amid inflation fears The national action imperative to achieve 30 by 30 MORE (R-Utah) and House Ways and Means Chairman Paul RyanPaul Davis RyanPaul Ryan says it's 'really clear' Biden won election: 'It was not rigged. It was not stolen' Democrats fret over Trump-district retirements ahead of midterms To cut poverty and solve the labor shortage, enhance the Earned Income Tax Credit MORE (R-Wis.) want input on how tax reform can help those businesses — known as pass-throughs — even if it doesn’t reduce the top individual rate, which currently hovers near 40 percent. President Obama has made it clear that they won’t back any plan that reduces that top individual rate, which Democrats finally got raised in early 2013 after years of fighting. The White House and other Democrats have said they’re interested in overhauling the tax code for businesses. “We are looking for ideas on how to reduce the effective tax rate without reducing the statutory tax rates in a manner that will make small businesses more competitive and better able to invest, grow, hire, and increase wages for their employees,” Hatch and Ryan wrote to members of the Coalition for Fair Effective Tax Rates on Monday. In their letter, Hatch and Ryan acknowledged that tax reform that lowers the top individual rate would have to wait until at least 2017, when the White House has a new occupant. But they also insisted that they were willing to work with Obama on getting “a first phase of tax reform focused in part on business income” completed, and then doubling back for individuals. “While the reality is that the statutory tax rates for pass-through businesses will have to wait until the next president, there are reforms we can enact now that will lower the effective tax rate on pass-through businesses,” Hatch and Ryan wrote to the business group. Both Hatch and Ryan had previously suggested that they’re willing to work with the White House on an overhaul of the tax code that drops the top corporate rate from 35 percent while still falling short of being comprehensive. But lawmakers in both parties have questioned that approach, making the case that it will be difficult to reach two tax reform deals in quick succession. Congress and the White House will also have to hurry if there’s to be any tax reform agreement before Obama leaves office. With the 2016 presidential campaign already heating up, Ryan and others have said that Washington will have to have made significant tax reform progress by this summer for tax reform to have a chance before 2017. In their Monday letter, Hatch and Ryan asked for businesses to weigh in by the end of May. Small business advocates like the National Federation of Independent Business have openly worried for years that tax reform would roll back tax incentives that pass-throughs use without lowering their tax rates. NFIB, the Retail Industry Leaders Association and the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors are among the roughly 70 national groups in the effective tax rate coalition. Still, figuring out how to deal with pass-through businesses might be one of the more difficult question for tax writers, but it’s also far from the only one. Democrats and Republicans, for instance, still have to bridge gaps over whether tax reform should raise new revenue for the Treasury and offshore corporate income. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Conservative author and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi on Sunday filed a lawsuit against special counsel Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerSenate Democrats urge Garland not to fight court order to release Trump obstruction memo Why a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel MORE, alleging that Mueller illegally surveilled him as part of the investigation. Corsi, in the document filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia, also claims that Mueller’s office leaked confidential information surrounding Corsi’s testimony before the special counsel’s grand jury. “Defendant Mueller and his prosecutorial and media staff, acting in their official capacity and personally, also illegally released grand jury information to harm Plaintiff Corsi by attempting to destroy his reputation and personal and professional well-being and livelihood, thus also attempting to drive him into bankruptcy,” the document reads in part. The special counsel's office declined to comment to The Hill. The lawsuit is also filed against the Department of Justice, the FBI, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA. Corsi has previously filed a complaint with the Justice Department over the Mueller investigation, requesting that criminal and ethical investigations be opened up into the special counsel's office. Larry Klayman, Corsi's attorney and the founder of conservative watchdogs Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch, claimed in a statement that Mueller and his team \"are allegedly themselves acting in a criminal manner to further their attempted 'legal coup d'etat' to remove the president from office by any illegal means.\" Both documents came after Corsi himself acknowledged that he will likely face an indictment from the special counsel in the near future. He made public last month a plea deal offer from Mueller, in which Corsi would have pleaded guilty to one count of making false claims to investigators in exchange for no prison time. Corsi said he rejected the offer, and that he is prepared to die in prison. In Sunday's lawsuit, Corsi alleges that Mueller's team took actions \"intended to coerce, extort, threaten and/or blackmail him into submission and designed to remove the current president of the United States for political and other improper purposes.\" The document claims that the Justice Department, FBI, NSA and CIA — in addition to Mueller — \"have engaged in ongoing illegal, unconstitutional surveillance\" on Corsi, violating his Fourth Amendment rights as well as other U.S. laws. The conspiracy theorist also claimed that Mueller's team had leaked information about Corsi to the media. The document pointed to an ABC News article about the special counsel's examination of Corsi, claiming it included details that \"could only possibly have come from Defendant Mueller.\" Those details include that Corsi has become a \"central person of interest\" to the special counsel, and that Mueller had evidence suggesting that Corsi had prior knowledge of WikiLeaks's release of hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Corsi is requesting an injunction in his case, as well as $350 million in damages.

The men had exchanged emails about possible documents obtained by WikiLeaks, before the group released emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has also recently tweeted about Corsi's case, using it to attack Mueller while acknowledging that he does not know Corsi personally. Both Trump and Corsi were proponents of the \"birther\" conspiracy theory, claiming without evidence that former President Obama was not born in the United States. Obama eventually released his birth certificate, showing that he was born in Hawaii, to counter the allegations. Updated Monday at 9:24 a.m. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved When President Trump tweets, Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill may see stars. But the Republican National Committee (RNC) sees dollar signs.The RNC has raised more than $104 million since Trump took office in January, fueled by a surge in donors who have never contributed to the party before. For the first time in recent memory, Republicans are raking in more money from those small-dollar donors than they are from big-spending whales who write four- or five-figure checks.The surge in contributions has given Republicans a clear financial advantage a year before the midterm elections, an edge some Democrats see as threatening to their hopes of capitalizing on anti-Trump anger both among their base and among independent voters. “I do think the Republican spending advantage is back,” said Kelly Ward, a former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). “Democrats have worked hard to close the spending gap over the past few cycles, but the Republican donors are scared of losing power and are turning on the spigots.”The Republican National Committee ended September with $44 million in the bank, according to its latest filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The Democratic National Committee (DNC), which emerged from a devastating loss in 2016 and a contentious leadership fight earlier this year, has only $7 million on hand, new FEC reports show. Since the election, the RNC has averaged raising $3.7 million a month in itemized contributions, donations over $200 for which the party has to report the names and occupations of donors. At the same time, the RNC has averaged $4.9 million in un-itemized contributions, donations that come in under $200. During President Obama’s second term in office, the RNC was much more reliant on big donors. The party took in $14 million more in itemized donations than in un-itemized donations. During Trump’s first nine months in office, un-itemized small-dollar contributions have outpaced itemized big-dollar donations by nearly $13 million. The RNC’s edge over the DNC has not trickled down to either party’s congressional committees. The DCCC has raised $81.4 million this year, more than the National Republican Congressional Committee's (NRCC) $72.6 million. (The NRCC maintains a cash on hand advantage of $8.6 million.) The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has outraised the National Republican Senatorial Committee by a margin of about $4 million since January. All told, the three Republican committees have about $97 million in the bank. The three Democratic committees ended September with about $54 million on hand.Republican insiders say success has bred success, up and down the ballot.“We’ve been able to break every fundraising record in history,” said Ron Kaufman, a former chairman of the RNC’s budget committee. “It helps to have a House and a Senate. It helps to have two thirds of the governors Republican. It helps to have a gain of a thousand legislative seats across the country. And it helps to win elections.”It also helps when the face of the Republican Party, Trump, communicates so openly with his base of rabid fans. The RNC uses Trump’s tweets to channel his voice, soliciting contributions and messages of support when the president calls for building a wall along the border with Mexico or picks a fight with Senate Democrats. Those more personalized pitches, crafted in Trump’s voice, have spurred a wave of more than 300,000 first-time contributors.“We don’t have to guess how the president would speak about an issue, because Americans hear directly from him on Twitter,” said Cassie Smedile, an RNC spokeswoman. “We can emulate his words and his voice when communicating with our supporters.”One of the RNC’s most significant online fundraising campaigns this year has revolved around a petition to support building the border wall. Another was a birthday card from first lady Melania Trump to the president. Some Democrats worry that the cash advantage will allow Republicans to begin advertising far earlier than their candidates can, effectively defining the candidates — and shaping races — in the GOP’s favor, even in a year that should favor Democrats.“The DNC does need to get its act together,” said Martin Frost, a former Texas congressman who headed the DCCC while in office. “There is a real sense that we actually have a shot at the House even though the districts were drawn against us.”While the RNC and the DNC typically reserve their money for presidential elections, both committees are spending this year in ways they hope will help up and down the ballot. The RNC in August hired 17 new state directors, who will be on the ground in battleground states during the midterm elections. The DNC has invested money in hopes of keeping Virginia’s governorship, and in a state Senate race in Washington State that could flip control of the chamber if Democrats win a special election.“The building’s been smart about the way they’ve invested money,” Kaufman said of the RNC. “We invested more money in data and technology than ever before.”DNC officials say their fundraising is on pace with previous off-year elections, and that they expect the House and Senate committees — which face crucial elections next year — to raise the bulk of the money. And many Democrats said an explosion of outside groups, from super PACs to labor unions, simply means there are more avenues for money to find its way into politics these days.“I’m not overly worried because resources are flowing through so many different vehicles, which, taken as a whole, represents a great deal of potential,” said Hari Sevugan, a former DNC spokesman who now works as a Democratic strategist. “The fact that we have a number of well-resourced groups means we can work on different points of attack at the same time.”For the moment, the top Republican super PACs maintain a cash edge over their Democratic counterparts too. The Senate Leadership Fund had $8 million on hand in the first week of September, compared with $4.5 million for the Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC, which last reported at the end of June. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the GOP’s House super PAC, had $3.5 million in the bank at the beginning of July, versus $1.4 million for the Democratic-backing House Majority PAC.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Republican-led House and Senate committees are investigating whether leaders of the Russia counterintelligence investigation had contacts with the news media that resulted in improper leaks, prompted in part by text messages amongst senior FBI officials mentioning specific reporters, news organizations and articles. In one exchange, FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok and bureau lawyer Lisa Page engaged in a series of texts shortly before Election Day 2016 suggesting they knew in advance about an article in The Wall Street Journal and would need to feign stumbling onto the story so it could be shared with colleagues. “Article is out, but hidden behind paywall so can’t read it,” Page texted Strzok on Oct. 24, 2016. “Wsj? Boy that was fast,” Strzok texted back, using the initials of the famed financial newspaper. “Should I ‘find’ it and tell the team?” The text messages, which were reviewed by The Hill, show the two FBI agents discussed how they might make it appear they innocently discovered the article, such as through Google News alerts. “I can get it like I do every other article that hits any Google News alerts, seriously,” Strzok wrote, adding he didn’t want his team hearing about the article “from someone else.” Strzok played a key role in the early Russia election meddling probe before he was removed last summer by special counsel Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) MuellerSenate Democrats urge Garland not to fight court order to release Trump obstruction memo Why a special counsel is guaranteed if Biden chooses Yates, Cuomo or Jones as AG Barr taps attorney investigating Russia probe origins as special counsel MORE for exchanging text messages critical of President TrumpDonald TrumpCapitol Police recommend disciplinary action for six officers in Jan. 6 internal probe Biden defends Afghanistan withdrawal on 9/11 Will the US emulate China's tech takedown? MORE, then still a candidate, with Page. The Justice Department has told Congress that Strzok had engaged in an affair with Page, who served as a lawyer advising FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. The Hill reviewed nearly three dozen texts in which the two agents discussed articles, tried to track down information about a specific New York Times reporter or opined about leaked information in stories that they fretted were “super specific.” Republican investigators in both the House and Senate say the text messages suggest FBI personnel may have had media contacts but don’t necessarily prove it. So they want to learn more about what the two agents were talking about and whether any FBI officials involved in the Russia probe engaged in leaking, sources told The Hill. President Trump has bitterly complained about leaks in the Russia probe, suggesting the investigation had created a false narrative about his campaign and early administration. And FBI officials have taken the rare step of denouncing a few major stories in the Russia case as inaccurate. FBI contacts with the media wouldn’t necessarily be improper unless they resulted in the release of confidential law enforcement information or classified information, such as the leak last February of an intercept of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn’s contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. The Justice Department says it currently has 27 ongoing criminal leak investigations, triple the amount of the prior three years combined. FBI and Justice Department officials declined to comment about the Strzok-Page texts, noting the Justice Department inspector general is currently investigating the messages and any political bias or other wrongdoing that may have occurred in the Russia case. Former FBI Director James ComeyJames Brien ComeyGiuliani told investigators it was OK to 'throw a fake' during campaign DOJ watchdog unable to determine if FBI fed Giuliani information ahead of 2016 election Biden sister has book deal, set to publish in April MORE, on whose watch the Russia case began, has previously testified he did not authorize or engage in leaking while in office, though he admitted arranging a leak after he was fired by President Trump last spring in hopes it would prompt a special prosecutor appointment. Separately, the House Intelligence Committee says it has obtained information that Mueller’s current deputy in the Russia probe, respected Justice Department financial fraud prosecutor Andrew Weissman, had contact with the news media last April, shortly before Mueller was named special prosecutor, according to a letter the committee has sent the department. In a deal with current FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod RosensteinRod RosensteinWashington still needs more transparency House Judiciary to probe DOJ's seizure of data from lawmakers, journalists The Hill's Morning Report - Biden-Putin meeting to dominate the week MORE, Justice officials have promised to provide the Intelligence Committee with information on the Weismann contacts later this week. “I understand that your office is researching records related to the details of an April 2017 meeting between DOJ Attorney Andrew Weissman (now the senior attorney for Special Counsel Robert Mueller) and the media, which will also be provided to this Committee by close of business on Thursday, January 11, 2018,” Chairman Devin NunesDevin Gerald NunesLIVE COVERAGE: Ways and Means begins Day 2 on .5T package Biden faces unfinished mission of evacuating Americans Nunes sues MSNBC, alleging Rachel Maddow defamed him MORE (R-Calif.) wrote in the letter. Whatever Congress ultimately determines, the Strzok-Page text messages already provided to lawmakers show the two FBI agents were closely monitoring leaks in the news media and had strong opinions about reporters and media personalities. In one string of text messages just five days before Election Day 2016, Page, the lawyer, alerted Strzok, the counterintelligence agent, to a story in The Washington Post about a timeline in the controversial Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonSchumer remembers 9/11: 'Oh my God, this is World War III' Bidens, former presidents mark 9/11 anniversary Why is Biden hesitating to challenge China as East Asia's major trade partner? MORE email investigation. Page mentions a conversation she had just had with FBI chief of staff James Rybicki and openly expressed concern the information about the FBI’s timeline was too specific for comfort in the article. “Sorry, Rybicki called. Time line article in the post (sic) is super specific and not good. Doesn’t make sense because I didn’t have specific information to give.” A few days earlier Strzok texted Page about another new article, suggesting it was anti-FBI. “Yep, the whole tone is anti-Bu. Just a tiny bit from us,” he wrote. Page texted she had seen the article. “Makes me feel WAY less bad about throwing him under the bus to the forthcoming CF article,” she texted. Congressional investigators are still trying to determine what the “CF article” reference means and who the agents thought they were trying to throw “under the bus.” Republicans want to interview Page to determine if she assisted with any “forthcoming” articles or helped another FBI employee “give” information to the news media, particularly because she helped advise then-deputy director McCabe. Likewise, congressional investigators want to question Strzok about what he meant about the “tiny bit from us” reference. The two agents also spent extensive time shortly before the 2016 election trying to track down information — including an address and a spouse’s job — about The New York Times reporter Matt Apuzzo, who has reported on numerous developments in the Russia case. “We got a list of kids with their parents’ names. How many Matt Apuzzo’s (sic) could there be in DC,” Page texted. “Showed J a picture, he said he thinks he has seen a guy who kinda looks like that, but always really schlubby. I said that sounds like every reporter I have ever seen.” A minute later, Page added another text: “Found what I think might be their address, too.” Strzok writes back, “He’s TOTALLY schlubby. Don’t you remember?” Page responded later by saying she found information on the reporter’s wife too. “Found address looking for her. Lawyer.” Strzok cautions Page against using the work phone to track down information on the reporter. “I wouldn’t search on your work phone, ,,, no idea what that might trigger,” he texted. “Oops. Too late,” she responded back. Apuzzo declined comment when contacted on his cell phone. The two agents exchanged numerous texts sharing links or information about stories in the Russia case, including one shortly before Election Day in which then-Senate Minority Leader Harry ReidHarry Mason ReidJustice Breyer issues warning on remaking Supreme Court: 'What goes around comes around' Manchin, Sanders set for clash over Biden spending package Harry Reid renews call for filibuster to be abolished: 'We need to get the Senate working again' MORE (D-Nev.) expressed concerns there was evidence Trump associates had contacts with Russian figures. When the two shared a National Public Radio article on the opening of Trump’s new hotel in Washington, the two could barely contain their disdain. “That’s one place I hope I never stay in,” Page wrote. Strzok replied. “Agreed. I hope it fails horribly.” Occasionally the two also opined about the media in general. Strzok, for instance, called a New York Post article about agents unhappy with the outcome of the Clinton email case “stupid,” and referred to Fox anchor Chris Wallace as a “turd.” After one of the presidential debates, Strzok also had an observation about then-Fox anchor and current NBC anchor Megyn Kelly. “Vaguely satisfying to see Megyn Kelly (who had Botox and looks HORRIBLE) utterly going after Trump,” he texted.

Trump has repeatedly refused to acknowledge his loss to Biden and has falsely claimed that the election outcome was marred by widespread voter fraud and systemic irregularities.ADVERTISEMENTBut the recount in Georgia — the state’s second in a matter of weeks — confirmed once again that Biden beat Trump by roughly 12,000 votes, making him the first Democratic presidential candidate in nearly three decades to carry the traditionally Republican-leaning state.The recertification of the election results came on the same day that a federal judge tossed out a lawsuit filed by conservative attorney Sydney Powell that sought to overturn Biden’s victory in Georgia. Raffensperger touted the dismissal and the vote certification as win, saying in a statement that his state could now move past the election drama.“Today is an important day for election integrity in Georgia and across the country,” Raffensperger said. “The claims in the Kraken lawsuit prove to be as mythological as the creature for which they’re named. Georgians can now move forward knowing that their votes, and only their legal votes, were counted accurately, fairly, and reliably.”Raffensperger, who has forcefully defended the integrity of the presidential election in Georgia, reiterated on Monday that while state investigators are still looking into some allegations of illegal voting, there is no evidence of widespread fraud or malfeasance.To suggest otherwise, he said, is harmful to the state of Georgia.ADVERTISEMENT“All this talk of a stolen election, whether it’s Stacey Abrams or the president of the United States, is hurting our state,” Raffensperger said at the news conference, referring to the former Democratic gubernatorial candidate who did not concede the 2018 governor’s race to Gov.

The Electoral College is scheduled to meet on Dec. 14 to formally choose Biden as the next president.Despite the coming deadline, Trump has continued his push to overturn the election results. On Friday, his campaign filed a challenge to the election in Georgia, asking a state court to vacate the certification of the presidential election results and order a new vote in the state.Trump also called Kemp on Saturday to demand that he call a special session of the Georgia General Assembly in an effort to overturn the election results. Kemp rebuffed the president’s demand, saying in a joint statement with Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan (R) on Monday that using the legislature to override the state’s election processes would violate the law.“Any attempt by the legislature to retroactively change that process for the November 3rd election would be unconstitutional and immediately enjoined by the courts, resulting in a long legal dispute and no short-term resolution,” Kemp and Duncan said.“The judicial system remains the only viable – and quickest – option in disputing the results of the November 3rd election in Georgia.” Updated: 2:56 p.m. View the discussion thread.

        "articles": "© 1998-2021 Nexstar Media Inc. All Rights Reserved Over the past several months, I’ve watched, read and heard much about the potential Armageddon facing the profession of journalism. I’ve watched colleagues proclaim that “fake news” attacks by President TrumpDonald TrumpCapitol Police recommend disciplinary action for six officers in Jan. 6 internal probe Biden defends Afghanistan withdrawal on 9/11 Will the US emulate China's tech takedown? MORE, crowd chants of “enemies” and the expulsion of CNN’s Jim Acosta from the White House press room pose the greatest threats to news reporting in history. I respectfully disagree. To be fair, there are many dangers I recognize and many fears I see as justified. Forty-five members of the news media have died in the line of duty this year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The death of Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of a Saudi government seeking to silence his voice is as horrific as it is unconscionable. The mail bombs sent to media outlets also are reprehensible and chilling. But journalism, sadly, has laid to rest many a brave reporter, here and on foreign soil, and it managed to keep a neutral light of disclosure burning bright in far more difficult times than today. We journalists have more freedom, more reach, and more ability to inform today than ever before. But with those advantages comes an even greater responsibility to the public, one I fear is being denigrated by journalists who substitute opinion for facts and emotion for dispassion. Beyond the killings, the threats, and the vitriol, what most threatens journalism today is the behavior of its own practitioners. We have become too full of our own opinions, too enthralled with our own celebrity, too emotionally offended by warranted and unwarranted criticism, and too astray from the neutral, factual voice our teachers in journalism school insisted we practice. It was that neutral voice that compelled Americans to welcome television newscasters Walter Cronkite or Peter Jennings into their living rooms each night. It was that commitment to factual reporting without slant that made the morning and evening newspapers mandatory reading. And it was that relentless but emotionally detached commitment to truth, context and fairness — even when enemies sought to discredit us — that exposed such wrongs as Watergate, the Tuskegee experiments and the deplorable treatments at Walter Reed Hospital. The traits that have made journalism great and respected and impactful for most of the past century are sorely lacking in many of today’s practitioners. Instead of facts, many journalists today trade in supposition and opinion. Instead of dispassionate neutral coverage, many have offered emotional rants that border on disrespect. Instead of covering all sides of the story, entire news organizations have chosen to pick one side over another. And Donald Trump’s broadsides have only forced reporters to hunker down even more with these harmful practices. This self-destructive behavior was on full display this week as professional journalists strayed far from their neutral voice in reporting on — and simultaneously condemning — Trump’s statement on why he chose to maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia despite its role in murdering the journalist Khashoggi. Fox News anchor Shepard Smith declared: “President Trump stands with Saudi Arabia. Today the president insulted the murder victim and sided with the Saudis, who said our CIA is wrong.” On CNN, anchor Brianna Keilar suggested there was little difference in Trump’s annual rite of pardoning a Thanksgiving turkey and his treatment of Saudi Arabia. “And there you have it — President Trump pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey, the annual tradition. Peas is the name of this turkey,” Keilar said on “CNN Newsroom.” “And just the most unusual dichotomy here, as this comes on the heels of a statement that the president has put out essentially pardoning Saudi Arabia and the crown prince and the king there, despite what his intel community is expected to put out in a report today that Saudi Arabia is behind, that these leaders of Saudi Arabia are behind the killing of a Washington Post journalist,” she added. Such rhetorical flair may make the journalist emotionally satisfied for a moment. But the injection of opinion and insinuation and condemnation disserves the public for a far longer time, depriving viewers and readers of a neutral set of facts upon which to make their own decisions and opinions. With rare exception, the wise elders of the profession have not spoken up forcefully enough to denounce this creeping cancer of POV journalism, nor stem the demise of the profession’s core values of fairness, accuracy, precision and neutrality. In fact, some are gleefully cheering on some of the bad-boy behaviors. Bob Woodward, my former colleague at The Washington Post, is one of the rare voices of consternation. He quickly recognized that President Trump’s double-down battle with the media risked evoking emotional responses from a profession that requires neutrality under fire. His wise assessment of the Acosta dispute hearkened to the golden values of the journalism era just past. If you are angry as a journalist, he suggested, don’t sue, opinionate or denigrate. Instead, strap on a camera or a notebook and break some meaningful news that illuminates what is wrong without tainting it with the soapbox. I can put it another way, in the words of my first real mentor in journalism, George Reedy. He used to say, “You don’t use a bullhorn filled with opinion and emotion when a flashlight’s illumination of facts will do.” Show dignity and neutrality as a journalist in the face of adversity, and ditch the swagger and attitude, he preached. My old Irish aunt once admonished me in a slightly different, but equally effective, way. She used to say, “If you want to have people listen to your opinion, become a politician. Otherwise, just stick to some damn facts, Mr. Reporter.” John Solomon is an award-winning investigative journalist whose work over the years has exposed U.S. and FBI intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, federal scientists’ misuse of foster children and veterans in drug experiments, and numerous cases of political corruption.

Obama’s approval ratings are in the basement and show no signs of improving, so Democrats are keeping their distance. On the stump, in campaign ads and at fundraisers, Obama’s absence is increasingly conspicuous. Democrats are voicing their displeasure with his policies and campaign advisers are telling candidates to avoid being photographed with him, so as to deny Republicans effective visuals for campaign ads. “It’s a no-brainer,” said one operative who works for a senator up for reelection in 2014. “The second term has been a bit of a disaster, his approval ratings are the lowest of his presidency and Washington is in disarray.” Many of the Democratic senators elected in 2008 rode to office on Obama’s coattails. Six years later, they’re asking, “Barack who?” Sen. Mark UdallMark Emery UdallKennedy apologizes for calling Haaland a 'whack job' OVERNIGHT ENERGY: Haaland courts moderates during tense confirmation hearing | GOP's Westerman looks to take on Democrats on climate change | White House urges passage of House public lands package Udalls: Haaland criticism motivated 'by something other than her record' MORE (D-Colo.) last week avoided being at his own fundraiser while Obama was there, excusing himself on the grounds that he had to attend votes at the Capitol. It is not just Senate Democrats who are displeased with the president. Some House members have expressed dissent over his approach to the surge of young illegal immigrants streaming across the southern border. Last week, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) described Obama’s behavior over the border crisis as “aloof,” “detached” and “bizarre.” Referring to a staged photo opportunity for news media when Obama drank beer and played pool in Colorado while thousands of Latino children crossed the southern border illegally, Cuellar added, “I mean, the optics are just horrible.” The centrist Texas congressman was not the only critic. Liberal Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) told MSNBC that “the borderlands deserve a presidential visit.” He added, “I think a visit by the president is reaffirming that the borderlands along the southwest border are vital and important to this nation. So I think a visit would be important and very symbolic.” Many Democrats in Congress complain that Obama is indifferent to their concerns. There is also a broader sense on Capitol Hill that Obama just isn’t the guy they thought he was, who would deliver on his vaunted promises of hope and change. “He’s not the most popular man these days,” one senior Senate Democratic aide said. “A lot of people think it’s been one disappointment after the next and he can’t really get his bearings.” Political observers say the White House understands the need for some Democrats to distance themselves from Obama. That is especially true in Senate contests where Democrats are seeking reelection in conservative states. “They understand that President Obama is not the best messenger in all of these races,” said Christy Setzer, a Democratic strategist. “The White House understands this is about ... doing whatever it takes to save the Senate. In some places, that’s going to mean the president goes out and does events and, in other places, he takes a more behind the scenes role.” Jamal Simmons, another Democratic strategist, added that Democrats such as Cuellar “have to do what’s best for themselves. “It’s probably not making the White House happy, but he’s doing what he needs to do back home.” Obama knows he’s radioactive but that hasn’t hurt his fundraising. Democrats love his prowess filling their campaign war chests. They just don’t want to be seen publicly embracing him. If Republicans wrest control of the Senate from the Democrats, it will be seen as a repudiation of Obama. Setzer suggested that Democrats in competitive races should try to fight not on national politics but on a record of local achievement. “I think what you’re going to see is a lot of people following the Thad CochranWilliam (Thad) Thad CochranBottom line Bottom line Alabama zeroes in on Richard Shelby's future MORE strategy: Talk about how you’ve been delivering for your state,” she said, referring to the Mississippi GOP senator who recently defeated a Tea Party challenger. The latest Gallup daily tracking poll shows that Obama has a 42 percent approval rating, about the lowest of his presidency. His pariah status contrasts starkly with that of two power brokers who are feeling the love from Democratic candidates: Bill and Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonSchumer remembers 9/11: 'Oh my God, this is World War III' Bidens, former presidents mark 9/11 anniversary Why is Biden hesitating to challenge China as East Asia's major trade partner? MORE. Several campaigns have already expressed an informal interest in having one of the Clintons appear alongside them on the stump. Obama sought to poke fun at the awkward situation during an appearance at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in May. “Of course now that it’s 2014, Washington is obsessed on the midterms,” the president said. “Folks are saying that with my sagging poll numbers, my fellow Democrats don’t really want me campaigning with them. And I don’t think that’s true — although I did notice the other day that Sasha needed a speaker at career day, and she invited Bill ClintonWilliam (Bill) Jefferson ClintonBidens, former presidents mark 9/11 anniversary Harris to hold fundraiser for McAuliffe ahead of Virginia governor's race Huckabee Sanders invokes Mike Huckabee, Bill Clinton in first television ad MORE.” The president, with no more campaigns to run himself and pushed aside as a proxy, has no forum in which to display his strengths as a campaigner. “A lot of these candidates who are in tight races are just in a place where they’re just running on their own things,” said one senior Senate Democrat. “It’s so commonplace, and he’s so unpopular, that people don’t even talk about it anymore.” But Setzer said what Obama is experiencing is common for this place and time, nearly halfway through a president’s second term. “We see this with every president and it’s not surprising,” Setzer said. Still, even candidates in places where Obama could help are keeping a safe distance, choosing to stay away from the president’s policies while focusing on their own. “We’re focused on putting our candidate out front and center,” an adviser to a 2014 Senate candidate said. “Not the national figures.” View the discussion thread.

All Rights Reserved Republican Ed Gillespie is now narrowly leading the Virginia gubernatorial race by 3 points, according to a new poll, just three days before Tuesday's election. The new poll of likely Virginia voters by Republican firm Optimus/Firehouse Strategies over Wednesday and Thursday shows Gillespie leading his Democratic opponent Ralph Northam by 40.4 percent to 37.4 percent. His lead is just outside the poll's margin of error. Recent polls have suggested a late-game comeback for Gillespie, who trailed Northam by a small margin for recent months of the race, with a Friday poll showing the two locked in a dead heat at 47 percent apiece. However, Northam is predicted to win by a 1.5 point margin if voter turnout mirrors 2016 levels, the poll said, citing \"volatile\" party composition. The poll used a model based on 2013 voter turnout to predict a Gillespie win. An average of major polls still shows Northam with a slight lead of 1.2 points, which marks a steep decline over recent weeks from averages favoring the Democrat by over 3 points.

All Rights Reserved For the first time since he launched his presidential bid, Jeb Bush’s net favorability among Republicans is negative, according to a new Gallup survey released on Friday. Once considered the GOP's front-runner, the former Florida governor’s plus-27 favorability rating in mid-July has now declined to a minus-1 less than a month before the Iowa caucuses. While his favorable rating has declined from 54 percent to 44 percent in the six-month span, his unfavorable rating has ballooned, from 27 to 45 percent. Bush has been hit the hardest by a 39-point decline in support among Republican men, the poll found. While conservative males once viewed Bush favorably by a plus-30 margin, the group now views him unfavorably by a minus-9 spread. Bush’s minus-1 rating is also good for last place in the Republican primary field. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is seen as the most favorable candidate, with a net favorability rating of plus-45, followed by Ben Carson at plus-40, and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) at plus-35.

He is the only candidate within 10 points of Bush’s unfavorable rating, with 35 percent of Republicans viewing him negatively. Republican voters’ unfavorable impression of Bush has also been reflected in national polls. According to a RealClearPolitics average poll, Bush has just 3.3 percent support nationwide in the GOP primary. The Gallup poll is an accumulation of telephone surveys conducted between July 8 and Jan. 5. The survey polled 44,111 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents over that timeframe and has a margin of error of 4 percent. View the discussion thread.
