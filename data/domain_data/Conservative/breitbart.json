        "articles": "Day Three: As authorities continue their investigation, it is clear beyond any reasonable doubt that the San Bernardino attack was an act of radical Islamic terror. Many Democrats and much of the media are still treating it as a “gun violence” incident, and are using the attack as an effort to push gun control laws–and to demonize those who view the event, and the consequences, differently. As San Bernardino mourns, the members of the San Bernardino Police Department are emerging as heroes for solving the crime quickly, and preventing the further attacks that the terrorists clearly had planned. 4:50 p.m.: However, the question of an Islamic caliphate didn’t get so much distance:  4:49 p.m.: Raheem Kassam corners the mosque’s representatives on death sentences for ex-Muslim apostates. 4:26 p.m.: The leaders of the San Bernardino mosque that played host to terrorist shooter Syed Farook refused to answer as to whether the FBI is investigating other mosque attendees, repeatedly stating “no comment.” 3:59 p.m.: Glass ceiling. Video by Raheem Kassam: 3:02 p.m.: Tashfeen Malik: BREAKING: First photo of #SanBernardino terror suspect Tashfeen Malik obtained by @ABC:  pic.twitter.com/hV9Qi8eiPk — ABC News (@ABC) December 4, 2015 Malik, who was born in Pakistan, moved to Saudi Arabia 25 years ago when she was about four years old. When she was older, she likely moved back and forth between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, according to a source close to the Saudi Arabian government. In 2007, she returned to Pakistan to study at Bahuddin Zakri University in Multan and stayed until 2012, according to a Pakistani intelligence official. She was said to be a brilliant student and was not known to have religious or political affiliation while there. … Malik came to the U.S. on what is known as a “fiancé” visa, which allows an American fiancé to petition for his or her partner’s temporary entry before marriage. For the visa application, the address she listed in her Pakistani hometown, ABC News discovered today, does not exist. Malik received a her Green Card this summer, U.S. officials said. 1:24 p.m.: Raheem Kassam’s video report on the journalists at the apartment: 12:15 p.m.: CNN analyst Harry Houck has reiterated his earlier shock that the media were allowed to rummage through the apartment. He tells Brooke Baldwin: “I can’t believe the FBI can make a mistake like this. I really don’t.” 11:35 a.m.:  News’ Michelle Moons and Raheem Kassam are on the scene, investigating whether journalists actually had permission to storm the apartment. The FBI seems not to care. Local police are not yet commenting. Permission was, at best, unclear. Moons and Kassam found the crowbar that was used to force open the entrance to the apartment. Suspects’ home with crowbar (Michelle Moons /  News) 11:30 a.m.: The FBI has announced that the San Bernardino killings are officially an act of terrorism. It has also confirmed that Malik posted a pledge of allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to Facebook as the attack was being carried out. 10:20 a.m.: The Council on American-Islamic Relations is blaming the United States for the radical Islamist terror attack in San Bernardino. Apparently, U.S. policies cause Muslims to snap.  News’ Jordan Schachtel reports: The United States is “partially” responsible for a jihadi massacre on Wednesday in San Bernardino, California, carried out by Islamic State loyalists who killed 14 and wounding dozens more, Hussam Ayloush, the Los Angeles Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said Friday… “When we support coup leaders in Egypt or other places, when we supports dictatorship, oppressive regimes around the world that push people over on the edge, then they become extremists, then they become terrorists. We are partly responsible,” he added. This is almost like issuing demands on behalf of a terrorist organization. Change policies, or else. 10:15 a.m.: The media continue rummaging around in the apartment, getting their fingerprints on everything, moving objects around. And–who knows? planting evidence. It appears the media did not have clearance from local police to do what they are doing right now.  News’ John Nolte has more. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s spokesperson Deputy Olivia Bozek tells Grasswire apartment is still a crime scene, was not cleared. — Matthew Keys (@MatthewKeysLive) December 4, 2015 3. It could include evidence of accomplices, networks, future attacks. People may die because of this media madness.  — Joel Pollak (@joelpollak) December 4, 2015 A contrary view: The apt was a tertiary crime scene. Processed, bagged, and sealed up. People are hysterical over nothing. — John Cardillo (@johncardillo) December 4, 2015 9:50 a.m.: MSNBC and CNN have gained access to the suspects’ home, apparently thanks to a neighbor with a crowbar. Amazingly, they are now rummaging around in their personal belongings, holding up ID cars and stuffed animals (and Qurans) for the cameras. Somehow law enforcement did not protect the premises and has not taken custody of evidence that could be extremely important for intelligence about future terror attacks or criminal investigations. @HowardKurtz they used a crowbar to get in pic.twitter.com/PlN9ywyUzz — Greg Pollowitz (@GPollowitz) December 4, 2015 Two Korans among the IDs on the bed. pic.twitter.com/liPtzXSJbf — John Nolte (@NolteNC) December 4, 2015 8:10 a.m.: Tashfeen Malik, the female attacker, pledged allegiance to ISIS on social media, CNN and the New York Times both report. From the Times: WASHINGTON — The woman who helped carry out the shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., on Wednesday had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in a Facebook posting, according to federal law enforcement officials. There’s no evidence the group directed the woman, Tashfeen Malik, and her husband Syed Rizwan Farook, to launch the attacks, which killed 14 and wounded 21, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. “At this point we believe they were more self-radicalized and inspired by the group than actually told to do the shooting,” one of the officials said. The posting had been removed from the social media site and it’s not clear when federal authorities obtained it. On Wednesday, the day of the attack, President Barack Obama assured Americans that there was no threat from ISIS. The interview aired Thursday, after evidence of terrorist links had long since emerged–and while Obama continued to insist “workplace violence” was a possible explanation. 5:20 a.m.: New details of the 14 dead are emerging, and there are some heartbreaking ironies, as well as stories of heroism and courage. For example, Bennetta Betbadal, 46, was a Catholic who fled Islamic extremism in Iran, only to be killed by an Islamic extremist in the United States. Her family has set up a GoFundMe page. While Governor Jerry Brown has struck a statesmanlike tone throughout, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) is vowing not to stand for moments of silence, following the left’s line that thoughts and prayers are not enough, and only conformity with the gun control agenda will suffice as an acceptable reaction to events. Meanwhile, Syed Rizwan Farook’s sister Saira Khan has expressed her sense of shock to CBS News: “I can never imagine my brother or my sister-in-law doing something like this. Especially because they were happily married, they had a beautiful 6-month-old daughter. It’s just mind boggling why they would do something like this.” A colleague endorses the idea that Farook was radicalized by his wife, and not the other way around: Christian Nwadike was shocked when he learned the man accused of gunning down over a dozen people turned out to be the coworker he sat only feet from for nearly four years. He said Farook was different after he returned from Saudi Arabia. “Do you believe that he was radicalized?” Begnaud asked him. “Yes, by the wife, I think he married a terrorist,” Nwadike said. “He married a terrorist?” “Yes, he was set up through that marriage,” Nwadike responded. Day Two: Authorities are still investigating details of a mass shooting Wednesday morning in San Bernardino, California at the Inland Regional Center, a facility for developmentally disabled adults. 14 people were killed and at least 17 injured in a conference room at the center, where county employees had been enjoying a holiday party. There appear to be two suspects, both Muslim, a husband-and-wife team named Syed Rezwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27. Large portions of the city remain locked down. 9:25 p.m.: The community has held a vigil for the victims at San Manuel Stadium. It has been an incredibly difficult 36 hours, and lives will never be the same–neither in San Bernardino, nor perhaps in the country itself. We leave with the shock of knowing that a quiet neighbor could be a deadly terrorist. We mourn a political debate that sought every enemy–even prayer–before facing the reality of evil. But we will remember the heroism of those who arrived to help, and those who helped each other. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) 6:40 p.m.: Catherine Herridge of Fox News reports that the use of pipe bombs strapped to premote-controlled cars is an Al Qaeda “signature” design that is “borrowed by ISIS,” and which has been propagated globally the Islamist magazine Inspire. 6:30 p.m.: Mia Bloom of Georgia State University floats the theory on Fox News’ Kelly File that Malik may have radicalized her husband, rather than the other way around. No one has yet published an image of Malik–except the aerial shot of her dead body. San Bernardino Shooting – SUV (Imgur) 6:15 p.m.: As reminder of how bizarre this story is, and of the sheer diversity of views and lifestyles in the Muslim community: the lead terrorist’s brother is a Navy veteran decorated for his service in the Global War on Terror, the Daily Mail reports. 6:05 p.m.: Lt. Madden is asked to respond to public criticism of the police–i.e. #BlackLivesMatter. “You know, we’ve taken a lot of hits lately. Some justified, some of it unjustified…There are cops who go astray. But overwhelmingly, the vast majority of officers…do the job to protect the public.” 5:55 p.m.: Lt. Mike Madden of the San Bernardino Police Department, one of the first to arrive on the scene, describes his experience on Wednesday. His voice trembling, he describes the “unspeakable” scene; the panic on the faces of people so terrified they did not want to follow the police out; the “moans and the wails” along with fire alarms; the fresh smell of gunpowder in the air, suggesting more shooters present; the surreal job for which he had trained but for which no one, he says, can be prepared. First responder cop: “It was unspeakable, the carnage that we were seeing” #sanbernardino — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 4, 2015 Cop: “When we entered there was fresh gunpowder and the smell of gunpowder in the air” #sanbernardino — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 4, 2015 Cop: “I noticed upon entry there was a Christmas Tree in [the room]” #sanbernardino. — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 4, 2015 Cop: “there are so many families going into this holiday season that are now going to have to deal with this tragedy” #sanbernardino — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 4, 2015 In any age, the performance of the San Bernardino authorities would have been heroic. In an age of constant criticism of the police, it is something more than that–a kind of restoration, for the nation as a whole, of the ideals of service and leadership. 5:50 p.m.: Gov. Jerry Brown addresses a press conference in San Bernadino with law enforcement officials. “This is a really sad day,” he says. His remarks are focused on public safety and vigilance. Gov Gerry Brown: “We have to be on our guard” #SanBernardino pic.twitter.com/kTtBzX5Y0w — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) December 4, 2015 5:45 p.m.: The New York Times notes that Farook and Malik both shared a Pakistani background, though he was born in Illinois and raised in California. They led quiet lifestyles and apparently fooled their own relatives thoroughly about their intentions. Syed Farook (DMV) 5:40 p.m.: Farook’s apparent online dating pitch, via  News’ Neil Munro, emphasized his simple, pious lifestyle: Assalaamu Alaikum, I was born and raised in the US (mostly in California). I have a pretty simply lifestyle. I spend much of my free time in the masjid. memorizing the quran and learning more about the religion. In my free time, I will work on my project car or workout. I don’t really watch much TV or movies. I really don’t know what else to write.so feel free to ask about all the things that I left out…. I am looking for a practicing muslimah. someone who takes her religion very seriously and is always trying to improve her religion and encouraging others to do the same using hikmah and not harshness. In sha-Allah if her imaan is in the right place then the other small things should not pose that much of a problem. 4:00 p.m.: Los Angeles-area news source KTLA has posted a moving tribute to some of the victims of the San Bernadino shooting, based on information compiled from news articles, social media, and tips from the public. Visit the memorial post here. 3:30 p.m.: Farook had dating profiles at online marriage services, including a website called dubaimatrimonial.com, the Washington Post reports: Syed Rizwan Farook was looking for a wife. On at least two online sites, he posted details for prospective brides. “Religious but modern,” he apparently wrote on one. He made a point of noting his American citizenship on another…. On another matchmaker site, Dubaimatrimonial.com, a person believed to be Farook described himself as having family roots in Karachi, noting he was born in Chicago and was residing in Los Angeles as an American citizen. 3:15 p.m.: Hillary Clinton has finally come around to admitting that the shooting is likely a terrorist attack: Hillary Clinton, in New Hampshire, on #SanBernardino shooting: “It’s becoming clearer that we’re dealing with an act of terrorism.” — Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) December 3, 2015 2:00 p.m.: At least one of the wounded victims in the attack is a Muslim woman who attends a mosque Farook used to attend. The Los Angeles Times reports: One of the victims in the shooting also was a member of the congregation. She is a social worker based in the same center as Farook. She suffered multiple gunshot wounds during the attack, but is recovering and is not in critical condition, [Mustafa] Kuko [director of the Islamic Center of Riverside] said. 1:50 p.m.: The photograph news agencies are now using of Farook is the following: Syed Rezwan Farook (News Agencies) 1:45 p.m.: Another victim was Daniel Kaufman, 42, who is survived by his boyfriend, Ryan Reyes, 32. The Los Angeles Times reports: The last message from Kaufman arrived at 10:37 a.m. — a picture of a friend he had met at a comic book conference. About an hour later, Reyes received a text from his sister: “Hey Ry does Daniel work at the Regional Center in Sb? Check the news.” Reyes, 32, called his boyfriend repeatedly but kept getting sent to voicemail. “Call me ASAP!” he texted. There was no reply. The next 22 hours were a slow torture, as Reyes and his family received conflicting reports about his boyfriend’s fate. 1:17 p.m.: The first victim to be identified is Nicholas Thalasinos, a middle-aged man. He is apparently a Messianic Jew, i.e. a man identifying as a Jew but believing in Jesus Christ. His Facebook profile identifies him as a supporter of Israel and a fan of Rush Limbaugh. Nicholas Thalasinos (Facebook) A New York Post profile reports that Thalasinos had anti-Muslim views: One of the victims of the San Bernardino massacre was a Messianic Jew who filled his Facebook page with condemnations of Muslims and impassioned screeds against jihadist terror… Under “Education,” Thalasinos listed on Facebook, “Studied Conservatism at Limbaugh Institute of Advanced Conservative Studies.” It is inevitable that journalists will begin to ask whether those views–and Limbaugh–triggered Farook to undertake his rampage against fellow county employees. 12:25 p.m.: Inland Regional Center San Bernardino (Raheem Kassam /  News) 12:00 p.m.:  London Editor-in-Chief Raheem Kassam is in San Bernadino and says that police investigators have set up special cameras to map the scene of the final showdown: Police now deploying what one officer called “fancy cameras” which are little white orbs that 3D map the whole street. They are on small tripods and are being placed 10-15ft away from each other up the street. 11:41 a.m.: Democrats continue to make gun control the focus of their response to the terror attack in San Bernadino. The White House is calling for a new assault weapons ban, Charlie Spiering notes. Presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is calling for “universal background checks,” Patrick Howley reports. And Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is even claiming that there is a “terrorist loophole” in gun laws that Republicans won’t close, as Caroline May reports. But as AWR Hawkins notes, California already has these regulations in place, and could not prevent the shooting. California has expanded background checks, which means they require a background check on every sale–retail or private. These are the very checks that President Obama, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Democrat surrogates like Gabby Giffords, Mark Kelly, Shannon Watts, and others are pushing at the federal level on the false premise of keeping Americans safe. They are the same checks that Colorado enacted after the heinous December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary, under the illusion that such checks would prevent a high profile public attack. 11:35 a.m.: On Sep. 11, 2001, Democrats and Republicans stood together on the Capitol steps and sang “God Bless America.” We don’t deal with national emergencies the same way anymore. As  News’ National Security team points out, the two parties continue to interpret events very differently, 24 hours after the San Bernardino attacks–even as the so-called Islamic State threatens New York and Moscow with future terror attacks. Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson told the Republican Jewish Coalition presidential candidate forum Wednesday that the U.S. faced a “class of civilizations” at home and abroad: He discussed his recent trip to Syrian refugee camps, advocating for the creation of “safe havens” in the Middle East, but not for the refugees’ import to the United States. Secondly, “we are currently facing a clash of civilizations” between radical Islam and western values, he said, explaining that Israel is America’s ally in this coming battle. Meanwhile, Democrats are calling for gun control and accusing Republicans of bigotry. Three U.S. Representatives are heading to a D.C.-area mosque where al Qaeda’s Anwar al-Awlaki once preached, to show solidarity in the face of alleged “Islamophobia”: Democratic Representatives Rep. Donald Beyer (D-VA), Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), and Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY) announced in a letter: “We must show that we will not tolerate islamophobia and that those who propagate it do not represent the melting-pot America that we celebrate.” 11:22 a.m.: The San Bernardino Police Officers Association has posted a message on the Facebook page of the San Bernardino City Fire Department: In the aftermath of what was arguably the worst day, during the darkest period of our community we witnessed the men and women of the SBPD rise to a level few communities (fortunately) have personally witnessed. The professionalism, dedication, compassion and training gelled when it was needed and the horror was confined and put down. I am very proud to be a member of this organization and to work closely with so many brave men and women. Read it in full here. 11:05 a.m.: The New York Times reports that the FBI has designated this case as terrorism: The F.B.I. is treating its inquiry into the massacre here as a counter-terrorism investigation, two law enforcement officials said Thursday, based on materials the suspects stockpiled — including explosives — their Middle East travels and evidence that one of them had been in touch with people with Islamist extremist views, both in the United States and abroad. 10:35 a.m.: The New York Post confirms reporting by CNN that Farook is thought to have communicated with people who are the subject of independent terror investigations.  News’ John Hayward reports that police found a dozen pipe bombs at the suspect’s apartment. 10:25 a.m.: CBS News reports that the suspects had looked at ISIS propaganda online. JUST IN: #SanBernardino suspects were looking at ISIS propaganda online, source tells CBS News  — CBS News (@CBSNews) December 3, 2015 It was just eight days ago that President Barack Obama reassured the nation that there was no imminent threat of terror attacks from ISIS. 10:22 a.m.: The San Bernardino police chief praised the heroism of his officers, who led terrified survivors out of the building and were able to track and stop the killers before they could strike again. The police also cooperated with the local FBI branch, which was called in to help dispose of booby traps at the Redlands home of one of the subjects. In a somewhat humorous twist, the man whom police chased Wednesday evening turned out not to be a terrorist, but was booked anyway on a misdemeanor warrant. 10:15 a.m.: At the press conference, the FBI says it is not yet ready to conclude that the attacks were international terrorism. However, officials confirmed that Farook had traveled abroad extensively in 2014, including Pakistan. Malik had entered the country on a K-1 visa, which is a nonimmigrant visa for people engaged to U.S. citizens, and traveled on a Pakistani passport. 9:55 a.m.: At a press conference in San Bernardino, police rule appear to rule out workplace violence as a motive. They confirm that the guns were purchased legally, though only the handguns were purchased by Farook. The vehicle used was rented through yesterday, and therefore had Utah license plates. Law enforcement will release the names of the victims throughout the day. 9:50 a.m.: NBC News is reporting that the suspects left a remote-controlled bomb on the scene of the holiday party, similar to that used by the Tsarnaev brothers in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. The aim was to kill police and medical personnel. The devices apparently malfunctioned. The attackers who killed 14 at a California office party Wednesday left behind a remote-controlled explosive device as they raced away in a black SUV with the bomb controller in their hands, NBC News has learned. Multiple federal and regional sources familiar with the investigation of the attack at San Bernardino’s Inland Regional Center told NBC News that the controller was similar to the model car controller used in the Boston Marathon bombing of 2013. Authorities said the design indicated that the attackers appeared to have calculated that their initial attack would draw a heavy law enforcement and emergency personnel response and left behind a device that would cause still greater casualties. The device did not explode, and investigators do not know if the controller was too far away to trigger the bomb. Forensic investigation of the device has not been completed. 9:45 a.m.: Focus is shifting–slowly–to the victims and their families. The descriptions of the shootings are horrific, with people gunned down and shot while they hid beneath desks at was supposed to have been a festive holiday party. One victim whose name has been released, Denise Peraza, talked to her sister during the attack. She was wounded in the lower back and is recovering at Arrowhead Medical Center.  News’ National Security editor, Frances Martel has her story, and that of other victims. In addition to the five victims being treated at Arrowhead, five are being treated at Loma Linda University Medical Center, according to the Associated Press. Praise is being heard all around for the responses of area hospitals, as well as for the San Bernardino Police Department, which reportedly arrived on the scene of the shooting a mere four minutes after it began. 9:20 a.m.: It’s terrorism, says CNN. CNN BREAKING: Farook was in touch with more than one international terrorism subjects –@evanperez — Vaughn Sterling (@vplus) December 3, 2015 9:15 a.m.: Brian Ross of ABC News has coined a new term for the attack: “hybrid workplace jihad.” That is not a technical term, as it purports to be, but rather a way of bridging the political distance between what looks increasingly like an Islamic terror attack on the one hand, and President Barack Obama’s dogged insistence that it might be a Muslim couple simply “going postal.” Regarding that couple, there are now questions about the timing of their marriage. Their child–whom they left with relatives–was reportedly born in May, but they were only married earlier this year, reportedly. That raises questions about a premarital liaison–or perhaps about a sham marriage arranged for other reasons, perhaps for a pretext for Malik to be in the country. Still unclear. 8:35 a.m.: Liberal journalists are complaining about the New York Post‘s cover this morning, which bears the heading “Killer Muslims” in late editions. Ironically, some of these complaints come from people who praised the New York Daily News for its “God Isn’t Fixing This” headline, which mocked people (exclusively Republicans, on the cover) for sending prayers to victims. The two Americas: #SanBernardino pic.twitter.com/axPWBJQLr0 — Michael Graham (@IAMMGraham) December 3, 2015 Meanwhile, the Council on American-Islamic Relations is ramping up complaints about “Islamophobia,” using the New York Post as a target–though its headline is 100% factually accurate. #CAIR Islamophobia Watch: NY Post’s Inflammatory ‘Muslim Killers’ Front Page  — CAIR National (@CAIRNational) December 3, 2015 8:25 a.m.: President Barack Obama, addressing the media, has said that we do not know the motive of the San Bernardino killers, that it could be “workplace violence” or terrorism, and that we need to press forward with efforts at gun control, regardless. From  News’ Charlie Spiering: President Barack Obama says that it’s possible yesterday’s attack in California, where two people killed 14 and injured 17 others, was terrorist related. But he’s also holding out the possibility it was workplace violence. “It is possible that this is terrorist-related, but we don’t know; it is also possible this was workplace-related,” Obama said, adding, “we don’t know why they did it. 8:15 a.m.: Fox News is reporting that all of the guns used in the attack were legally purchased. The killers were also armed to the teeth with extra ammunition, pipe bombs, remote-control cars, and “rollout bags,” in an apparent plan for a sustained attack with maximum casualties. The GoPro cameras were mounted on their uniforms–perhaps another piece of evidence linking them to terror, since the footage undoubtedly would have been used in jihadist propaganda. From the Fox News report: A law enforcement source told Fox News that the couple were each carrying an AR-15 rifle and a pistol – all later determined to have been legally purchased – when they were shot and killed by police after a brief chase in their black SUV about 2 miles from the initial shooting site. The source said the vehicle also contained so-called “rollout bags” with multiple pipe bombs, as well as additional ammunition. The couple also had GoPro cameras strapped to their body armor and wore tactical clothing, including vests stuffed with ammunition magazines. “That’s a military tactic for a sustained fight,” the source told Fox News of the rollout bags… In addition to the explosives found at the SUV, authorities discovered and detonated three pipe bombs late Wednesday at the Inland Regional Center, the complex where the initial shooting took place about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. Another source said investigators discovered multiple pipe bombs in the house, as well as small explosives strapped to remote-controlled cars. 7:45 a.m.: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has chosen an odd moment to attack Republicans for criticizing radical Islam. In a conference call Wednesday, which the DNC has been promoting Thursday morning, DNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) blasts Republicans for “demonizing an entire religion.” She also renewed her push for Syrian refugees to be admitted to the country, arguing that Syrian migrants today are like Jews fleeing the Holocaust before World War II: “We have seen this movie before. In May 1939, the SS St. Louis left Hamburg, Germany carrying more than 900 passengers, nearly all of them Jewish and seeking refuge in the United States. Our country turned them away, and many who were sent back to mainland Europe were killed in the Holocaust. Instead of learning from that mistake – Republican candidates and politicians were eager to repeat it,” she said. 6:45 a.m.: A high school in Pacific Palisades, a Los Angeles neighborhood where many Hollywood celebrities live, has received a threat, according to the Palisadian-Post: BREAKING: Parents this evening received notification that Palisades Charter High School is on “high alert” due to an anonymous tip. According to Pali High Principal Pamela Magee, it was Palisades Charter Elementary School that received a threatening call today. “Pali High was notified of the alert and sent out a similar message about being on high alert due to the incident in [San Bernardino],” Magee told the ‪#‎palipost‬. Pali Elementary could not be reached for comment. One parent commented on Facebook: “Having received that call from Palisades Elementary School tonight I can say that while the call itself was disturbing the complete lack of update or follow up made it more so. The call didn’t say do or don’t send kids to school, so I think we have all been left wondering.” 6:40 a.m.: The Telegraph (UK), citing the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), reports that female suspect Tashfeen Malik is originally from Pakistan–not Russia, as some early reports erroneously claimed. The couple had a child believed to have been born in May this year, according to Hussam Ayloush, Council of American Islamic Relation executive director. Farook’s family was originally from South Asia, while Malik was believed to be from Pakistan and had lived in Saudi Arabia before coming to the United States, Mr Ayloush said. 5:45 a.m.: The Los Angeles Times reports that at least two of the four the guns recovered from the suspects were purchased legally. Meredith Davis, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said officials had “successfully traced” the four guns recovered in connection with the San Bernardino shooting and determined that two of the weapons were purchased legally…. Police officials said that two suspects, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, were armed with two assault rifles and two semiautomatic handguns. The assault rifles were a .223-caliber DPMS Model A15 and a Smith and Wesson M&P15. One of the handguns was manufactured by Llama, and the other by Smith and Wesson. It is not clear whether the other two guns were obtained illegally, and, if so, which of the two were illegal. 6:10 a.m.:  California can now report that California Jerry Brown is not canceling plans to attend the Paris climate change conference this week–at least, not yet. 5:30 a.m.: Political correctness may have played a role, as suspicious neighbors declined to report the suspects for fe ar of “racial profiling.” CBS Los Angeles reports: Neighbors in Redlands were shocked that the suspects had ties to their area. “I was in awe that it was happening four houses down form my property,” one neighbor said. A man who has been working in the area said he noticed a half-dozen Middle Eastern men in the area in recent weeks, but decided not to report anything since he did not wish to racially profile those people. “We sat around lunch thinking, ‘What war they doing around the neighborhood?’” he said. “We’d see them leave where they’re raiding the apartment.” 4:45 a.m.: Fox News reports that the suspects’ apartment was a “bomb-making factory,” with improvised explosive devices (IED) and remote-controlled cars for delivering explosives to their targets. The suspects are said to have attacked the holiday party wearing body armor and GoPro cameras to record their exploits. The couple had apparently left their young daughter with a grandparent, saying they had a doctor’s appointment to attend. The Inland Regional Center is now a crime scene, with victims’ bodies still apparently inside. Police have not yet released identifying details about the dead or wounded. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) Day One San Bernardino law enforcement authorities report a mass shooting involving at least 20 victims just before 11 a.m. Pacific time.

FBI has not weighed in yet and, while law enforcement is open to labeling the attack terrorism, they have not yet settled on a motive:               10:10 p.m.: Police press conference is underway. Second suspect identified:   9:32 p.m.: Lost in the shuffle earlier: a shocking claim that, if true, is extremely damning for political correctness:  9:27 p.m.: No argument at the party?  9:10 p.m.: CNN reports that Farook “abruptly left” the holiday event for county employees, according to several sources. 8:58 p.m.: At the CAIR press conference, Syed Farook’s brother-in-law Farhan Khan is present and delivers a statement. “I have no idea why he would he do something like this. I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself.” Khan does not answer questions from reporters. Executive Director of CAIR-LA says “We unequivocally condemn the horrific act that happened today.” 8:44 p.m.: A colleague says Syed Farook’s employer had recently held a baby shower for him. 8:42 p.m.: The husband of an wounded shooting victim gives her chilling account: The shooters who opened fire in a conference room at a California center for the developmentally disabled Wednesday didn’t say anything before they started spraying the room with bullets, the husband of a woman who was shot but survived said. Salaheen Kondoker’s wife, Annie, an environmental engineer who works for San Bernardino County, was inside the conference room when gunfire erupted at around 11 a.m. local time. “They just started shooting … they didn’t yell or say anything beforehand,” Salaheen Kondoker said his wife told him. 8:37 p.m.: From the Wall Street Journal: “Government records show Mr. Farook, a U.S. citizen, traveled to Saudi Arabia last year.” 8:22 p.m.: Photos from Raheem Kassam: This is the bag with a camouflage pattern that police and the bomb disposal robot cleared on the street. It contained books, toiletries, and men’s clothes. A police barrier on Richardson Street. 8:16 p.m.: From Jordan Schachtel: CAIR is preparing a press conference for 8:30 PM in Anaheim, California. Just an hour before Wednesday’s shooting in San Bernardino, CAIR was demanding the FBI get involved in an alleged desecration of a Quran: The Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) today called on the FBI to investigate as a hate crime an incident in which an apparently bullet-riddled copy of the Quran, Islam’s holy text, was found outside of an Islamic clothing store. The owner of Al-Farah Islamic Clothing in Anaheim, Calif., found the English translation of the Quran pierced with multiple holes and hanging on the front door of the store Tuesday morning. 8:13 p.m.: Mocking “thoughts and prayers” makes its way around the MSM:   8:11 p.m.: And now, via Raheem Kassam, video of police clearing a suspicious package from the street:  7:49 p.m.: Video of the bomb disposal robot:   7:41 p.m.: Raheem Kassam: Police say they don’t know whether to expect a controlled explosion. There is a bag in the street. The bomb robot was near the bag but backed away. Police then asked reporters to move back another block. 7:37 p.m.: Via Raheem Kassam, police are currently deploying a bomb disposal robot: 7:32 p.m.: An unconfirmed account from a man claiming to be Farook’s father describes him as a “very religious” Muslim. “I haven’t heard anything. He worked in a county office,” Farook’s dad told The News. “He’s married and has a kid. We’re estranged because my wife got the divorce, and they are together. She doesn’t want to see me.” Farook said he hasn’t seen his son in some time. “He was very religious. He would go to work, come back, go to pray, come back. He’s Muslim.” 7:13 p.m.: Raheem Kassam reports: Resident of Richardson St. says one suspect, he believes, was in a boat in the back of his neighbour’s house, an image reminiscent of the ending of the Boston Marathon bombing’s manhunt. Another resident says her 14 year-old daughter is home alone down Richardson St., where the crime scene is currently blocked off, and police will not allow the mother to go to her.  7:10 p.m.: Dr. Ben Carson calls the San Bernardino slaughter a “hate crime”: When asked by ABC News to clarify what exactly he means by “hate crime” in this instance, Carson said, “Well it’s hard to imagine that you would shoot a bunch of people and not hate them, right? You don’t do that to people you love.” 6:59 p.m.: Raheem Kassam and Michelle Moons report from San Bernardino (with video): The town is eerily quiet, as you might expect following the atrocity in San Bernardino earlier today. … At the time of reporting, the police tell us San Bernardino Avenue is “still an active crime scene” and stated the fact there were multiple other active crime scenes. 6:43 p.m.: The Daily Beast reports that a police warrant singled out an address belonging to Syed Farook. The article shares a purported Facebook photo of Farook (Update: The Daily Beast appeared to name the wrong person and the photo has been removed). 6:32 p.m.: NBC goes further and states that a second suspect could be Farook’s brother:  6:15 p.m.: NBC News investigative reporter Tom Winter reports that law enforcement sources indicate one suspect may be a man named Sayeed Farook. Multiple law enforcement sources in multiple agencies tell NBC News that one of the suspects in the San Bernardino shooting is Sayeed Farook — Tom Winter (@Tom_Winter) December 3, 2015 The Los Angeles Times reports that its sources indicate the lead gunman was a U.S. citizen. 6:00 p.m.: Adelle Nazarian of  News notes that CNN analysts say the attack looks like terrorism: Speaking on CNN’s Out Front with Erin Burnett Wednesday, former CIA case officer Robert Baer said the most “disturbing” aspect of the deadly San Bernardino shooting is that it was carried out using tactics that are employed in the Middle East. “What I don’t like about this shooting is multiple shooters… IEDs… I say this very reluctantly, but this has the hallmarks of the sort of attacks you see in the Middle East,” Baer said. Former FBI special agent Robert Chacon agreed with Baer’s assertions later on in the show. Meanwhile, local NBC News is reporting the progress of the SWAT team in entering the Redlands house of one of the suspects: DEVELOPING: SWAT vehicle ramming home in Redlands, Calif., near San Bernardino. LIVE:  pic.twitter.com/KLZ08LeW9O — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) December 3, 2015 5:45 p.m.: The local police chief says that the suspects came to the scene “dressed and equipped.” They had “assault-style” rifles. The device that officers feared was a pipe bomb turned out not to be an explosive. It is possible the third suspect was not involved. 5:42 p.m.: Local and federal law enforcement authorities are addressing a press conference. The new casualty numbers are 14 dead and 17 wounded. Two of the suspects–one male, one female–are dead. A third has been detained. None has yet been identified and their ages have not been given. A home linked to a suspect is being searched in Redlands–“very cautiously,” says the FBI, given the potential for booby traps. The FBI says that terrorism is a “possibility” but still not certain: “It is a possibility but we don’t know that yet. And we’re not wiling to go down that road yet.” 5:15 p.m.: CNN reports that the conference center at the Inland Regional Center, which is where the shooting took place, had been rented by San Bernadino County personnel for the purpose of holding an annual holiday party. 4:55 p.m.: CNN reports that a home in Redlands, CA is being searched and that one of the suspects apparently lives there. The reports of pipe bombs have been confirmed. The suspects apparently threw them from the SUV to distract police during the chase. 4:43 p.m.: Via AFP: San Bernardino (United States) (AFP) – “Suspects are down” in the hunt for as many as three gunmen who opened fire at a center for the disabled in California on Wednesday, killing at least 14 people, police said. San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan tweeted: “Suspects are down, one officer wounded. Details still unfolding.” He warned residents living near the scene of the police confrontation with the suspects to stay in their homes.  4:25 p.m.: Rick Serrano of the Los Angeles Times reports that federal officials believe the shooting is a kind of workplace dispute. Federal officials also regarded the Fort Hood terror attack as workplace violence. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson) 4:13 p.m.: Vicki Cervantes of the San Bernadino Police Department told reporters that one suspect is down, one being “dealt with,” and another possible being pursued. Another update is promised at 4:45 p.m. PST. Meanwhile, California Gov. Jerry Brown has issued a simple statement: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims’ families and everyone affected by the brutal attack. California will spare no effort in bringing these killers to justice.” He also ordered flags at the State Capitol lowered to half-staff. One report indicates that ISIS supporters are celebrating the attack on Twitter. 3:55 p.m.: Police scanner reports one suspect as “female Arabic.” Neighbors are calling police to report a fleeing suspect with an orange shirt and camouflage pants. Gov. Jerry Brown has canceled this evening’s Christmas tree-lighting ceremony, according to the Sacramento Bee. 3:52 p.m.: One reporter says that all the suspects are “dead or in custody.” But police scanners are humming with reports of suspects seen at the local Rite-Aid, the Wells Fargo parking lot, and in other locations, some apparently wearing masks. Police want people to stay in their homes. 3:47 p.m.: Mayor R. Carey Davis has posted a statement on Facebook responding to the shooting, calling for unity and prayer. 3:43 p.m.: Police scanner reports a suspect “north of Gould, south of Richardson, to the rear of a church.” The suspect appears to be the one in an orange shirt and camouflage pants. Officers are requesting reinforcements. 3:40 p.m.: Police are sending a bomb disposal unit to the location of a suspected pipe bomb at 1731 San Bernardino Ave. They are also searching for a man in orange shirt and camouflage pants moving southbound. 3:35 p.m.: Police appear to be in a standoff with some of the surviving suspects. They may be looking for others. They are clearing an area of San Bernadino Avenue. There is chatter on the police scanner about a “pipe bomb.” 3:23 p.m.: Police report one suspect in custody and one fleeing on foot. They have established a perimeter around a residential neighborhood in San Bernadino. 3:15 p.m.: Police scanners report an officer down and a pursuit in the area of 2nd Street and Bryant Street in San Bernadino, which are parallel east-west streets about 2.5 miles due north of the site of the shooting. 3:12 p.m. Police scanners are reporting that officers have exchanged fire with the occupant(s) of a black SUV. One reports “suspect down in the westbound lane” of the 10 freeway. Helicopter shots from KABC show police vehicles surrounding someone on the ground, and a car crashed nearby. Earlier scanner reports indicated a chase at 110 mph, but it was not clear if it was related. 3:05 p.m.: The Los Angeles Times has posted amateur video of the shooting by a nurse at the center who watched police storm the building and thought at the time that they were carrying out a drill, not an actual response to an active shooter situation. 3:00 p.m.: There are conflicting reports from police. Publicly, police seem to be saying that they do not know who the suspects are, or where they are. On the police scanner, however, there is talk of “two at gunpoint” and pursuit of a male in camouflage. The Chicago Tribune reports that 10 of the wounded are in critical condition, three in serious condition. Update: 10 of the wounded in San Bernardino shooting in critical condition, 3 serious  — Chicago Tribune (@chicagotribune) December 2, 2015 2:40 p.m.:  News’ John Nolte weighs in on the reaction of some in the liberal media: As good people on social media watched unspeakable events unfurl in San Bernadino, California, on their television sets, all one could do in a situation where you can really do nothing is pray and offer those prayers to the world. Naturally, elite members of our media will use any opportunity to mock the Faithful. Even 14 still-warm dead bodies won’t stop them from attacking those who offer a heartfelt “thoughts and prayers” sentiment. 2:30 p.m.: Police told reporters at the news conference that they can neither confirm nor deny the shooting is a terrorist attack. The FBI has said similar things, according to Fox News, which adds that police say that “at minimum, we have a domestic terror situation.” The suspects came as if “on a mission.” It appears less likely that this is a workplace shooting or a random attack. #BreakingNews witness described one possible suspect as large guy dressed in black, wearing a black mask with a large gun. #SBShootings — Randy Mac (@RandyNBCLA) December 2, 2015 2:10 p.m.: Various reports on the police scanner suggest possible sightings of the weapons used in the shooting, and possibly a suspect as well: “Vehicle on golf course with multiple weapons inside. One at gunpoint.” Police report that long guns, not handguns, were used. #BreakingNews Gunmen used rifles according to authorities. victims were centrally located inside building possibly gathered for a luncheon. — Randy Mac (@RandyNBCLA) December 2, 2015 2:00 p.m.: San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan told a news conference that there are at least 14 dead and 14 injured. 1:55 p.m.: Not to be outdone, Vox.com’s Matthew Yglesias joined in the mockery of people praying for the victims: Other countries must have fewer mass shootings because their conservative politicians offer thoughts and prayers more vigorously. — Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) December 2, 2015 1:50 p.m.: With bodies still warm, victims being rushed to hospital, and gunmen on the loose, President Barack Obama has renewed his calls for gun control. Pres Obama again says Congress can do more to prevent gun violence. Laments that people on TSA No Fly List can still buy a gun. — Mark Knoller (@markknoller) December 2, 2015 The Huffington Post’s Sam Stein and Arthur Delaney are mocking people tweeting prayers for the victims and those in the line of fire: Public officials are the people society trusts to solve society’s ills. Like, say, gun violence. But every time multiple people have been gunned down in a mass shooting, all these officials can seemingly do is rush to offer their useless thoughts and prayers. And so they did after news broke about multiple casualties in San Bernardino, California, on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the emergency continues. The Los Angeles Times reports: The Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, which is reportedly treating some victims of the shooting, will be on lockdown for at least the next six hours, security guards said. Nobody is being allowed in the main entrance. The Norton Space and Aeronautics Academy, which accepts students in kindergarten through eighth grade, is a block north of the Inland Regional Center, where the shooting took place. 1:30 p.m.: Multiple news agencies now report police activity in Pasadena, about an hour’s drive west of San Bernardino, north-northeast of downtown Los Angeles. News sources indicate that there is SWAT activity and that it is “related.” #Pasadena SWAT scene that @NBCLA says is RELATED to #SanBernardino shooting is about an hour away pic.twitter.com/H487F0dYuG — Mike Valerio (@MikeNBC12) December 2, 2015 1:20 p.m.: Unconfirmed police scanner reports indicate: “Man in military fatigues currently at Roberts Elementary school.” The scanner also reports a “Middle Eastern male” with “long beard, tactical shorts and a backpack.” Again, the reports are unconfirmed. Reuters is reporting three confirmed fatalities. Multiple agencies report witnesses being evacuated for police interviews, presumably to find clues that could lead to the gunmen’s identification and/or capture. 1:10 p.m.: Fox News reports that the gunmen attacked a Christmas party being held in a rented conference room at the center, and were wearing “military-style” clothing. None of the suspected gunmen are in custody and all are presumed armed and dangerous. Speaking with local ABC News reporters, police have confirmed “fatalities” and “some type of function” at the center. 1:00 p.m.: The area near the Inland Regional Center remains locked down, including civic buildings. There are numerous unconfirmed report of a suspect’s name, which  News is unable to confirm and therefore cannot report at this time. 12:40 p.m.: Though the active shooter situation is still ongoing, Democrats are not losing the opportunity to weigh in on gun control, the National Rifle Association, and other pet causes.

All three suspects are believe to be armed with rifles and are all at large. Police are using a robot to detonate what they suspect may be an explosive device that was apparently left at the center. The local police scanner is referring to an improvised explosive device (IED). Authorities are also looking for an SUV that left the scene.

        "articles": "Retail giant Target is losing sales and may be on track for another major stock-drop in the second quarter, analysts say, amid a growing boycott caused by the company’s transgender friendly policies. The company’s second-quarter sales, from April to June, may drop as much as 2 percent compared to the prior year, executives told reporters and Wall Street analysts. That’s “horrendous,” said Jim Cramer, founder of the stock-market website, TheStreet.com. The earnings prediction comes a month after the left-leaning company announced April 19 that it would allow men claiming to be women to use the women’s bathrooms and changing rooms at its stores. The decision has sparked a boycott petition effort that garnered over 1.2 million signers in only a week. Target executives deny the pro-family consumer boycott is making a significant difference. But, according to TheStreet.com, the business-news website, “We have seen a noticeable slowdown post-Easter,” Target CFO [chief financial officer] Cathy Smith said on a call with reporters. Target’s CEO Brian Cornell, who was also on the call, blamed the slowdown on unfavorable weather trends in the Northeast and volatile economic trends. Cornell also said the company has not seen a “material” impact to its overall business from the protests, but has seen some hit to sales in a “handful” of stores. He declined to quantify the extent of the hit, however. According to the Associated Press, Target expected a sales growth in new stores to hit 1.6 percent in the first quarter, but only realized a 1.2 percent growth. This week, the company announced a reshuffle in the executive office. Stock-pickers are getting nervous about the company’s executives. “Target is now a question… because the degredation of Target from month to month to month has them confused,” said Jim Cramer, founder of TheStreet.com. “Apparel [sales] is not good, electronics is not good, the [earnings] guidance is horrendous,” he said. Amid Target’s troubles, Costco and the Walmart company will likely gain, he said. Target’s stock has fallen 20 percent — from $84 per share to $67 per share — since it imposed the pro-transgender policy on its customer base of families. That loss has chopped roughly $10 billion from the overall shareholder value of the company, according to a chart produced by Yahoo.com Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com PoliticsPre-ViraleconomyTargetTransgendertransgender bathrooms .

        "articles": "Italian carmaker Fiat and its U.S. unit Chrysler are set to sign a new agreement with Guangzhou Automobile Group Co to produce the Jeep vehicle for the Chinese market, Il Corriere della Sera said on Sunday. In an unsourced article, the Corriere said the head of Fiat and Chrysler Sergio Marchionne could announce the agreement at the Detroit auto show, which kicks off on Monday. Under the agreement, off-road vehicles under the Jeep brand will be produced at GAC’s Canton factory, the paper said. This report debunks the supposedly neutral fact-checking organization Politifact’s claim that Mitt Romney’s campaign advertisement during the 2012 that alleged Obama sold Chrysler to Italians “who are going to build Jeeps in China” was 2012’s “Lie of the Year.” Politifact announced that Mitt Romney’s “Jeep” ad was its “2012 Lie of the Year” even though the ad was factually true. Romney slightly misspoke on the stump about Fiat’s intention to produce Jeeps in China, but reports about Fiat, which owns Chrysler, building Jeeps in China surfaced as early as 2010. And the campaign ad simply stated: Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job. Even liberal publications like Mother Jones and mainstream newspapers like the Washington Post conceded the advertisement was factually true or true on the merits. This is not the first time Politifact’s “lie of the year” has been completely debunked after the fact. In 2009, Politifact announced that former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s claim about “death panels” in Obamacare was its “Lie of the Year.” After Palin revealed what Rush Limbaugh said was a “hidden truth,” the Obama administration removed the so-called “death panels” from its initial Obamacare bill. And three years later, former Obama adviser Steve Rattner, in a New York Times op-ed, said the country actually needed “death panels” to ration health care. In 2010, Politifact determined that claims by conservatives that Obamacare would lead to a “government takeover” of healthcare was the “Lie of the Year.” After Obamacare was passed and upheld by the Supreme Court, the IRS issued a 160-page document explaining the Obamacare tax/surcharge and private businesses like Hobby Lobby have been threatened because they refuse to comply with the bill’s birth control mandate. And there are even more provisions in the bill, some of which have still yet to be unearthed, that expand the scope of government involvement in the country’s health care.

        "articles": "Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and the Democrats attempted Thursday to deny President Donald Trump’s claims of “Spygate” after they emerged from a bipartisan briefing about the FBI’s investigation into his 2016 campaign. Following their lead, the mainstream media have labeled “Spygate” a “conspiracy theory” — even though Obama administration officials like former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have admitted to the spying. Schiff, the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, emerged from Thursday’s briefing to read a statement on behalf of the Democratic Party leadership in Congress, attacking Trump’s claims: Today’s “Gang of Eight” briefing was conducted to ensure protection of sources and methods. Nothing we heard today has changed our view that there’s no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign, or otherwise failed to follow appropriate procedures and protocols. That is the basis for claims like MSNBC’s “Trump’s nonsensical ‘Spygate’ conspiracy theory ends with a whimper.” But a careful reading of Schiff’s statement reveals that he and Democratic leaders are attempting to fool the public. First, it is important to note that Democrats, and the mainstream media, are disputing the term “spy.” They admit that there was an “informant” but refuse to allow the term “spy,” though in this context it means the same thing. Second, note that Schiff said that Democrats merely said their “view”of the evidence has not changed. He did not say, nor could he, that “no evidence” existed as a matter of undisputed fact — because the evidence is already public. Third, and most crucially, Schiff said Democrats did not believe “the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign.” He did not deny that a spy, or spies, might have been recruited from within the campaign. Note how Schiff’s statement moved from language covering all possibilities (“the FBI or any intelligence agency”) to language covering only one possibility (“placed a spy”). That is an incomplete denial, and likely a deliberate one. Update: Melissa Francis of Fox News observed Friday that another reason “nothing” Democrats heard Thursday had changed their minds is that the Department of Justice failed to provide the documents that Congress requested.) Finally, Schiff and the Democrats said that the FBI and the intelligence services “follow[ed] appropriate procedures and protocols.” That little coda is meant to suggest, as Clapper has argued, that whatever spying (or “informing”) took place was completely justified — i.e. it was an attempt to spy on the Russians from within the campaign, not on the campaign itself. That excuse, of course, presumes that there was collusion between the campaign and Russia. In short, the statement Schiff delivered yesterday, and which Democrats and the media are relying on today, is the same nonsense that he has been feeding the public for two years in an effort to sustain the Russia conspiracy theory. Mollie Hemingway of the Federalist summed it up perfectly Thursday in an appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight: Everyone knows that there was a spy and in fact people who were involved in the spying are admitting there’s a spy. They’re saying, though, because the government term is “human intelligence informant” or something like that that therefore it’s not a spy. Whereas normal Americans understand when you are gathering information on someone surreptitiously, that’s the common definition of spying. And more than that, that’s just a stunning revelation that this was happening under the previous administration that there would be this kind of surveillance, not just at least one human intelligence informant but also wiretaps, national security letters which are how can you secretly get a subpoena and who knows what else is going on like widespread spying involving multiple people in the Trump campaign and we still don’t really know what’s going on because they’re trying to fight answering. That is the simple truth that Schiff, the Democrats, and the media are trying — and failing — to hide from the public. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at  News.

        "articles": "WASHINGTON—In a development that’s likely to cause fits for President Barack Obama, the Senate Democrats’ next leader, Charles Schumer, told an 2007 audience — on video — that he wanted to block any Supreme Court nominations for the last 18 months of President George W. Bush’s presidency. That’s seven months longer than the amount of time remaining to Obama’s presidency. The political situation in 2007 was a mirror image of the current face-off created by Justice Antonin Scalia’s unexpected death. Bush was in his second term in the White House, and the Democrats had retaken the Senate in the 2006 midterm elections. The incumbent president had already made two Supreme Court appointments, John Roberts and Samuel Alito. Schumer’s audience was the American Constitution Society (ACS), a left-wing legal organization. The society was founded in an effort to limit the impact that the Federalist Society was having on promoting conservative legal principles in American law schools, which are notoriously liberal. On July 27, 2007, Schumer told his ACS audience: How do we apply the lessons we learned from Roberts and Alito to be the next nominee, especially if—God forbid—there is another vacancy under this president? … [F]or the rest of this president’s term and if there is another Republican elected with the same selection criteria let me say this: We should reverse the presumption of confirmation. The Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance. We cannot afford to see Justice Stevens replaced by another Roberts, or Justice Ginsburg by another Alito. Given the track record of this president and the experience of obfuscation at the hearings—with respect to the Supreme Court, at least—I will recommend to my colleagues that we should not confirm a Supreme Court nominee except in extraordinary circumstances. Schumer is slated to replace Harry Reid as the Democrats’ leader in the Senate after this year, when Reid retires. No word yet from Schumer as to why it is acceptable for Democrats to not act on a Republican nomination to the Supreme Court for 18 months, but it is unacceptable for Republicans to not act on a Democratic nomination for 11 months. Scalia was the faculty advisor at the University of Chicago of one of the founding chapters of the Federalist Society, a student chapter started by David McIntosh, who later became a lawyer in the Reagan administration and then a congressman from Indiana. McIntosh is now president of the Club for Growth, and vice chairman of the Federalist Society. Ken Klukowski is legal editor for  News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.

        "articles": "Comedian Dana Carvey understands why comedians initially tread carefully when joking about President Barack Obama, the nation’s first black Commander in Chief. What the former Saturday Night Live standout can’t fathom is why fellow comic Dennis Miller got taken to the pop culture woodshed for embracing conservatism. Carvey expounded on his career, political humor and the host of radio’s syndicated program The Dennis Miller Show during a wide-ranging chat with Carl Kozlowski’s Radio Titans podcast Kozversations. The pair addressed the current state of political comedy, with Carvey sharing how he views his role as a stand-up and social commentator. In short, it’s all about the person in power at the moment. When it came to President Obama, that process hit a snag initially. “It took a while to find a way to satirize our president,” Carvey told Kozlowski. That doesn’t mean comedians should stay away from Obama jokes. It’s certainly not his method. “I always grew up with ‘question authority,'” he says, adding that approach applies to any president regardless of race, creed or color. “I’m from the old school–you go where the power is and you try to make fun of it,” he says. “When it becomes off limits to say or do certain things without being brutalized or censored or whatever, it’s unfortunate.” That, to Carvey’s estimation, is what happened to fellow SNL alum Miller for approaching political humor from the right. “If you live in New York or L.A. and you’re liberal and you’re playing to a liberal crowd it’s almost like a rally … it’s not edgy,” he says. “The true edge is what Dennis Miller did, and he’s been brutalized for it.” Carvey said that now people are “afraid to make fun” of the president in the major comedy hubs of NYC and Los Angeles because they’ll be “labeled.” Carvey, whose masterful impression of President George H.W. Bush made even the elder Bush a fan, says he proudly embraces a bipartisan approach to humor. “I take pride in having liberals and conservatives in the crowd,” he says.

        "articles": "An ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Donald Trump leading the race to become the Republican nominee for President of the United States. However, if the field were to consolidate, the billionaire businessman would no longer be favored in a head-to-head situation, according to the survey. The real estate mogul leads with 34 percent support nationally, followed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) with 25 percent, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) at 18 percent, and John Kasich rounding out the field with 13 percent, the poll results say. “Trump’s support has essentially remained unchanged for months,” the report released with the poll said. Both Cruz and Rubio defeat Trump in a hypothetical head-to-head scenario. Cruz easily defeats Trump head-to-head 54-41 percent. non-Cruz or Trump supporters prefer Cruz to Trump 72-17 percent. Among “very conservative voters,” Cruz takes down Trump 60-34 percent. Among white evangelicals, Cruz handles Trump 64-31 percent. Rubio also defeats Trump, but by smaller margins, 51-45 percent. Non-Rubio or Trump voters favor Rubio 69-23 percent. He, like Cruz, is favored by approximately 60% of women in a head-to-head with Trump. Only 51 percent of those surveyed felt that they would be satisfied with Trump’s nomination, and 52 percent said they view him favorably. Cruz has the highest net favorability rating at 65 percent. The poll also surveyed Democrat voters. It found that Hillary Clinton leads Sen. Bernie Sanders nationally, 49-42 percent. By a 69-29 percent divide, American view the current political system as “dysfunctional,” according to the survey. Yet, only 21 percent are angry at the government.

        "articles": "Left media is ablaze with articles condemning the police response to a pool party at a McKinney, Texas, subdivision. Now a video is emerging showing why police were called to the scene to begin with – violence. Residents in a McKinney subdivision were hosting an end-of-school party in their private community pool. Many teens who were not residents of the subdivision began showing up. Some had been invited by residents, some had not. An ad for the event had been placed on social media sites. Teens who were not invited began climbing the fence to get in, according to reports from residents of the area. Trouble began when they were asked to leave by residents and pool management. Now, at least one video (below) shows a fight that broke out between a teenage girl and two adults. comments-ie. black kids should go back to public housing led to adult women fighting kids pic.twitter.com/5ZNSzZymzs @NewsRevo vid @k1dmars — Revolution News (@NewsRevo) June 7, 2015 Police were called to the scene and attempted to get some of the trespassers to sit down while they investigated. Many of the teens fled and police chased some of them down. This is when the video of the incident with police began. There does not appear to be any video of the initial police contact with the teens. One resident, Benet Embry, a black man, posted on Facebook about the events leading up to the police call. “Look, I LIVE in this community and this ENTIRE incident is NOT racial at all,” Embry wrote. “A few THUGS spoiled a COMMUNITY event by fighting, jumping over fences into a PRIVATE pool, harassing and damaging property. Not EVERYTHING is about RACE. WE have other issues that NEED our attention other flights of made up make believe causes.” In another post he is critical of media coverage of the incident. “I’ve never seen such irresponsible reporting and miss management of media resources in my life,” he said. Another McKinney resident, Bryan Gestner, posted on Facebook, “This was a Twitter party that turned into a mob event. Jumping pool fence. Assaulting 2 security guards, attacking a mother with three little girls. The video doesn’t show everything.” He continued saying the kids were drinking and “smoking weed” and they would not listen to any of the adults around the pool. “This isn’t about race,” he continued. “This is about outside kids invading our neighborhood and had no respect for authority or the residents here. I have a target on my back now and I have been threatened by these punks that they are gonna shoot up my house when all I did was try to control the mob and actually tended to the girl and the boy that had a bloody lip.” “Yall don’t know the whole story,” Gestner continued. “I commend the officer for handling this situation.” Gestner wrapped up his post alleging that these same kids came back into the neighborhood Saturday night. They were “kicking in people’s front door, stole a truck and crashed it into many vehicles. They vandalized dozens of cars and were stealing things.” Bob Price is a senior political news contributor for  Texas and a member of the original  Texas team. Follow him on Twitter @BobPriceBBTX.

        "articles": "NAPLES, Florida — In an exclusive interview with  News, likely 2016 GOP presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) staked out a bold position on a foreign policy matter—pushing to arm Kurdish fighters against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) even more than the U.S. has already done, but also calling for the creation of a new nation of Kurdistan. “Part of the problem is the Kurds aren’t getting enough arms,” Paul said. “The Kurds are the best fighters. The arms are going through Baghdad to get to the Kurds and they’re being siphoned off and they’re not getting what they need. I think any arms coming from us or coming from any European countries ought to go directly to the Kurds. They seem to be the most effective and most determined fighters.” In addition, Paul called for giving the Kurds their own country for them to defend against radical Islamists. “But I would go one step further: I would draw new lines for Kurdistan and I would promise them a country,” Paul said. I think they would fight like hell if we promised them a country. It’s a little easier to say than it is to actually make it happen, because in order to actually draw a new country you’d have to have the complicity of Turkey and probably Iraq a little bit as well. There really is no Syria to be complicit with, but there is just a little piece of Syria—Kobani and in there is predominantly Kurdish. I think if you did that and could get piece between the Kurds and the Turks, and then the Turks would actually fight if the Kurds would give up any claim to Turkish territory. Traditionally, “Kurdistan”–which isn’t a country but a region that’s spread across four different nations where Kurdish people have lived since ancient times–falls in regions of Turkey, Iran, Iraq and a small part of Syria. Paul said that the president’s decision to ignore the Islamic, or religious, component to radical Islam is extraordinarily troubling. But he also said he thinks there should be “boots on the ground” to battle ISIS—but those boots on the ground need to be primarily Muslim soldiers standing up against the radical elements of their religion. “I think that you’re naive is you ignore the religious component to these wars,” Paul said. There’s a thousand year war between Sunni and Shia. There’s a more recent war between radical Islam and civilized Islam and between radical Islam and the West. But it’s all about religion and has to do with different religious sects. If you don’t understand the religion, then you won’t be able to get a solution. So for example Mosul is predominantly, vastly Sunni Muslim. No Shia army is going to be able to occupy and control Mosul. It’s going to need to be Sunni. When people say boots on the ground, I agree—there need to be Arab boots on the ground. And they need to be able to recognize the religious part of the conflict and there can’t just be Arab boots on the ground they need to be Arab Sunni boots on the ground to take back the areas that are predominantly Sunni. Earlier in the day, before this interview on a campaign trip to southwest Florida, Paul discussed these same issues—and made the point that the boots on the ground need to be Muslims killing ISIS—in a grassroots meeting with conservative and Republican activists in the state. The Republican activists in Collier County rose in a standing ovation when Paul made the point. Paul’s position is in line with that of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who earlier in February had said he wants to arm the Kurds. “You know, I don’t believe right now we need American boots on the ground, and the reason is, we have boots on the ground already, with the Kurds,” Cruz said on ABC’s This Week in early February. “The Peshmerga are trained, effective fighters.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), another potential 2016 presidential candidate, has called for 10,000 U.S. troops to be sent in to battle ISIS in addition to arming the Kurds. But a lot of war-weary Americans–while not unopposed to sending in U.S. troops–are worried about getting into another war when Muslim forces aren’t willing to stand up to their own religion’s radical elements.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) said had the Senate removed President Donald Trump as a result of his impeachment trial, coronavirus casualties in America would not be on some days the “equivalent of the number of people we lost on 9/11.” Anchor Lawrence O’Donnell said, “We can’t act even slightly surprised by this because you told us this was going to happen in your argument in the Senate impeachment trial.” Schiff said, “Well, we certainly told the senators that he was not going to change, and there was no way to constrain him. That he is who he is, and he would continue to operate the way he had, and indeed, that’s exactly what we’ve seen since. The one thing we dramatically understated is when we asked the question if you found him guilty, do you really need to remove him given there is another election only nine months away, how much damage could he really do?” He continued, “We said a lot, but little did we know just how great the casualties would be. Some days we lose the equivalent of the number of people we lost on 9/11.

        "articles": "Buckingham Palace has hired external investigators to look into claims that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, had bullied royal staff, with a source telling British media: “There are some harrowing stories to tell.” Media had reported earlier this month on a complaint from 2018, when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were still living at Kensington Palace, that Meghan had forced two personal assistants to leave and she had allegedly “undermin[ed] the confidence” of a third member of staff. One royal source speaking to The Times on Sunday said that “the actual worst incidences haven’t come out. There are some harrowing stories to tell.” While another source from within Buckingham Palace told Britain’s newspaper of record: “There’s a lot that could come out in the wash that hasn’t been told.” In 2018, Jason Knauf, the couple’s then-communications secretary, had reportedly sent an email to the Duke of Cambridge Prince William’s then-private secretary Simon Case, saying: “I am very concerned that the Duchess was able to bully two PAs out of the household in the past year. The treatment of X [name redacted by The Times] was totally unacceptable.” Mr Knauf added: “The Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights. She is bullying Y [name redacted by The Times] and seeking to undermine her confidence. We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y.” The sources also described how the tense atmosphere at Kensington Palace, which the Sussexes shared with the Cambridges until early 2019, left staff in a state of fear, with one, anticipating a conflict with Meghan, reportedly telling a colleague: “I can’t stop shaking.” Hollywood’s Duchess Meghan had complained to broadcaster ITV over Piers Morgan’s criticisms of the woke royals’ tell-all interview, before the firebrand journalist quit breakfast show Good Morning Britain.  —  London (@London) March 10, 2021 Reports from earlier this month claimed that at least 10 former staff members are allegedly ready to discuss claims that colleagues were “humiliated” and victims of “emotional cruelty and manipulation” by the Duchess of Sussex. Sources speaking to The Times on Sunday also denied Prince Harry’s claims that Prince Charles had financially him cut off or allegations Meghan had not received help when she complained of mental health struggles. “It was a surprise to hear he’d been cut off, given the bank statements. The prince continued to provide Harry and Meghan with financial support after their move to America, while they found their feet,” a source close to the Prince of Wales told the newspaper. Another insider said that Harry and Meghan’s mental health was a “very open part of the conversations generally” in the offices. Another contested statement made during last week’s interview was that the couple had been married by the Archbishop of Canterbury privately and alone in their garden days before their public, multi-million-pound wedding. The claim raised questions as Church of England rules stipulate a couple already married cannot be married again, any marriage requires two witnesses, and marriages should take place indoors. Speaking to ChronicleLive on Sunday, Rev Mark Edwards said that when he spoke to a member of staff at Lambeth Palace, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s official London residence, the source confirmed that “[Archbishop Justin Welby] had a private conversation with the couple in the garden about the wedding, but I can assure you, no wedding took place until the televised national event.” Buckingham Palace had decided to bring in an external law firm to handle the investigation rather than undertaking it internally. Details are not expected to be made public so that those giving evidence can “feel comfortable”, insiders said. According to Times sources, no timeframe has been set, but it is expected to start shortly. However, the Sussexes have not been invited to take part, with the Mail on Sunday reporting that Meghan had allegedly demanded to see texts, emails, and other documents related to the complaints against her.

According to Stephen Frank at California Political Review, “our confused governor” should have known that Boulder Electric Vehicle, a Colorado based company, would expend just under 20% more in taxes in California than they would in other states. Moreover, the company would need to endure a multitude of environmental regulations associated with producing electric cars in the Golden State. The San Fernando Valley Business Journal reported that Boulder Electric, founded in 2011, was developing delivery vans, flatbeds and service trucks with a range of 80 to 120 miles and a top speed of 70 mph for corporate customers and municipalities. Boulder Electric was one of eleven companies receiving state grants for the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program. “We have essentially mothballed the company. We are not filing bankruptcy,” company Chief Executive Carter Brown told the Journal. Another company biting the dust in California further dampens the already dismal job market in the state. According to an article in Newsmax in April, at least sixty companies left California for Texas, and in 2011 the Orange County Register identified 254 companies left California to do business in another state.

        "articles": "A Texas House Joint Resolution passed Thursday would, if passed by the Texas State Senate, ask the U.S. Congress to call an Article 5 convention, which would propose Constitutional amendments to impose fiscal restraint on the federal government, reduce its powers and jurisdiction, and limit the terms of office for federal officials and members of Congress. Article 5 of the U.S. Constitution requires Congress to call a convention to propose constitutional amendments if the legislatures of two-thirds of the states apply. Amendments adopted at an Article 5 convention would require ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures. In 1977, the 65th Texas Legislature submitted HCR Number 31 to the federal government, asking Congress to prepare and submit to the several states an amendment to the U.S. Constitution requiring a federal balanced budget. In the alternative, it asked Congress to call a Constitutional convention for the purpose of proposing a balanced-budget amendment. The new application would serve as a continuing application, pursuant to Article 5, unless rescinded by a future legislature. The Texas request would stand until at least two-thirds of state legislatures applied for a convention that would impose restraint on the federal government’s spending and jurisdiction, as well as term limits for federal representatives and officials. If the resolution also passes the Texas State Senate, the Texas Secretary of State will forward copies to the President, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, President of the U.S. Senate, and all members of the Texas delegation to Congress, as well as secretaries of state and presiding officers of other state legislatures. A request to enter the resolution officially in the Congressional Record would also be made. Texas House Joint Resolution 77 is authored by Representatives Rick Miller (R-Sugarland), Dwayne Bohac (R-Houston), John Zerwas (R-Richmond), Allen Fletcher (R-Houston), and Dan Huberty (R-Houston). Rep. Rick Miller told  Texas, “Courage is a price for liberty. We must not be afraid to use what the Founders gave us in the Constitution in Article V to reign in the Federal Government and restore our Nation to greatness. This is the pathway for the states to exercise their sovereignty.” Rep. Dwayne Bohac said, “Our Founding Fathers provided for an Article V Convention as a check on the federal government by the states. Let’s remember that it was the states that created the federal government, and they answer to us. It’s time for the states to stand up to runaway spending and limit the jurisdiction of the federal government, and Texas should lead the way.” 42 Texas State House Representatives are named as co-authors of the resolution. One of those co-authors, Rep. Debbie Riddle (R-Tomball), told  Texas, “H.J.R. 77 sends a loud, clear message to Washington, D.C., that out-of-control spending, and not respecting states’ rights will be coming to an end. In Texas, we are required to have a balanced budget – like every family must do – our Feds must do the same.” Proponents believe that the resolution is a necessary action to impose restraint on a runaway federal government that is no longer responsive to the American people. Opponents claim that an Article 5 convention has the potential to fundamentally rewrite the federal Constitution, since liberal states would participate in the convention. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is among those opposed to calling a constitutional convention at this time. “A constitutional convention is a horrible idea,” he said in an article published on Convention of the States. “This is not a good century to write a constitution.” Twenty-two states have passed resolutions supporting a convention to pass a balanced budget amendment, according to the State Government Leadership Foundation. Thirty-four states is the magic number that would authorize the convention. The likelihood that Congress will act increases as more states apply for an Article 5 Convention. The House Joint Resolution will now proceed to the Senate. If passed by the Senate, it will be sent to the Texas Secretary of State for appropriate action.

        "articles": "On Thursday, The Daily Beast, which does not determine the news cycle, tut-tutted the influence of the Drudge Report—which does. If that characterization of Drudge’s power seems simplistic, consider that these were the top non-celebrity news stories of 2014 in the United States, according to Yahoo!: Ebola, the death of Robin Williams, the midterm elections, leaked Internet photos of Hollywood celebrities, the missing Malaysian airliner, Ferguson, Jodi Arias, the rise of ISIS, the NFL’s domestic violence problem, and Obamacare. Drudge Report can clearly be linked with the prominence of several of these stories. Matt Drudge posts headlines long before the mainstream media have caught on and shines his traffic spotlight on stories he deems important. That, in turn, drives mainstream news coverage – or, in some cases, as with Obamacare, perhaps not. And that’s the point: the media need Drudge to point them in the right direction, apparently, but Drudge doesn’t need the media to make a story huge. When it comes to Ebola, Drudge obviously generated worldwide interest in the disease, forcing the Obama administration to confront a problem it considered second-tier for months after Ebola outbreaks in Africa. Drudge’s attention to the midterms trumped the media’s almost complete lack of interest in the elections – and his decision to focus in on immigration drove debate across the country and led to massive Republican turnout. Drudge drove coverage of the missing Malaysian airliner – at least until CNN turned it into ratings gold, and began praying for weekly missing airliners. The media certainly focused on Ferguson, but it was Drudge who defined the prevailing narratives about the subject: the racial hoax perpetrated on the American people, the media’s malfeasance and desire for a conflagration, the President’s feckless intervention. President Obama and company pretended that the rise of ISIS meant virtually nothing – at least until Drudge highlighted the suffering of the Yazidis and the continuous threats of beheading. And when it comes to Obamacare, there is little question that Drudge directing traffic to sites covering the utterly media-ignored story of Jonathan Gruber made Gruber a national story. Nonetheless, Drudge may be losing power, says The Daily Beast. The evidence? That Drudge has not chosen the nominees of the two parties. The Beast explains, “just as there is the so-called Money Primary, which involves the seeking out of the money people who can bankroll such a venture, there is the ‘The Drudge Primary’—the battle to curry favor with the Internet’s most notorious aggregator.” There is no doubt this is true. Many candidates wonder behind the scenes how to get Matt Drudge’s attention for various prospective campaign activities. But the Beast says that this is a waste of energy – that Drudge’s supposed preference for Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Scott Walker will matter little come election time: Some Republican operatives wonder if it will even much matter, if the era of Drudge has at last past. Today, when more and more people curate their own news through their social-media feeds and news sites spring up seemingly daily, the Drudge Report might look like a dinosaur. To push that notion, the Beast trots out former Hillary Clinton campaign spokesperson Phil Singer. “One big difference between 2016 and 2008 is that there are so many new platforms curating that type of content,” Singer told the outlet. “He really came of age in the pre-Twitter, pre-Facebook era—he’s sort of like a landline.” The Daily Beast admits that Drudge is still “a rather large [dinosaur],” but limits his influence to “older, conservative voters who are likely to vote in primaries and donate to campaigns… he is still believed to be the bookmarked URL of choice for talk-radio producers and a large portion of the Beltway press.” In other words, a huge chunk of those who vote, and a huge chunk of those who influence those who vote. Matt Drudge hasn’t lost one bit of influence. It’s just that the media largely scorn those he influences, even as they cheat off his paper.

        "articles": "The tragedy in Charlottesville could have been an occasion to stop and consider how the tolerance for politically correct violence and politically correct hatred is leading the nation towards civil war. Instead, the media and the political left have turned this incident into the biggest fake news story of the summer, transforming its real lessons into a morality play that justifies war against the political right, and against white people generally. The organizers of the “Unite the Right” demonstration in Charlottesville were repellent racists. But they came to defend a historic monument honoring a complex man and cause, and not to attack it or presumably anyone else. They applied for a permit and were denied. They re-applied successfully in a petition supported by the local ACLU. If they had come to precipitate violence, why would they have gone to the tedious trouble of applying for a permit? Who knows what – if anything – would have happened if that had been the end of the story and no one had shown up to oppose them. What “Unite the Right” actually demonstrated was that the assortment of neo-Nazis, pro-Confederates, and assorted yahoos gathered under the banner of the “Alt-Right” is actually a negligible group. This was a national show of strength that actually attracted a couple hundred people. Compare that to the tens of the thousands who can readily be marshaled by two violent groups of the left – Black Lives Matter and Antifa – and you get an idea of how marginal “white supremacists” are to America’s political and cultural life. Yet “white supremacy” and its evils became the centerpiece of all the fake news reporting on the event, including all the ludicrous attacks on the president for not condemning enough a bogeyman the whole nation condemns, and that no one but a risible fringe supports. Talk about virtue signaling! Omitted from the media coverage were the other forces at work in precipitating the battle of Emancipation Park, specifically Black Lives Matter and Antifa, two violent left-wing groups with racial agendas who came to squelch the demonstration in defense of the monument. Unlike the Unite the Right demonstrators, the leftist groups did not have a permit for Emancipation Park (they had permits for two nearby parks). But why should they need a permit, since the havoc they had previously wreaked in Ferguson, Berkeley, Sacramento, Portland and other cities, was accomplished without permits, while their criminality was presented by the media as “protests,” and their rioting went completely unpunished? In short, there were two demonstrations in Charlottesville – a legal protest by “Unite the Right” and a protest by the vigilantes of Antifa and Black Lives Matter. Who started the fight is really immaterial. Both sides were prepared for violence because these conflicts are already a pattern of our deteriorating civic life. Once the two sides had gathered in the same place, the violence was totally predictable. Two parties, two culpabilities; but except for the initial statement of President Trump, condemning both sides, only one party has been held accountable, and that happens to be the one that was in the park legally. What is taking place in the media accounts and political commentaries on this event is an effort by the left to turn the mayhem in Charlottesville into a template for their war against a mythical enemy – “white supremacy” – which is really a war on white people generally. The ideology that drives the left and divides our country is “identity politics” – the idea that the world consists of two groups – “people of color” who are guiltless and oppressed, and white people who are guilty and oppressors. This is the real race war. Its noxious themes inform the mindless, hysterical hatred for President Trump, and the equally mindless support for racist mobs like Black Lives Matter and Antifa. It is a war from which no good can come. But it won’t be stopped unless enough people have the courage to stand up and name it for what it is.

        "articles": "Religious provocateur Bill Donohue came under withering attack from fellow political conservatives for remarks that critics say blame the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attacks for their own deaths. Upon the brutal slaying of 12 satirical journalists in Paris this week Donohue, who runs the Catholic League for Civil and Religious Rights, condemned the killings, but went on to say, “But neither should we tolerate the kind of intolerance that provoked this violent reaction… What unites Muslims in their anger against Charlie Hebdo is the vulgar manner in which Muhammad has been portrayed. What they object to is being intentionally insulted over the course of many years. On this aspect, I am in total agreement with them.” Stephane Charbonnier, the paper’s publisher, was killed today in the slaughter. It is too bad that he didn’t understand the role he played in his tragic death. In 2012, when asked why he insults Muslims, he said, ‘Muhammad isn’t sacred to me.’ Had he not been so narcissistic, he may still be alive.” Radio host Hugh Hewitt and Megyn Kelly of Fox News strongly condemned Donohue’s comments. Hewitt, who identified himself as a practicing Catholic, told Donohue that he was “an embarrassment to the Catholic Church” and tried repeatedly to get Donohue to recant and apologize. Donohue said, “It will be a cold day in Hell” before he apologized. Donohue told Hewitt he is being supporting in his statement by “the clergy, Cardinals and Bishops” though he refused to name any of them and would only mention one of his board members as a supporter of his statement. Donohue urged Hewitt to go to his website, at which point Hewitt said, “I have no interest in doing anything to support an organization that will stand over the dead bodies of 12 innocent people and the police that defended them. What you did yesterday was horrible. It was morally abhorrent. It’s like blaming a rape victim for wearing the wrong sort of clothes.” Donohue followed up his appearance on the Hewitt show going toe to toe with Megyn Kelly on Fox News. Kelly also accused Donohue of blaming the victims saying, like Hewitt, it was similar to “blaming a rape victim for what she was wearing.” Donohue told Kelly the Muslims were like a wife who had been beaten by her husband for twenty years and one day kills him. Kelly pointed out the woman might have a legal defense, while the Muslims never would. Donohue told Kelly the Hebdo victims “were not brave. They were pornographers disguised as satirists, the functional equivalent of Larry Flynt.” Donohue’s non-profit has more than $25 million under management with the Christian Brothers Investment Services, a group that allegedly owns stock in distributors of hard-core pornography. Kelly read from the Supreme Court decision on the First Amendment and offensive cartoons: “The political cartoon is a weapon of attack, of scorn, of ridicule, of satire, it is usually as welcome as a bee-sting. It is always controversial, but despite their sometimes-caustic nature and graphic depiction, satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in our pubic and political debate. From the viewpoint of history it is clear our political discourse would have been considerably poorer without them.” FaithIsrael / Middle EastPoliticsBill Donohuecharlie hebdoparis shootingParis Terror Attack .

Bernie Sanders is taking his improbable campaign for the Democrat nomination into deep-red states. “We’re going to go to Alabama, we’re going to go to Mississippi, we’re going to go to conservative states,” Sanders said on CBS’s Face the Nation. A recent Sanders event in Alabama was organized by three volunteers on Facebook. The organizers said they had expected about 30 people to attend. Instead, some 300 Sanders supporters turned out to see the iconoclast politician from the Northeast. “He’s got me excited in politics again,” said supporter Peter Stuart said. “He’s not just in it for the money or his own career. To me, he’s what politicians should be.” “I think Jesus was a socialist,” Stuart added. Republicans he says, “talk Christian values and family values, but they don’t do them,” he added. Long forgotten in Presidential sweepstakes, Alabama is poised to take a larger role in the 2016 nominating contests. A number of Southern states are planning an “SEC primary,” to inject the region into the presidential contest. Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia have already set primary contests for March 1st, setting up a “super Tuesday” like contest after the Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina votes. Legislation on the Governor’s desk in Alabama would add the state to the early block of primaries. Politics . Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

        "articles": "In a brilliantly suicidal move which might well drive the last nail into the coffin of her dreams of becoming the next U.S. president, Democrat contender Hillary Clinton is angling to position herself to the left of President Obama on the fatal issues of the environment and climate change. Clinton, who has hitherto trodden carefully in this contentious and divisive territory, last week went all in with the greenies by tweeting her opinion on the subject of Arctic drilling. “The Arctic is a unique treasure. Given what we know it’s not worth the risk of drilling,” she said, in a tweet signed ‘H’. This placed her immediately at odds with her own President – coming, as it did, only a day after the Obama administration had given the go ahead for Royal Dutch Shell to explore for oil beneath the Chukchi Sea off the northeastern coast of Alaska. Some analysts have seen in this gesture an attempt to shore up the green vote while simultaneously outflanking her more left wing rivals: Clinton’s rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, primarily Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, have each staked out more liberal positions than Clinton on environmental issues. But activists say they hope Clinton will join them there soon — not just on Arctic drilling but other major topics like the Keystone XL pipeline and broader climate policy. If so then Clinton is taking an almighty gamble. On the one hand, it’s true, Clinton’s endorsement of Greenpeace’s longrunning campaign to Save The Arctic puts her in the company of some of the world’s top celebrities: Sir Paul McCartney; Sir Richard Branson; former Doctor Who David Tennant; and teen pop idol turned Occupy-style activist Charlotte Church. On the other hand, most American voters aren’t top celebrities, ardent environmentalists or enemies of economic progress. In a survey last year America emerged as the most skeptical nation on earth with regards to climate change and the environment. Still more than half of those surveyed (57 per cent) agreed with the statement: “We are heading for environmental disaster unless we change our habits quickly.” But this percentage is likely to shrink rather than grow, as more and more evidence emerges of the corruption, incompetence and cronyism of the green industry (Solyndra; Bright Source; etc); the untrustworthiness of the Establishment scientists’ doomsday predictions; and of the damage being done to the livelihoods and freedoms of ordinary Americans by increasingly oppressive green policies. Take President Obama’s plan to reduce US carbon-dioxide emissions from electricity plants by 32 per cent (from 2005 levels) by 2030. According to an analysis of Energy Information Administration data by Heritage Foundation statistician Kevin Dayaratna, this will cost global emissions by a modest two per cent – but cost the US economy up to $1 trillion in lost GDP. And, as even the Environmental Protection Agency’s administrator Gina McCarthy has admitted, the hardest hit by Obama’s Clean Power Plan will be America’s poorest. “We know that low-income minority communities would be hardest hit,” McCarthy said.

Federal data revealed to the House Committee on Homeland Security shows the Biden administration put about 7,200 border crossers on flights into the U.S. interior between February 19 to April 22, Rep. August Pfluger’s (R-TX) office confirmed to  News. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provided the data. Those 7,200 border crossers put on flights at 10 U.S. border airports by the Biden administration were allowed to bypass photo identification requirements, the standard rules all American citizens are required to abide by. Likewise, the border crossers are not required to show proof of a negative coronavirus test despite the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently confirming that border crossers in their custody are testing positive for coronavirus. “Just in the last 3 months, TSA has flown over 7,200 illegal migrants on commercial airlines without photo ID’s or a negative COVID test,” Pfluger wrote in a post online. “The Biden Admin is knowingly endangering the lives of American citizens.” Just in the last 3 months, TSA has flown over 7,200 illegal migrants on commercial airlines without photo ID's or a negative COVID test. The Biden Admin is knowingly endangering the lives of American citizens.#BidenBorderCrisis — Rep. August Pfluger (@RepPfluger) April 29, 2021 This week, a New York Times report detailed how even after border crossers test positive for the coronavirus, they are not required to quarantine by the federal government. Instead, many are skipping their quarantine and traveling into the U.S. interior with the virus. For months,  News has chronicled the Biden administration’s insistence on releasing tens of thousands of border crossers into the U.S., many of whom end up testing positive for the coronavirus afterward and keep traveling into the nation’s interior. Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the administration is creating a coronavirus crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border and potentially infecting Americans with the virus by exempting border crossers from testing and quarantine requirements Americans are subjected to.

        "articles": "Donald Trump says that if elected president, he will abolish the gun free zones currently imposed on U.S. troops by “[mandating] that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases.” In an interview with Ammoland he said: “President Clinton never should have passed a ban on soldiers being able to protect themselves on bases. America’s Armed Forces will be armed.” Trump went on to decry gun free zones on military bases as a product of “political correctness” and said removing those zones “will… [enable soldiers] to defend themselves against terrorists.” He added, “Our brave soldiers should not be at risk because of policy created by civilian leadership.” Trump’s opposition to military gun free zones is in line with his opposition to other gun control measures currently being pushed by gun control proponents like President Obama, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Gabby Giffords, and Sandy Hook Promise. Chief among these is his opposition to expanding background checks. Trump explicitly stated that he does “not support expanding background checks” because our current background check system proves such checks do not work. He added: They make it more difficult for law abiding citizens to acquire firearms while consistently failing to stop criminals from getting guns. We should re-examine our policy to make sure that these prohibitions do not impede law abiding citizens from exercising their Second Amendment rights  News has previously reported that the most prominent of public attackers over the last 15 years all passed background checks to acquire the guns they used to commit their crimes. These attackers include Dylann Roof (Charleston), Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi (Garland), Jared and Amanda Miller (Las Vegas), Elliot Rodger (Santa Barabara), Ivan Lopez (Fort Hood 2014), Darion Marcus Aguilar (Maryland mall), Karl Halverson Pierson (Arapahoe High School), Paul Ciancia (LAX), Andrew John Engeldinger (Minneapolis), Aaron Alexis (DC Navy Yard), Tennis Melvin Maynard (West Virginia), Wade Michael Page (Sinkh Temple), James Holmes (Aurora theater), Jared Loughner (Tucson), Nidal Hasan (Fort Hood 2009), Jiverly Wong (Binghamton), Seung-Hui Cho (Virginia Tech), Naveed Haq (Seattle), and Mark Barton (Atlanta). Background checks proved impotent to prevent any of these attackers from carrying out their heinous deeds but served well to make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to get the guns they need for self-defense.

        "articles": "A counter-terrorism expert believes the riots that have taken place across the country are a “coordinated effort” by Marxist and communist groups. John Guandolo singled out Antifa and Black Lives Matter as “communist organizations” during an appearance on The Kyle Olson Show, which will air on Saturday. “There are citizens who support Black Lives Matter who are in it because … they want liberty, want to make sure things are done right,” he said. “But the leadership of Black Lives Matter, the entire reason the organization was formed, it was formed as a Marxist-communist organization,” Guandolo, who was in the FBI for 13 years and founded Understanding the Threat, said. “The activities that it participates in, you’ve got to look at it through that lens.” Guandolo noted protests appear “spontaneous,” but they are “immediately violent. People are armed. We now know they’re pre-staging pallets of bricks,” and police officers have been targeted. He said he believes Antifa and Black Lives Matter are seeking to “overthrow the U.S. government.” Guandolo, a counter-terrorism expert, said Freedom Road Socialist Organization is behind what’s going on across the country, and the media is playing a role, as well. “When I sit down with senior government leaders and lay this out for them, I mean, their heads explode. And they realize this is as detailed and as ingrained here in the United States as the Islamic movement, the Jihadi movement,” he said. Guandolo asserted the feds have not been aware of the connections and no one in the federal government has been putting it together. He said Black Lives Matter wants “the anarchy. They want the chaos. What they’re doing on the streets today is communist doctrine, because when the chaos happens, then, what you get is a need for law and order and communism is a system that brings order to the community.” Guandolo praised President Trump for calling Antifa “terrorists.” “This is a war in the information battle space,” and he said Trump uttering those words was a “big deal.” Guandolo said he believes Trump and others in the federal government are starting to understand the seriousness of the stakes. “The President is starting to see how these things are connected,” he said. According to Guandolo, when he left the FBI for the Department of Defense, he was responsible for briefing generals, attorneys general, members of Congress, and others. “Not a one of them understood anything about the U.S. communist movement,” he said. Speaking about the radical organizations, Guandolo said, “Their goal is to control the narrative, to control how our leaders understand what they’re doing.” “When you tell someone in the government that Black Lives Matter is a Marxist-communist movement as a matter of objective fact, they just don’t know this,” he said. “And then of course they’re like, ‘Well, why are we meeting with them?’ That’s my question.” “‘Sir, why are you meeting with them? Why are you giving them legitimacy?’” Guandolo said. Kyle Olson is a reporter for  News. He is also host of “The Kyle Olson Show,” syndicated on Michigan radio stations on Saturdays.

        "articles": "In a frightening sign of how even the youngest of children can now be exploited by gender-confused fanatics, six-year-old Devina Keswani—originally named Dev and born male but now assuming the role of female—is starring in a new web series created for People.com: The Keswanis: A Most Modern Family. The prototypical 21st century American family, the Keswanis include Big Nik, the 17-year-old star on Vine who suffers from dwarfism; Sarina, 15, the shy teenager learning to pose in a bikini for beauty pageants; Anil, the father who is a doctor; and Vaishali, the mom. The parents live in a world all their own—in the third episode of the series, Vaishali insists, “The day Dev could walk, the walk was feminine. The day Dev could talk, it was really feminine.” Anil boasts, “We had this perfect kid.” Then he adds, “But it wasn’t easy. There was something that was not clicking.” A kindergarten teacher set the parents straight, telling them that one of the child’s assignments indicated something might be awry. The parents then discussed the situation with their kindergarten child. According to People, “the family realized they couldn’t deny Devina’s true self any longer.” Vaishali hardly hesitated; “It took me about 30 seconds to take that in. I just wrapped my arms around her and said ‘You will never have to be Dev again, ever.'” Now Devina hangs out with “peers,” such as Lily Rubenstein, a transgender 15-year-old. Rubenstein pontificated, “Family support is the number one way to ensure that your child will have a happy and healthy transition. The Keswanis are setting the example here. Because of their support, Devina has been able to live a happy and authentic life. There is nothing better than being able to do that.” Devina claims in the series that a transgenderphobic boy bullied Devina. The child has also joined the Girl Scouts. In the series, Devina plans to speak at school about transgenderism. Meanwhile, Anil attended a photoshoot for Sarina, claiming he felt uncomfortable when she was told to be “young sexy.” Vaishali admits, “That is not your normal American family. It’s not necessarily how we envisioned our life to be, but it’s a life that’s so full and rich.” EntertainmentMediaLGBTPeople MagazineTransgender .

Ted Yoho (R-FL) stated that the United States isn’t doing enough with regards to Taiwan and previewed legislation that he will introduce to authorize military force if China invades Taiwan. Yoho said, “With South Korea and Japan and the United States, we’re doing enough. That trilateral arrangement, that agreement between those three countries, that is one of the strongest relationships in national security. Are we doing enough with Taiwan? No. Since Henry Kissinger’s days and forward, there’s been strategic ambiguity about our policies between Taiwan and China. We are introducing a bill next week, and it’s going to be called the Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act, and this is something that’s going to lay very clear what our intent is. In fact, it’ll go to the point where it authorizes an AUMF if China invades Taiwan, and it’ll be a sunset for five years, that AUMF, that would authorize the president to use force. Right now, our agreement, and this came out of Ronald Reagan’s presidency, is that we would sell Taiwan enough weapons for them to defend themselves. But when Xi Jinping has announced that he’s ready to draw blood over Taiwan and reunify them, they forgot to ask Taiwan.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett ClipsPoliticsChinaTaiwanTed Yoho .

        "articles": "Global warming is making children shorter, according to scientists at John Hopkins University and Bloomberg School of Medicine. They say that children born in Peru during the El Niño event of 1997-98 were on average shorter and smaller, which they attribute to a poorer diet thanks to flooding and other catastrophic climate events. But others have pointed out that simply allowing Peru to become an industrialised country would mitigate the problem. The study, snappily titled El Niño adversely affected childhood stature and lean mass in northern Peru, which is authored by eight scientists from the two institutions, looked at height for age in Peruvian children born between 1991 and 1997, and then at height for age for children born within the El Niño event of 1997/98. They found that “Children born during and after 1997-1998 El Niño were on average shorter and had less lean mass for their age and sex than expected had El Niño not occurred,” and concluded that “The effects of El Niño on health are long lasting and, given its cyclical nature, may continue to negatively impact future generations.” They attributed the difference to a poorer diet brought about by flooding during El Niño. However, Eric Worrall, who highlighted the report on climate blog site Watts Up With That comments “Of course, if Peru had a modern, rich, industrial economy, perhaps the Peruvian people could afford enough food, so they wouldn’t suffer nutritional shortages when floodwater messed up the household cabbage patch. But this would require evil infusions of large scale commercial investment – an unlikely prospect, given the local Peruvian political climate.” The political nature of climate change claims has long been noted. In 1998 Christine Stewart, the former Canadian Environment Minister said “No matter if the science is all phoney, there are collateral environmental benefits.” In another interview shortly afterwards she went on to explain further: “climate change [provides] the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world.” Nearly 6,000 people died thanks to flooding in the north Indian state of Uttarakhand in June 2013, thanks to mudslides and collapsed infrastructure. A further 3,000 were killed by flooding in eastern India in 2004, and 2,400 thanks to monsoon rains in 2008. By comparison, the only flooding event in the Western world since the year 2000 was the New Orleans levee disaster of 2005, in which 69 people lost their lives. The evidence shows that the best protection against natural disaster is economic development, which allows countries to build flood defences, reinforced buildings, medical care and food stores. In the conclusion to his book Let Them Eat Carbon, Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers’ Alliance commented “Instead of trying to control emissions by rationing energy and thereby limiting economic growth, we should bet on more growth and human ingenuity. “Most importantly [we should] go for growth to produce more resilient societies better able to respond to whatever the world throws at them.” London / EuropeClimate ChangeGlobal Warming .

        "articles": "R&B singer The Weeknd and rapper Belly cancelled their scheduled performance on Thursday’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live because Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is also set to appear on the show that night. “To play my part in this business is a privilege and a beautiful thing.” the Palestinian-born, Canada-based Belly told the Associated Press. “The fact that I could lose that ability through the actions of someone such as Donald Trump isn’t right to me. At all.” Belly, born Ahmad Balshe, was set to perform his hit single “Might Not” alongside fellow Canadian singer The Weekend. In the song, the 32-year-old MC raps about promiscuous women sending him naked pictures, doing drugs and “gettin’ hoes higher.” Hippy bitches sendin’ me titty pictures She told me no religion was the new religion She said she don’t believe in God but her shoes Christian I heard she servin’ everybody like the soup kitchen Gettin’ hoes higher, gettin’ hoes higher She got work in the mornin’, I’m gettin’ hoes fired Why the f*ck you call it purp when you mix it pink? You know I f*ckin’ mix the drinks when the sh*t’s too strong “I’m here on a campaign of positivity and love and to contribute what I can to music,” Belly’s statement said. “I create songs people go to sleep and wake up to, songs that they fall in love to. For me, being Muslim and being somebody that appreciates my access here in America, I love the fact that I’m able to be here.” “I feel like the way I was raised was to be able to see through all the titles in this world—from religion to race,” he added. “I just didn’t want to feel like I was a part of a celebration for somebody who has beliefs that majority of us don’t agree with,” the rapper said of Trump, who has called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration.

        "articles": "On  News Sunday, one of the country’s top GOP pollsters warned Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to be careful in the coming months because Americans, especially Republicans, have a lower opinion of him than outgoing House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH). Liz Sheld of Red Revolver Strategies and Pat Caddell Associates conducted a poll (63.5% of those polled were Republicans, 30.2% identified as “independents” or “other,” and 6.4% were Democrats) before Boehner announced his resignation that found that 50% of Americans want a new Senate Majority Leader. Sheld said some aspects of the poll were worse for McConnell than it was for Boehner because McConnell was less popular than the outgoing House Speaker. “If I were McConnell, I would be careful right now,” Sheld told host and  News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125. As Republicans search for a new Speaker in the coming weeks, there may be more pressure put on McConnell from grassroots conservatives who have been fed up with a Republican leadership that too often ignores their concerns. Already, Louisiana Governor and 2016 GOP presidential candidate Bobby Jindal has called on McConnell to resign. So has Roger Villere, the Louisiana GOP Chairman and Republican National Committee’s vice chairman, who said that McConnell is hurting Republicans “tremendously with our elections.” Sheld said the poll also found that voters believe the Republican leadership is more interested in doing the bidding of the Chamber of Commerce, corporations and lobbyists than standing up for for the rank and file GOP voter. And the poll found that two-thirds of Americans believed that Washington in general is more responsive to to lobbyists, big businesses, and special interests than the average Joe. She also mentioned that the poll showed that Americans are not buying the litany of excuses the GOP establishment has made since 2010–like not having the presidency–for not fighting for what they promised on the campaign trail. Sheld pointed out that when Democrats did not control the presidency or Congress, “they managed to make some progress on their front” and fought for their principles. She said Republicans should have at least tried to stand firm against defunding Obama’s executive amnesty and repealing Obamacare instead of not even trying because “Obama will never sign it.” In the poll, 64% of respondents answered, “I am disappointed with the performance of the Republican leadership in Congress, they are not living up to their promises on issues like immigration and Obamacare, upon which they were elected” Sheld said voters are tired of a GOP leadership that doesn’t bother to put up a fight against Obama’s agenda and she mentioned that though Republicans regained control of Congress by running against Obamacare and Obama’s executive amnesty, the GOP leadership decided the day after wining the 2014 midterm elections that “we can’t do anything because Obama is the President.” Politics .

I unveil the ties between Todd and Democratic campaigns in my explosive new book, Breaking the News: Exposing the Establishment Media’s Hidden Deals and Secret Corruptions. After Klobuchar’s campaign announcement, Todd offered viewers his analysis of Klobuchar’s candidacy. Her biggest asset, according to Todd? “Location, location, location.” According to Page Six, which first reported the relationship, Klobuchar and her husband paid the Todds $3,200 a month. This relationship went undisclosed for years, even though Todd went on to question Klobuchar at least eight times on-air during her 2020 campaign, including as the moderator of two of the primary debates: This was not Todd’s only financial connection to Democratic campaigns. His wife, Kristian Denny, is a Democratic campaign consultant. According to OpenSecrets, Denny’s firm, Maverick Strategies, was paid over $900,000 by the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2020 and over $1.5 million from Sanders in 2016, among many examples.

        "articles": "Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-NY) took to social media Wednesday and announced, “Supreme Court expansion is infrastructure,” shortly after news emerged Democrats intend to roll out a court-packing bill this week to increase justices from nine to 13. Such an untraditional sentiment was shared by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), who also claimed paid leave, child care, and caregiving are “infrastructure” related items to include in future infrastructure legislation. Paid leave is infrastructure. Child care is infrastructure. Caregiving is infrastructure. — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) April 7, 2021 Supreme Court expansion is infrastructure. — Mondaire Jones (@MondaireJones) April 15, 2021 Yes  — Mondaire Jones (@MondaireJones) April 15, 2021 Unsurprisingly, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on April 13 said the Democrats’ attempt to spin unrelated infrastructure items into an infrastructure bill was a tactic to change the English language. “Instead of coming up with a better bill, Democrats have decided it’s the English language that needs to change. They are embarking on an Orwellian campaign to convince everybody that any government policy whatsoever can be labeled infrastructure,” McConnell said. ’s Joel B. Pollak reported Wednesday night, “Congressional Democrats plan to unveil legislation expanding the size of the Supreme Court on Thursday, according to three congressional sources familiar with the closely held measure.” The court-packing bill, captained by House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA), and Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-NY), would expand the court from nine justices to 13 in a move widely applauded by left-wing groups. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki declined to defend U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer on Friday from attacks by left-wing groups that say he should resign because he is opposed to packing the Court with additional justices.  —  News (@News) April 9, 2021 While Congress has expanded the federal courts based on caseload, “some contend that expanding the Court with the intent to shape the Court’s composition and obtain more favorable case outcomes [for the president] may raise constitutional questions,” according to the Congressional Research Service. Indeed, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s attempt to expand the Supreme Court for political reasons was opposed by Congress and historians, seen “as a crude power grab” and “one that ultimately convinced the Court to stop striking down his New Deal legislation and to allow government powers to grow,”  reported.

        "articles": "Most Democratic voters say that they believe former President Barack Obama was a better president than founding father and first U.S. president George Washington, according to a recent poll. The Monmouth University poll found that 63 percent of Democrats thought that Obama was a better president than Washington. Only 29 percent of those polled thought that Washington was better than the 44th president. Out of all the registered voters surveyed, 58 percent said Washington was a better president than Obama, who had 33 percent supporting him. Compared to President Donald Trump, Washington got 71 percent support, while only 15 percent thought Trump was a better president than the founding father. Among Republicans, 44 percent of them said Washington was a better president than Trump, while 37 percent said Trump is a better president than Washington. The founding father beat out both modern-day presidents among independents, with 72 percent who say he is better than Trump and 62 percent who say he is better than Obama. Patrick Murray, who serves as the director of Monmouth University’s polling institute, said that there could be “a combination of factors at work” with a polling question like this. “Democrats may be more likely than Republicans to be influenced by recency bias, valuing what they are familiar with over historical opinion,” Murray said. “It’s a fun question to ask, but I’m not sure what it means.” The following poll was “inspired” by another recent survey which asked respondents whether Trump or Abraham Lincoln was a better “Republican president.” The poll, conducted by the Economist/YouGov, found that 53 percent of voters favored Trump as a leader over Lincoln while 47 percent of respondents chose the Civil War-era leader over Trump. The Monmouth poll was conducted by phone between December 4 and December 8, and surveyed 903 adults, with polling results based on 838 registered voters.

        "articles": "House Minority leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi today described Donald Trump’s popular immigration principles as “trash” and as “brutal” towards illegal immigrants, despite repeated election results showing that voters want migration policies to be fair to ordinary Americans. Pelosi spoke Wednesday, saying Trump’s immigration principles are unacceptable to illegal immigrants, which she dubbed ‘dreamers’: They call them principles — unprinciples! — they are not principles, they are trash — are unacceptable to the dreamers and those of us who fight for them. Democratic legislators at the Capitol Hill event insisted they would not compromise on their opposition to the principles, released October 8. “We stand against these immigration principles — from the wall to not supporting refugees [or the] immigration principles already standard in this country,” said the chairwoman of the Hispanic Caucus, New Mexico Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham. “We reject them all — they are not part of any negotiations.”  The press event spotlighted the Democrats’ high-low coalition of financial elites and government-dependent people, and it excluded any mention of middle-class Americans’ worries about getting displaced or outsourced by the federal government’s high-immigration, low-wage economic strategy. For example, the event was organized by a lobbying group for Venture Capitalists, FWD.us, and it featured several illegal immigrants, including one Spanish-speaking illegal who spoke in broken English, even though she has been in the United States since 2000. Pelosi’s repeated declarations of concern for illegal immigrants was not matched by any statement of support for Americans, either as young students, as job seekers, employees, parents, or as taxpayers. She argued Trump’s pro-American plans are unpopular, even though numerous polls and elections show that Americans do not want other Americans to be sidelined by cheap-labor immigration. Polls show that Trump’s policies are popular because they try to balance Americans’ concerns about mass-immigration with Americans’ generous offer of citizenship to foreign immigrants. Those fairness policies are particularly supported in the Midwest — which flipped from Democratic to Trump in November 2016 — but are opposed by business groups which gain from additional lower-wage workers and welfare-aided consumers. The political power of Trump’s immigration fairness argument was noted by veteran Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg.“Progressives will only get an audience with these voters if they listen to them and understand why they were desperate for sweeping changes, why they voted for Trump and what message they were sending to the elites about putting ‘us’ and America first,” said his March 2017 autopsy report. In 2016, former President Barack Obama pushed a pro-immigration policy, even as the federal government invited another 1 million foreigners to immigrate into the United States, just as four million young Americans began looking for decent jobs. Regardless of Greenberg’s analysis, Pelosi repeated her claim that immigrants — not Americans’ children — are keeping the nation invigorated: Every Republican president for the past four decades has recognized the [immigrants’] constant reinvigoration of America. Look at Ronald Reagan … and George Herbert Walker Bush … George W. Bush tried so hard. In 2013, Pelosi declared that immigrants are more American than Americans, saying: “In coming here with those American traits, all of the immigrants make America more American.” On Wednesday, Pelosi argued that mass immigration cannot be reduced without destroying the nature of America, saying Trump’s principles: are anathema to our national values. Together, these brutal proposals – each one of them is horrible – but the cumulative effect of them would destroy a fundamental part of the American character – a free nation proud of an immigrant heritage. It abandons — their proposal abandons the fundamental respect for family at the heart of our faith, at the heart of who we are as Americans. Protecting our dreamers and respecting our immigrant families unites us, and unites the three Bs – business, badges — our law enforcement friends — and bibles — our religious voters. Pelosi’s concern for illegal immigrants, rather than for Americans, was shared by other speakers at the Capitol Hill event. Trump’s immigration principles are “literally a love letter to white supremacists,” said Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal, an immigrant from Indian immigrant and a former activist lauded by Obama’s White House. The goal of the principles “is really to end our deep history of immigration,” she said, even though Trump’s principles only call for a reduction in the variety of relatives that can be brought into the United States via chain-migration. Deporting the illegal-immigrant parents of young illegal immigrants “is outrageous and unacceptable,” she said, before declaring that mass immigration is essential to the identity of ordinary Americans. “Immigration has never been just about immigration — immigration always been about who we are a country, and what we are willing to stand up for.” Grisham also said the border wall is a symbolic effort to distinguish the United States from other countries; the wall is bad for trade, bad for the economy, bad for the environment, bad for species migration, it is bad, and it is completely wasteful and it is part of a — in my opinion, my statement — hateful rhetoric intended to divide this country and to divide us from other nations. She insisted that immigration “is good for our economy, it is good for our schools, it is good for our neighborhoods … [and amnesty] is the right thing to do for these young men and women who have done so much for their families, neighborhoods and this country.” The young illegals seeking amnesty are “800,00 young people who are engineers and doctors or studying to be doctors and lawyers, or who do military service or law enforcement,” she said, without mentioning the many illegals who lack even a high-school education, and without mentioning the 4 million young American men and women who enter the workforce each year. The House and the Senate are “working very hard to do right by dreamers and right by the American economy, both,” Grisham said, without mentioning the economic hopes of ordinary Americans. Democrats, said Pelosi, want “a victory for dreamers in a way that does not harm any other immigrants in our country.” Four million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market. But business groups have used their political power to tilt the labor market in their favor, via the federal policy of importing 1 million consumers and workers each year. The government also hands out almost 3 million short-term work permits to foreign workers. These permits include roughly 330,000 one-year OPT permits for foreign graduates of U.S. colleges, roughly 200,000 three-year H-1B visas for foreign white-collar professionals, and 400,000 two-year permits to DACA illegals. Universities employ roughly 100,000 foreign guest workers. That Washington-imposed economic policy of mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions. The cheap-labor policy has also reduced investment and job creation in many interior states because the coastal cities have a surplus of imported labor. For example, almost 27 percent of zip codes in Missouri had fewer jobs or businesses in 2015 than in 2000, according to a new report by the Economic Innovation Group. In Kansas, almost 29 percent of zip codes had fewer jobs and businesses in 2015 compared to 2000, which was a two-decade period of massive cheap-labor immigration. Americans tell pollsters that they strongly oppose amnesties and cheap-labor immigration, even as most Americans also want to favor legal immigrants, and many sympathize with illegals. Because of the successful cheap-labor strategy, wages for men have remained flat since 1973, and a growing percentage of the nation’s annual income is shifting to investors and away from employees. The business-funded Hamilton Project suggests that the shift is transferring $1 trillion per year from 160 million employees to the nation’s investors.

        "articles": "Online source code repository and team collaboration service GitHub has been under fire after an anti-white agenda was revealed within the company’s “Social Impact Team.” According to Tech Insider’s reveal on GitHub’s current situation, CEO Chris Wanstrath is radically changing the company. The former flat structure that eliminated substantial hierarchy has been replaced with supervisors and middle managers, and the ability for employees to work remotely has been cut back in favour of mandatory office working environments. These changes have prompted many long-term employees to leave, with some reportedly being ousted if they cannot meet the new requirements. GitHub’s Social Impact Team, which is “in charge of figuring out how to use the product to tackle social issues” has also faced heavy criticism. Headed by diversity consultant Nicole Sanchez, the team’s previous achievements include working with the White House to fit “low-income homes” with free Wi-Fi around the country, but the team is now focused on diversifying the company’s workforce. “It is very hard to even interview people who are ‘white,’” claimed an anonymous GitHub employee speaking to Tech Insider. It’s a claim that seems shocking but should come as no surprise considering Sanchez’s previous outspoken statements on diversity. In February 2015, Sanchez wrote an article for USA Today entitled “More white women does not equal tech diversity,” and during a diversity training talk Sanchez even stated that technology was “not work for white folks to lead” and that “some of the biggest barriers to progress are white women.” Danilo Campos, the technical director at GitHub’s Social Impact Team, is also no stranger to controversial comments about race. “Don’t think we’ll succeed teaching white, male middle managers empathy and compassion anytime soon.

        "articles": "A bipartisan group of lawmakers has banded together, urging President Donald Trump to sign into law the historic War Powers Resolution that hit his desk on Thursday and reject a push from globalist forces for him to veto it. The Democrat-led House of Representatives on Thursday joined the GOP-led U.S. Senate in passing a War Powers Resolution for the first time in the nation’s history on the U.S. role in backing Saudi Arabia’s coalition in Yemen’s civil war, sending a War Powers Resolution to the desk of a president. The War Powers Act passed into law over a presidential veto from then-President Richard Nixon–Congress overrode Nixon’s veto amid national anxiety with war in the wake of the lengthy and unpopular Vietnam War in 1973. It aimed to restrict the powers of the president and keep war-making authority where the founding fathers intended it when they gave that power to Congress in Article I of the U.S. Constitution. Never since has either chamber of Congress passed a War Powers Resolution reining in the president’s war-making powers since 1973’s passage of the law over Nixon’s veto, until now: Both the House and Senate have passed the War Powers Resolution with regard to the United States’ role in backing Saudi Arabia’s coalition in Yemen’s civil war. The U.S. involvement, which began illegally under now former President Barack Obama’s administration and has continued–though it has been somewhat rolled back–under the Trump administration, has encompassed refueling of Saudi bomber jets, targeting assistance, and other U.S. actions in the war that have not received approval from Congress. In the beginning of 2018, a nonpartisan grassroots coalition of unlikely allies from both the right and the left came together to push for a War Powers Resolution reining in the executive branch on the Yemen civil war. The first go-around was unsuccessful in the Senate, but later in 2018, after the midterm elections, the Senate succeeded in passing the measure backed by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a Vermont Independent who caucuses with Democrats, Mike Lee (R-UT), and Chris Murphy (D-CT). In 2019, the effort passed again. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), another leading force behind the effort and a top ally of President Trump, said in an interview with  News that it was an “extraordinary moment” when it passed the Senate because Congress had never passed anything like this before. Much of this same loosely-aligned nonpartisan coalition, which Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) has also been leading as he laid out in an interview with  News this week, has been backing Trump’s efforts to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan and to negotiate for peace with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Now that the bill is on its way to Trump’s desk, the president is presented with a unique choice on this front. He could veto it, as many in the establishment seem to be pushing for him to do, or he could buck the D.C. establishment and sign the bill into law–which would be yet another historic win for the coalition that has against all odds turned American foreign policy on its head in just over a year. Trump has vetoed one bill so far as president: an effort by Congress to roll back his emergency declaration on the U.S. border with Mexico. Congress failed to overturn his veto. While he has used the veto before, as have other presidents, no president ever has ever signed a War Powers Resolution into law. Trump, who likes to be first and historic, would be able to say–if he embraces this bill and signs it–that he was the first president in U.S. history to ever sign anything like it into law. Politically speaking, it would be very popular in his re-election as well, as this issue–ending endless wars–was a central theme of his 2016 campaign and is a central theme of many of his potential opponents in 2020. Several congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle–including Republicans and top Trump allies like Sen. Paul and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)–have signed a letter to President Trump on Thursday urging him to sign this bill into law. The lawmakers wrote to Trump: As a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers, we respectfully ask you to sign into law Senate Joint Resolution 7, which invokes the War Powers Act of 1973 to end unauthorized U.S. military participation in the Saudi-led coalition’s armed conflict against Yemen’s Houthi forces, initiated in 2015 by the Obama Administration. The passage of this landmark legislation would help advance the aims of your December 6, 2017 directive, which requested that Saudi Arabia “completely allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it.” Unfortunately, the Saudi-led coalition’s imposition of an air-land-and-sea blockade as part of its war against Yemen’s Houthis has continued to prevent the unimpeded distribution of these vital commodities, contributing to the suffering and death of vast numbers of civilians throughout the country. Senate Joint Resolution 7 codifies your administration’s November 2018 decision to halt midair refueling operations for Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, and terminates other unauthorized hostilities initiated by the Obama Administration, such as targeting assistance. The legislation under your consideration for presidential signature has no bearing on U.S. weapons sales to the Saudi Kingdom. We believe the signing of this bill into law would send a powerful signal to the Saudi-led coalition to bring the four-year-old war to a close, thereby ending the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, which has pushed 10 million Yemenis to the brink of famine. They argue in the letter that Trump could reject the “resistance” within his administration by “some of your subordinates” who are working against him regularly if he backs this new pathway forward. “Both during your campaign and presidency, you have spoken out against a bipartisan tendency to be drawn into costly and never-ending conflicts across the globe and its devastating impacts for American service members and taxpayers,” the group of members who signed the letter wrote to Trump on Thursday. “You have also expressed public frustration over the resistance by some of your subordinates within the Executive Branch to your efforts to challenge this consensus.” The members also woite that if Trump signs this bill into law instead of listening to the globalists pushing him to veto it, he would see a “new precedent for cooperation” among both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill in “both chambers of Congress.” In other words, especially among the Democrat signers of this letter, they are saying if Trump rejects the globalists on this and stands on principle with those pushing to end the Yemen war he would gain an enormous amount of respect from even Democrats willing to work with him on this and perhaps many other issues. For a president who has been mired in investigation after investigation, this could be music to his ears: He’s now got a shot at working in good faith with Democrats on an issue set they largely agree on: ending endless foreign wars. The letter continued: We believe that by signing this historic legislation to terminate an unconstitutional war that predates your presidency, you will set a new precedent for cooperation with both chambers of Congress to overcome such entrenched opposition to foreign-policy restraint,” the letter continued. We also hope that such a partnership between the President and Congress to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led coalition’s war against Yemen’s Houthis can serve as a bipartisan springboard to achieve our shared interest in responsibly drawing down needless conflicts throughout the world, such as ongoing U.S. military interventions in Afghanistan and Syria. The members conclude by asking Trump for a meeting as soon as possible to discuss this matter. “We respectfully ask for a meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss this legislation and the promising opportunities that can emerge from its passage,” the members wrote. Signers of this latest letter include Khanna, Lee, Paul, Gaetz, Sanders, and Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), and Thomas Massie (R-KY). While several in the media have suggested Trump may veto the bill, the New York Times reported on Thursday evening that it is thus far unclear whether Trump will. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), the Democratic lawmaker who organized this letter, said in a quote provided to  News that he is hopeful the president will stick with his instincts on war like he’s doing with Afghanistan and Syria and sign this bill into law. “Famine is not an inevitability – it can and it must be prevented before it gets any worse,” Khanna said. “This is a letter sent in good faith, and I’m hopeful the president recognizes that this is a humanitarian issue, like he has done in Syria and Afghanistan, rather than a political one.” Khanna previously conducted an exclusive interview with  News on this topic, in which he openly pushed for a bipartisan meeting to work with Trump on these matters. Presumably, if such a meeting happened, signers of this letter are just some of the Democrats who would be willing to work with the president on this front.

        "articles": "According to the new book Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets, Capitol Hill staffers use private dedicated phone lines set up just for members of Congress when booking lawmakers’ flights. Airlines also allow politicians to reserve seats on multiple flights but only pay for the trips they actually take. “They are treated completely differently from the time they book their ticket until the time they land at the airport,” Kate Hanni, director of Flyers Rights, told Roll Call. Members of Congress also enjoy free parking courtesy of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. In fact, Washington’s Dulles International Airport has 97 reserved spaces just for members of Congress. Reagan National has 89 special parking spots. The author of the book, Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer, says airlines extend the congressional perks to keep lawmakers happy–and at bay. “Why do airlines pamper them?” writes Schweizer. “Precisely because they know that getting on the wrong side of the Permanent Political Class can cause their industry serious problems.” In Extortion, Schweizer challenges the commonly accepted assumption that outside forces seek to bribe and strong arm Washington politicians. The reality is exactly the reverse, argues Schweizer. Politicians induce fear using legislative tactics to extort rich industries and individuals into making large campaign donations that are often then converted into funds that can be funneled to a politician’s friends or family members. “Washington’s Permanent Political Class does not live and play by the same rules you and I do,” said Schweizer in an interview with  News. “The things that would send us to jail are simply ‘another day at the office’ for Washington politicians.” PoliticsCapitol HillCongress .

Mitchell said, “The party has moved. This is — it reminds me of 1972, actually. And she has lost the base. And she’s lost the women. And that is what is so stunning here in New Hampshire.

        "articles": "HOUSTON, Texas – Armed Black Panther members marched in front of the Waller County jail and shouted, “You’re gonna stop doing what you’re doing, or we will start creeping up on you in the darkness.” The statement was made just two weeks prior to the assassination of a Harris County deputy sheriff. Shannon Miles, a black male, allegedly came “creeping up” behind Harris County Deputy Darren Goforth in the darkness on the night of August 28. While Goforth stood at a convenience store pumping gas into his patrol vehicle, Miles allegedly raised a pistol and shot him dead. The comments, made by a leader of the Houston-based chapter of the New Black Panther Party, were captured on a short video clip (below) from the scene by the Houston Chronicle. The writers from the Chronicle made no mention of the threat in their article published that same day. Not part of a chant, the march leader, wearing the rank of colonel, shouted directly to Harris County mounted deputies through a megaphone. “You think we’re not pissed off a bunch about y’all killing our sisters? You think it’s okay? [We’re] the wrong n***ers to mess with. You’re gonna stop doing what you’re doing, or we will start creeping up on you in the darkness.” The rally, also covered by  Texas, took place at the Waller County Jail where inmate Sandra Bland took her own life by hanging herself with a trash bag after her arrest following a traffic stop in the town of Prairie View. She was accused of an illegal lane change and assaulting a police officer. After being left in jail by her family for three days, Bland hung herself. In the video below,  Texas recorded several other violent statements towards police. “The revolution is on… Off the pigs,” and “Oink Oink… Bang Bang!,” was the message leveled by the heavily armed Black Panthers directly at Harris County deputies who had been asked by the Waller County Sheriff to come out to help keep the peace. Two weeks later, a black man, Shannon Miles, allegedly walked up behind Deputy Goforth and shot him in the head and back fifteen times, according to a  Texas report on Miles’ first court appearance. The Waller County jail is located just over 30 miles from the Chevron station where Goforth was executed. The alleged killer, Shannon Miles, also attended the same university as Sandra Bland. It is possible that her arrest and subsequent suicide could have played a role in Miles’ possible motivation. Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for  Texas.

        "articles": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, lamented in a Tuesday interview with Chelsea Clinton that the “phenomenal amount of hostility” that he endures is “astounding.” “I’ve been the object myself of a phenomenal amount of hostility merely because I’m promoting what’re really fundamental simple public health principles,” Fauci, who also serves as the White House’s chief coronavirus advisor, stated on the In Fact with Chelsea Clinton podcast. “That seems astounding that that would generate a considerable degree of hostility, but it is.” Fauci made the remark when asked about how to rebuild trust in science in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The longtime government official later conceded that the solution to rebuilding public trust is elusive to him. He said: I don’t know the answer to your question. It’s a seemingly simple question, but a complicated answer. We’ve got to reach out to people and get them to understand that this is for their own safety, their own health and also what I refer to as communal responsibility, your responsibility to society. Recently released emails have shined new light on Fauci’s actions as the pandemic began to unfold in the U.S., putting the infectious disease expert’s handling of the public health crisis under the microscope. Namely, Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) have expressed concerns over Fauci’s approach to responding to queries about the Wuhan lab’s possible connection to the virus. Hawley told the Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson Tonight on Thursday: Well, I think because we’ve seen the media line, which Dr. Fauci has, unfortunately, promoted over and over, which is the idea that the Wuhan lab was involved in COVID-19 in a way was false, that’s what they’ve said over and over. You’re a conspiracy theorist, they said. Dr. Fauci has said, you know, this was a naturally originating virus. We shouldn’t ask questions. It turns out, Tucker, there are a lot of really legitimate questions, and I mean, a lot of really legitimate questions about the involvement, the potential involvement of a lab. We need to get to the bottom of it. Dr. Fauci, by the way, knew very well. His emails tell us he knew in January of 2020 that there was a possible lab connection there. Of course, he also knew about his connection to gain-of-function research at that same lab, and yet he was dishonest about it and continues to be dishonest about it. That’s a big problem. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) went a step further this week and demanded that the White House fire Fauci from his position. “What we also know is Dr. Fauci was running a PR campaign. He was not giving the American people accurate scientific information. He was cherry-picking different facts to help him in a PR campaign. So maybe he should leave his post and go work for an ad agency to try to do PR campaigns,” Blackburn said. HealthPoliticsScienceAnthony FauciChelsea ClintonJosh HawleyMarsha BlackburnWuhan Lab .

        "articles": "This column is sponsored by my kind friends at ExxonMobil: the Gaia-raping, children-of-the-future-murderers you can trust! No, of course it isn’t really and that’s my only serious beef with ExxonMobil. It ought to support its media defenders but it doesn’t. So what if it’s a big oil company? Big oil companies make the world go round. So what if its annual revenues, if expressed in GDP, would make it one of the world’s 30 largest countries? That’s capitalism. But there’s one thing about ExxonMobil I find hard to excuse. And that’s the way that instead of trying to defend the values of industrial civilization which have made it so rich and powerful, it has instead all too often squandered its PR, CSR and research budgets not rewarding its friends but giving succour to its enemies. Sure for a period it supported the Competitive Enterprise Institute to the modest tune of around $300,000 a year. (Not a lot when your annual profits can be as much as $40 billion). But the money it has given to liberal causes vastly outweighs anything it has given to free market ones: for example the $100 million (yes that’s million, not thousand) it donated to Stanford in 2002 to help launch its Global Climate and Energy Project. Some might call this ‘investment in the future’. I’d call it greenwashing. Or, worse than that, Danegeld. It’s a form of protection money paid to the green Mafia to ensure they go easy on your main business. Except they don’t. Just like the Vikings, just like the mobsters, when you bribe them to stay away they only keep coming back for more. This is the background context against we should judge the outrageous and iniquitous proposals by various green activists that ExxonMobil should face prosecution on RICO charges for having knowingly concealed “the truth” about climate change. These activists include Sharon Eubanks, a former US Department of Justice attorney who once helped bring a similar case against Big Tobacco; House Democrats Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier; Canadian eco-loon Bill McKibben (who talks, with characteristic wry understatement, of Exxon’s “sheer, profound, and – I think – unparalleled evil”); and, of course, Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, another attorney determined to use lawfare to shut down the debate on climate change once and for all. Their claims are based on two articles which appeared in the liberal media and which – at least in the authors’ perfervid imaginations – showed Exxon ignoring its scientists in the 70s, 80s and 90s and setting out deliberately to conceal “the truth” about global warming. Well I’ve read the articles – one at the Inside Climate News website, the other at the LA Times – and both are a classic case of what you might call “tell not show.” That is, it is clear from their accusatory tone (“What Exxon knew about Earth’s melting Arctic”; “top executives were warned of possible catastrophe from greenhouse effect, then led efforts to block solutions”) that the authors believe Exxon was guilty of something seriously amiss. But in vain do you search the body of the text for any damning evidence that might justify all this righteous rage. In fact if anything, Exxon emerges from this non-scandal rather well: socially responsible; mindful of due diligence; properly concerned about the security and future of its core business and of the needs of its shareholders; keen to keep abreast of the latest science. The story goes like this: from the late 70s to the mid 80s, Exxon dedicated a chunk of its then-annual $300 million research budget looking into the effects of CO2 and the possible risks of man-made global warming. “Present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to ten years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical,” said one of its technical experts in 1978. “There are some potentially catastrophic events that must be considered” an in house corporate primer said in 1982. “Once the effects are measurable, they might not be reversible.” “Models are controversial,” as their head of theoretical sciences was honest enough to put it in a May 1980 status report on Exxon’s climate modelling programme. “Therefore, there are research opportunities for us.” All this is no more than you would have expected scientists in that field to say in that particular era, as man-made-global-warming theory was becoming increasingly fashionable. By raising these issues, they were simply doing their job. Note, however, the caution of their phrasing. “Present thinking holds”; “might”; “potentially”; “might not be.” The science wasn’t certain and neither were the scientists: they were merely raising Exxon’s awareness of possible future scenarios. What’s more, even though this fashionable new theory was detrimental to Exxon’s business model, Exxon still – to its enormous moral credit – chose to publish its research anyway in a series of papers and monographs. Then in the mid-Eighties, Exxon began changing its tune. Its discretionary budget had been hit by the collapsing oil price and it had, perhaps, begun to recognise that the science on global warming was being manipulated by hucksters like NASA’s James Hansen and climate activist Senator Tim Wirth and that fossil fuel producers were now their public enemy number one – for reasons more to do with green ideology than science. In 1997, Exxon’s chairman and CEO Lee Raymond was among business leaders who argued successfully against America’s adoption of the Kyoto Protocol. He said: “Let’s agree there’s a lot we really don’t know about how climate will change in the 21st century and beyond. We need to understand the issue better and fortunately, we have time. It is highly unlikely that the temperature in the middle of the next century will be significantly affected whether policies are enacted now or 20 years from now.” Does any of that statement strike you as crackpot or extreme or parti-pris? Rather, I’d suggest, it accords much more closely with what we now know about climate change than anything Exxon’s scientists were saying in the early 80s. Indeed, if Exxon had chosen to act on some of the more extreme scenarios painted by the in-house experts, they would not only now be looking very silly but they’d also be out of business. Exxon, let it be stressed, were quite right to be cautious on catastrophic man-made global warming theory. This was never a cover up. This was a company responding sensibly and proportionately to the evidence available at the time – and taking a stance which has subsequently been vindicated by observed reality.

        "articles": "Rather than denouncing acts of terrorism, just one day after recent tragic events in San Bernardino, Attorney General Loretta Lynch told a group assembled for the Muslim Advocates dinner that the Justice Department is prepared to take “aggressive action” against people employing anti-Muslim rhetoric that “edges towards violence.” In effect, she’s saying she would use prosecution as a weapon to protect Muslims from others employing their First Amendment rights. Seemingly, her greatest fear at the time was not another Paris, or San Bernardino, but “anti-Muslim rhetoric,” instead. Speaking at Muslim Advocate’s 10th anniversary dinner, Lynch said since the terrorist attacks in Paris last month, she is increasingly concerned with the “incredibly disturbing rise of anti-Muslim rhetoric … that fear is my greatest fear.” The fear that you have just mentioned is in fact my greatest fear as a prosecutor, as someone who is sworn to the protection of all of the American people, which is that the rhetoric will be accompanied by acts of violence. My message to not just the Muslim community but to the entire American community is: we cannot give in to the fear that these backlashes are really based on. Lynch made it clear that she shares those concerns, but vowed to use the DOJ to protect Muslims from discrimination and violence. Noting the rise in violence against Muslims and mosques in the wake of the Paris attacks, Lynch added that, “When we talk about the First amendment we [must] make it clear that actions predicated on violent talk are not American. They are not who we are, they are not what we do, and they will be prosecuted.” As for San Bernardino, yesterday at a press conference, Lynch said it presented a “wonderful opportunity” for change. UPDATE: Loretta Lynch, at a press conference yesterday, termed the San Bernardino shootings a “wonderful opportunity” to change the nature of police work: “We’re at the point where these issues have come together really like never before in law enforcement thought and in our nation’s history and it gives us a wonderful opportunity and a wonderful moment to really make significant change.” Israel / Middle EastPoliticsParis attacksSan Bernardino .

        "articles": "President Joe Biden unleashed a flurry of 94 executive actions on immigration in his first 100 days, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute. The president and his administration moved quickly to dismantle immigration enforcement measures put into place by former President Donald Trump, opening up the border to more illegal aliens and noncitizens. Unattended migrants continue to rush the border after Biden ended Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy and other measures to reduce the flow of noncitizens crossing the border. Under Biden, the Department of Homeland Security ordered Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to stop targeting illegal aliens for removal unless they pose gang involvement or significant criminal charges. ICE cases are also subject to review, slowing, or reversing enforcement actions. Criminal illegal aliens are also getting released from prison as a result of Biden’s new “sanctuary country” orders. As a result, MPI reports, ICE arrests have decreased by more than 60 percent under Biden from the last full months of detention during the Trump administration in February 2020, before the pandemic. The president also extended Temporary Protected Status for 320,000 Venezuelans and 1,600 Burmese, ended Trump’s public charge rule requiring immigrants to be financially independent, and terminated Trump’s travel and visa restrictions. Biden even scrapped a new more difficult citizenship civics test that former President Trump enacted for immigrants. The remarkable speed of Biden’s executive actions has dramatically exceeded the first 100 days of the Trump administration, as the former president enacted fewer than 30 executive actions on immigration.

        "articles": "President Donald Trump promised supporters Tuesday he was keeping an eye on Google, despite CEO Sundar Pichai’s reassurances they were not trying to stop him winning re-election in 2020. Trump cited an interview about the issue between Fox Business host Lou Hobbs and best-selling author and  Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer. “Peter Schweizer stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on Hillary Clinton, and boosted negative stories on Donald Trump,” Trump wrote. “All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!” The president referred to a meeting he had with Pichai, who defended his company against accusations of bias and censorship. “Sundar Pichai of Google was in the Oval Office working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China’s military, that they didn’t help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election, and that they are NOT planning to illegally subvert the 2020 Election despite all that has been said to the contrary,” Trump wrote on Twitter. The president said recent interviews with former Google engineer Kevin Cernekee made him think again about the accusations against Google of censorship and suppressing search results. “They have openly stated that they think 2016 was a mistake,” Cernekee said in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson. “They thought Trump should have lost in 2016. They really want Trump to lose in 2020. That’s their agenda.” ….are NOT planning to illegally subvert the 2020 Election despite all that has been said to the contrary.

        "articles": "Human rights activists were generally downbeat about the global state of affairs in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, often pointing to 2020 as one of the worst years in memory for declining civil liberties. Here are seven ways governments have used the Chinese coronavirus pandemic to diminish human rights and civil liberties. Freedom of Speech: The United Nations was among many agencies and advocacy groups to worry about the damage inflicted on freedom of speech during the pandemic, which included both rampant disinformation and ham-handed restrictions on speech in the name of controlling “disinformation.” “People have died because governments have lied, hidden information, detained reporters, failed to level with people about the nature of the threat, and criminalized individuals under the guise of ‘spreading false information. People have suffered because some governments would rather protect themselves from criticism than allow people to share information, learn about the outbreak, know what officials are or are not doing to protect them,” U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression David Kaye said in July. “In the past three months, numerous governments have used the COVID [Chinese coronavirus] -pandemic to repress expression in violation of their obligations under human rights law,” Kaye continued, citing Belarus, Cambodia, China, Iran, Egypt, India, Myanmar, and Turkey as nations of particular concern. “I am further concerned about efforts to repress disinformation using tools of criminal law, which are likely to hamper the free flow of information, such as in Brazil and Malaysia,” Kaye added. The International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX), an international education and development nonprofit, published a report in September called Freedom of Expression During Covid-19 that took a detailed look at how 20 different governments used the pandemic to curtail freedom of speech. Many of these restrictions were justified as efforts to control disinformation. Governments often cited the pandemic as an excuse to dramatically tighten existing restrictions on speech. Few examples of effective resistance to the new “emergency” restrictions were cited. Press freedom: Related to the free speech issue, but distinct enough to consider the subject on its own, is the damage inflicted upon journalism by the pandemic. In a year-end report published last week, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) found more reporters imprisoned around the world than ever before, many arrested for coverage of the pandemic that contradicted official narratives. Unsurprisingly, Communist China was especially brutal about arresting reporters for pandemic coverage that challenged the government. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) published a similar report, finding over 130 members of the press jailed for reporting on the pandemic, including citizen journalists. “Behind every single one of these cases is the fate of a person who faces criminal trials, long imprisonment and often mistreatment because he did not submit to censorship and repression,” said RSF’s director in Germany, Katja Gloger. Religious freedom: Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito warned in November that the pandemic imposed “previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty, from freedom of speech down to the right to a speedy trial, since almost every activity involving human contact has been restricted.” “The COVID crisis has served as a sort of constitutional stress test, and in doing so, it has highlighted disturbing trends that were already present before the virus struck,” Alito said. Justice Alito highlighted the danger to religious liberty, as houses of worship have been forced to obey extremely tight social distancing restrictions – often much tighter than activities involving more people and much greater risk of coronavirus transmission. He pointed to Nevada orders imposing much lower attendance caps on churches than casinos as an example. “Take a quick look at the Constitution. You will see the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, which protects religious liberty. You will not find a craps clause or a blackjack clause or a slot machine clause,” he said. Alito suggested – and some other religious freedom activists have explicitly asserted – that statist ideologues are using the coronavirus as an excuse to stamp out the freedom to congregate and worship, while giving free pandemic passes to activities they favor for ideological reasons, like mass protests. This hypocrisy and hostility to religion became especially obvious in New York, where the Supreme Court sided with religious groups against Governor Andrew Cuomo in November. Freedom of movement: Quarantines, travel bans, lockdowns, and similar restrictions are obviously difficult to square with the freedom of citizens to travel as they desire, which in turn compromises other human rights that involve the movement of people and goods. Human Rights Watch (HRW) listed this conflict near the top of its dissertation on human rights during the coronavirus crisis: Restrictions such as mandatory quarantine or isolation of symptomatic people must, at a minimum, be carried out in accordance with the law. They must be strictly necessary to achieve a legitimate objective, based on scientific evidence, proportionate to achieve that objective, neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, respectful of human dignity, and subject to review. Broad quarantines and lockdowns of indeterminate length rarely meet these criteria and are often imposed precipitously, without ensuring the protection of those under quarantine – especially at-risk populations. Because such quarantines and lockdowns are difficult to impose and enforce uniformly, they are often arbitrary or discriminatory in application. HRW noted that China’s quarantines were exceptionally brutal, listing cases of people killed by them, including children. In the darkest days of the outbreak in China, the government was locking infected people in their homes and welding bars over the doors and windows. Somewhat less horrifying, but still disturbing, was the recent emergency lockdown in South Australia that forbade imprisoned citizens from getting fresh air and exercise outside, or even walking their dogs. Surveillance vs. privacy rights: The coronavirus heightened concerns about intensive government surveillance, everywhere from dystopian China to the free world. There are good reasons to fear more governments will adopt China’s tools for monitoring citizens in the name of disease prevention, including versions of the mandatory smartphone app Beijing uses to color-code citizens for their infection status. Less draconian systems than China’s have been criticized for endangering privacy rights, such as the coronavirus alert program in South Korea, which had a habit of blasting out ostensibly “anonymous” alerts about infection that could easily be used to identify the individuals in question. Big Data solutions to the pandemic tend to create massive databases of sensitive information that could be employed by governments for other purposes, or compromised by hackers. Legal protections for privacy in the digital era are still evolving, and those protections can be all too easily shredded in a time of pandemic crisis, or perhaps other “crises” the political class decides are the moral or practical equivalent of the coronavirus pandemic. Political freedom: For better or worse, justified or otherwise, the pandemic led to a sizable number of delayed or canceled elections around the world. Opposition candidates frequently accused the governments in power of using the pandemic as an excuse to stave off elections that might have knocked them out of office. On the other hand, Iran’s stubborn insistence on holding an election for political theater was cited as one of the driving forces in that country’s horrific coronavirus outbreak. The effects of pandemic emergency measures on the 2020 U.S. presidential election will be debated for years to come. “Since the coronavirus outbreak began, the condition of democracy and human rights has worsened in 80 countries, with particularly sharp deterioration in struggling democracies and highly repressive states, according to the experts surveyed by the project. More than 60 percent of the respondents predicted that the pandemic’s impact on political rights and civil liberties in their countries of focus would be mostly negative for the next three to five years,” Freedom House warned in October. “What began as a worldwide health crisis has become part of the global crisis for democracy. Governments in every part of the world have abused their powers in the name of public health, seizing the opportunity to undermine democracy and human rights,” charged Freedom House President Michael J. Abramowitz. The pandemic was generally useful for political repression and nourished authoritarianism around the globe, including the democracies of the Western world. Arguably all of the other ways in which rulers and elites used the coronavirus to crush human rights contribute to the erosion of political freedom – restricting free speech and association inevitably weaken democracy, for example. Expanding government power: In America and around the world, opportunistic politicians and ideologues are using the pandemic to permanently increase their power and wealth. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) believes the virus it unleashed upon mankind will usher in the final triumph of centralized authoritarian power over free-market democracy because it supposedly proved that only authoritarian regimes can deal with a massive crisis like the Chinese coronavirus. Coronavirus lockdowns created power structures that can be used to enforce the will of the State in countless other areas. Skepticism that any of those “emergency” dictatorial powers will be relinquished after the Wuhan coronavirus recedes is warranted. Modern history suggests it is more likely those mechanisms of control will be repurposed, finding new missions after the pandemic is over – if, indeed, the political class is ever willing to declare it “over.” Once people have grown accustomed to life-changing emergency measures, their rulers will be reluctant to let that highly useful state of emergency end, at least not until an equally useful emergency comes along. The very nature of human rights and civil liberties could be redefined by the pandemic and its aftermath. At the very least, it is likely that governments across the free world will use the pandemic to argue that they should consume and control more of the private sector’s wealth, so they have enough resources to deal with a menace on the scale of the Chinese coronavirus. The “right” to be protected from pandemics – and other crises deemed comparably important by politicians and media – will be said to trump every other right, and unlike the other rights it displaces, it will require ever greater concentrations of power in national capitals to administer.

        "articles": "Political strategist Pat Caddell tells  News Daily on SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon about what he describes as the “stunning” emergency of “economic nationalism” that’s the driving force behind both the Republican primary race, and the Bernie Sanders insurgency against Hillary Clinton. As Caddell puts it, the American people have concluded they’re getting “screwed” by trade deals, immigration policy, and other areas where their interests are not considered a priority by their own political and business leaders. He contended this backlash against the elites was the reason so many highly-touted candidates have flamed out of the GOP primary, which is on the verge of boiling down to a two-man race between the two leading anti-Establishment candidates, Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz. Caddell said the critique of free trade from Trump – and to a lesser extent, his final remaining competitors – was the kind of break from party orthodoxy that could only happen during an election dominated by “outsider forces” and “insurgents.” “Trump is the more populist outsider, the insurgent,” said Caddell. “Ted Cruz has been the more ideological insurgent.” He attributed Trump’s greater success thus far to the primary electorate leaning toward populism, but saluted Cruz for “drawing his differences quite well” with Trump during Thursday’s encounter – a vitally important task for Cruz, as the once-crowded GOP primary moves into a two-candidate head-to-head finale. However, he chalked up the win for Trump based on the trade issue, which Caddell described as a “stunner” when he recently polled voters on the issues important to them. He said that poll showed “Republicans, and independents following Republicans, even more than Democrats are anti-free-trade… or, I should say, they have had it with trade deals, just as they’ve had it with the Washington establishment.” “What’s happening is, the economic anxiety – the tremendous alienation that exists, and the concerns about national security, and particularly China – are all fueling this nexus issue, which is all being expressed in concrete terms over these trade deals,” he explained, noting the issue scored especially strong in Michigan and Mississippi exit polls. Caddell further argued this “nexus issue” was the reason so many analysts were taken by surprise when Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in the Michigan Democrat primary. He faulted the hasty and superficial nature of many other media polls for failing to detect these powerful shifts of opinion in voters on both sides of the party divide. “It’s everywhere, in every constituency,” Caddell said of voter alienation from the Beltway establishment. “But remember, just this last August, Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, when Barack Obama was on his rear – having had the rug pulled out from under him by Democrats, and on the verge of a major defeat, in advance of the Iran deal – who came riding to his rescue but McConnell and Boehner – as I assume after they got the phone call from the Chamber of Commerce – and managed to finagle whatever way they did it, to resurrect TPA, the authority… and to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, if you’re looking at it politically.” Caddell said the “overwhelming sentiment” among Republican and Democrat voters alike is running against backroom deals, especially the kind voters fear will be coming their way as Republicans cave to Obama during his final lame-duck year. He cited one particular question from his poll, which found 72 percent agreement with the proposition that “the same people who have been rigging the rules in politics have been rigging the rules for their own benefit.” Caddell said Senator Marco Rubio and Governor John Kasich were “panicked” as they realized they’re on the wrong side of the trade issue from this huge contingent of alienated Republican voters. “You had Rubio, who said his foreign policy had three legs to the stool, and the third one was TPP. You had Kasich, who has been a big supporter of free trade… and I believe, I haven’t gone back and looked, but I think he was in Congress in ’93, and if so, I bet you he voted for NAFTA. How much you wanna bet? Somebody ought to look that one up. That’s the real point this morning, that could change the election in Ohio,” Caddell asserted. “If he did, as I suspect, voted for NAFTA, he could get killed on this now.” As a matter of fact, yes, John Kasich was a supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement. It has come up during the primary campaign in the past, most notably during a July interview between Kasich and Chuck Todd of NBC News, when Kasich weakly admitted, “I think we have, in some ways, been saps.” Caddell may take some satisfaction from knowing that Kasich has been trying a little damage control on free trade since the summer, but if he’s right about the Ohio endgame, it won’t be good enough to save Kasich from the forces of economic nationalism. Caddell said Ted Cruz has been on “both sides” of the recent trade authority dispute, a position Cruz clarified during the Thursday night debate by saying he was in favor of the authority process, but against the trade agreement that emerged. Caddell thought Trump has done a far better job of tacking into the wind of the Republican base voters’ disenchantment with trade agreements, saying he “struck there” first, at a time when the issue was still largely regarded as “ancillary” by Republican strategists. He argued that the press has fundamentally misunderstood the Trump phenomenon all along, because they think Trump’s personality and celebrity shifted GOP voters’ positions on issues like free trade and immigration, when in truth Trump was tapping into a “free-floating anxiety” about economics, and sense of “political alienation,” which had been building in those voters for years. “The ‘independent variable’ is the American people who are driving the election, and Donald Trump is the dependent variable,” Caddell declared. “He has been the vehicle closest, for many, many Republicans – despite all of the other problems – substantively, on the issue, and it is economic nationalism.” He advised other Republican candidates not to shy away from this “economic nationalism” concept, as fully 75 percent of their voters are behind it, and it’s also a major component of Bernie Sanders’ success on the Democrat side. “Wall Street will freak out. All of the quote ‘better people’ who’ve been sitting in their ivory towers, economists, saying, ‘oh, free trade is good for you,’ whatever… well, the American people have figured out that they’ve been screwed,” Caddell said, noting high levels of support for supposedly unthinkable measures like tariffs, especially when applied to countries that abuse trade agreements, or treat their workers poorly. “I am telling you, we’re in a new paradigm. This is a revolutionary moment,” he said, describing it as a “historical moment of evolution in our political process” whose outcome could not yet be predicted… especially by politicians and poll-addicted pundits who have misunderstood the Trump-Sanders moment thus far. Many of those pundits assumed Trump’s appeal would fizzle, comparing it to themes from earlier failed campaigns, as far back as Pat Buchanan’s run in 1992. If Caddell’s analysis is correct, what these other analysts missed was that many streams of discontent flowed into the river of “economic nationalism,” creating a unified focus for a huge number of Republican voters – and an impressive number of Democrats – who feel the incestuous political and Big Business elite no longer serve their interests. Indeed, a good deal of Washington culture is actively hostile toward them. These voters feel like internationalist orthodoxy was given a chance to succeed… and they are profoundly disappointed in the results. They haven’t just lost confidence in the elite. They don’t even think they can command its respect, or even get its attention. In Donald Trump, they see a champion who will not easily be ignored.

        "articles": "Over the course of about 5 years between 2004 – 2009, Hollywood produced no fewer than 18 anti-War On Terror box office bombs that defamed our country, our troops, and the righteous cause of the war against Islamic extremism. Every single one of those films bombed. The flop rate was 100%. Even Leftists stayed away in droves. Let me pass along some settled science… The domestic box office gross for all 18 of those films was around $300 million — or a pathetic $16 million each. My guess is that Hollywood lost somewhere around a billion — with “B” — dollars producing those box office bombs, that were designed specifically to undermine our warriors and to encourage the savage terrorists determined to kill them (and innocent Arabs and Muslims). “American Sniper,” a single patriotic pro-troop film that portrays the war against those same terrorist barbarians as righteous, will out-gross all 18 of those anti-War On Terror films combined. That’s science. That’s math. That’s a fact. In just 10 days of wide release, director Clint Eastwood’s masterpiece has already grossed $200 million. Box Office Mojo now predicts “Sniper” will easily pass the $350 million mark and could possibly gross $400 million. Here is some more math: “Sniper” cost just $60 million to produce. Those 18 pieces of pro-terrorist propaganda easily cost more than a billion dollars to produce. Just think of how much more money Hollywood and its stockholders would have today if that provincial, bigoted left-wing town wasn’t packed with people who hate America. Or if those same morally illiterate simpletons believed in math and profit. So far, on top of “American Sniper,” there have been 3 other films that depict the War On Terror as a righteous cause: “Lone Survivor,” “Act of Valor,” and “Zero Dark Thirty.” Together, those 3 films out-grossed all 18 anti-War On Terror films. NOTE: Almost all American war films are anti-war films, including “American Sniper” and every WWII film starring John Wayne. The question isn’t whether or not a film is anti-war (who isn’t anti-war?), the question is whether the film judges the cause as worth the hell or not. That’s the difference between “American Sniper” and the 18. And it is all the difference. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC EntertainmentAmerican Sniperbox officeChris KyleClint Eastwood .

        "articles": "The current 2020 Democrat frontrunner made the comments to Washingtonian magazine while being interviewed for a profile published in June 1974. Biden, then only 31-years-old, came to regret the interview, as his penchant for gaffes and insensitive remarks—traits defining later portions of his career—heavily colored the piece. At the time, however, Biden appeared eager to discuss his life as the nation’s youngest senator. “I am proud to be a politician,” Biden told then-Washingtonian writer Kitty Kelley, who authored the profile. “There is no other walk of life which can do more good for mankind than politics. It influences everything that happens to the American people.” Biden proceeded, according to Kelley, to lean “over his desk to shake his finger at me” while explaining elected officials like himself had the power to “take away” constitutionally protected rights if they saw fit. “And, whether you like it or not, young lady,” he said. “Us cruddy politicians can take away that First Amendment of yours if we want to.” Biden’s remarks to Washingtonian mirror those he made in an address to the City Club of Cleveland, Ohio in May 1973. Although that speech initially drew notice for comments Biden made likely to be offensive to women and his use of racially insensitive language —notably when he lectured about what “was good for the Negro,”– it also provided insight into his views on power and politics. “We spend a lot of time talking about the United States being a melting pot, well that’s true, but quite frankly I think it’s overrated,” Biden told the City Club. “We’ve been able to move forward because of politics. In my opinion, politics need not necessarily be a dirty word.” Biden expressed that despite the conventional feeling politics was “dirty,” politicians like him do more good for society than doctors or lawyers or “Indian chiefs.” “Politics should be the most honorable of professions,” he said. “Those of you who are doctors and lawyers and Indian chiefs in the audience, how can any of you possibly do as much good, if you are very good at what you do, as I can do if I am very good at what I can do?” ‘You can’t,” Biden added. “So the point is, this is where the action is.” At other points in the speech, Biden declared that politicians were just “as moral,” if not more so, than doctors. He also admitted to taking “great offense” at what he saw as the public’s “perilous” attempt to label anyone in elective office a “thief” or a “crook.” “I for one also take great offense, at 30-years-old achieving a life’s ambition, to seek the highest elective office, with one exception, in the land and the prestige of that office,” Biden said. “To now be put in the perilous position of being labeled as a ‘thief’ or a ‘crook’ as the rest of those politicians.” He made similar admissions about “enjoying the prestige of being a senator” to Washingtonian. Those statements, however, did not cause as much of a stir when published as Biden’s unbridled willingness to divulge details of his personal life. As Biden was a recent widower, having lost both his first wife, Neilia Biden, and 13-month-old daughter in a deadly car accident shortly after his election to the Senate in December 1972, a good deal of the interview was a reminiscence of his life before the tragedy. “Neilia was my very best friend, my greatest ally, my sensuous lover,” Biden told Kelley. “The longer we lived together the more we enjoyed everything from sex to sports. Most guys don’t really know what I lost because they never knew what I had.” “Let me show you my favorite picture of her,” Biden said as he held up a photo of his late wife in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Although opposed to his Senate campaign, Biden said his first wife got involved because he “would come back too tired to talk to her.” “At first she stayed at home with the kids while I campaigned, but that didn’t work out because I’d come back too tired to talk to her,” Biden said. “I might satisfy her in bed but I didn’t have much time for anything else.” “That’s when she started campaigning with me and that’s when I started winning,” he added. Despite bragging to Kelley about his sex-life, Biden told the female journalist he was “really quite conservative” on some political issues. “My wife said I was the most socially conservative man she had ever known… when it comes to issues like abortion… I’m about as liberal as your grandmother,” Biden said. “I don’t like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don’t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body.” When the profile was re-published online in 2015, Biden’s team made a concerted effort to dispute the accuracy of his position regarding Roe vs. Wade. This was only the most recent case in a 40-year-long attempt to discredit the profile. In the past, Biden’s staff has claimed portions of the interview were taken out of context and that Kelley did not respect requests that certain portions be “off-the-record.” Kelley, who went on to write several bestselling investigative biographies, has stood by the accuracy of her piece, saying “nothing was out of context.” Biden’s remarks, especially about the ability of “cruddy politicians” to “take away” the First Amendment, come to light as the candidate is attempting to paint the 2020 campaign as a battle for the “soul of America.” “Folks, look, the fact of the matter is that our core values, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America America is literally at stake—and that’s not hyperbole,” Biden said shortly after announcing his candidacy.

        "articles": "A California Republican lawmaker has introduced a referendum that would deport violent felons who are in the state illegally. According to the Los Angeles Times, the bill by state Sen. Tom Berryhill (R-Modesto) would put the issue before the voters on the ballot in 2018. If approved, the mandate would become part of the California Constitution. “We’re concerned about the public’s safety in California,” Berryhill told the Times. Berryhill’s proposal would only apply to those convicted felons who had committed one of the list of 23 violent offenses, which includes those below (courtesy of the Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation): (1) Murder or voluntary manslaughter. (2) Mayhem. (3) Rape as defined in paragraph (2) or (6) of subdivision (a) of Section 261 or paragraph (1) or (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 262. (4) Sodomy as defined in subdivision (c) or (d) of Section 286. (5) Oral copulation as defined in subdivision (c) or (d) of Section 288a. (6) Lewd or lascivious act as defined in subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 288. (7) Any felony punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison for life. (8) Any felony in which the defendant inflicts great bodily injury on any person other than an accomplice which has been charged and proved as provided for in Section 12022.7, 12022.8, or 12022.9 on or after July 1, 1977, or as specified prior to July 1, 1977, in Sections 213, 264, and 461, or any felony in which the defendant uses a firearm which use has been charged and proved as provided in subdivision (a) of Section 12022.3, or Section 12022.5 or 12022.55. (9) Any robbery. (10) Arson, in violation of subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 451. (11) Sexual penetration as defined in subdivision (a) or (j) of Section 289. (12) Attempted murder. (13) A violation of Section 12308, 12309, or 12310. (14) Kidnapping. (15) Assault with the intent to commit a specified felony, in violation of Section 220. (16) Continuous sexual abuse of a child, in violation of Section 288.5. (17) Carjacking, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 215. (18) Rape, spousal rape, or sexual penetration, in concert, in violation of Section 264.1. (19) Extortion, as defined in Section 518, which would constitute a felony violation of Section 186.22 of the Penal Code. (20) Threats to victims or witnesses, as defined in Section 136.1, which would constitute a felony violation of Section 186.22 of the Penal Code. (21) Any burglary of the first degree, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 460, wherein it is charged and proved that another person, other than an accomplice, was present in the residence during the commission of the burglary. (22) Any violation of Section 12022.53. (23) A violation of subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 11418. The Legislature finds and declares that these specified crimes merit special consideration when imposing a sentence to display society’s condemnation for these extraordinary crimes of violence against the person. That raises the question: Doesn’t California already deport felons in the country illegally upon release? The short answer is: sometimes. After the passage of the Trust Act (AB-4 Ammiano) in 2013 — initially vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown because the 2012 version explicitly shielded a host of violent offenders from deportation — cooperation between law enforcement and federal immigration authorities has become highly politicized. As a result, that cooperation is inconsistent, according to a high level source in the LA County Sheriff’s department. Berryhill’s bill goes one step further and would bar any ex-felon illegal alien who returned to California from receiving taxpayer-subsidized public assistance. Berryhill assured the Times that this initiative is not politically motivated, and credits President Donald Trump with inspiring him to act. “With the Trump administration doing what they’re doing, the timing seems to be good,” he said. “It’s on the forefront of everybody’s mind.” This proposed measure is not likely to affect a large number of illegal aliens, and pales in comparison to Republican proposals of the past. Proposition 187, which passed overwhelmingly in 1994, would have denied all taxpayer-funded public assistance to anyone in the country illegally, period — even including K-12 education.

Rendell first hit on GOP front-runner Donald Trump, saying he is “for real,” although he did clarify that he did not think Trump would wind up getting the GOP nomination. “Donald Trump is for real,” Rendell said. “For the first time I believe there’s a legitimate path for Donald Trump to be the nominee.” The former Pennsylvania governor then added Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL.) is the ticket that he would “fear the most.” “In terms of who we fear the most, on the Democratic side, just speaking for myself, I would fear John Kasich and Marco Rubio as vice president. That would be the ticket I would fear the most,“ he continued. “I would also fear Rubio to an extent, but Rubio runs into trouble, because the Republicans have argued for eight years that Barack Obama wasn’t ready to be president, because he had only been a U.S. senator for a short time, less than three years, and he had no previous executive experience, and that sort of fits the bill for Marco Rubio as well.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent ClipsPoliticsCats RoundtableEd RendellJohn CatsimatidisJohn KasichMarco Rubio .

        "articles": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old, Bernie-Sanders-supporting political novice, has defeated incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in the 14th congressional district in the New York primary. With 88% of precincts reporting in the heavily-Democratic district that spans Queens and the Bronx, Ocasio-Cortez had crushed Crowley, 57.6% to 42.4%, a margin of nearly 3,600 votes. CNN notes that Ocasio-Cortez is a self-described “democratic socialist.” Crowley, currently in his 10th term and the chair of the House Democratic Caucus — ranked 4th in the whole caucus — was considered a possible future candidate for Speaker of the House, and had not faced a primary challenge in 14 years. He has now become the first major casualty of the so-called “Resistance” — the left-wing movement that emerged to oppose President Donald Trump but has also clashed with the Democratic Party establishment. Left: a campaign poster for Ocasio-Cortez. Right: Ocasio-Cortez celebrates with supporters at a victory party in the Bronx. (Scott Heins/Getty Images) Politico observes that Ocasio-Cortez “challenged Crowley on ideological and racial grounds.” She argued that the district needed a more left-wing representative, as well as someone who reflected the “majority-minority” demographic of the area, which has become increasingly Latino. (Or, as she prefers, “Latinx.”) It’s time we say it: New York politics has an enormous misogyny problem. It has far-reaching consequences. In NYC our Governor, Mayor, Council Speaker, and Queens Dem Boss are all powerful white men. That’s not an accident. It’s a culture. #MeToo  — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) May 8, 2018 Ocasio-Cortez ran on an explicit promise to abolish the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, as well as to nationalize health care.

She organized a large volunteer contingent to canvass her district while she was away. In order for me to go to the border 2 days before the primary, our whole movement nationwide had to come together & hold it down in New York City.

I hope my peers have the moral courage to call it such. No state or entity is absolved of mass shootings of protesters. There is no justification. Palestinian people deserve basic human dignity, as anyone else. Democrats can’t be silent about this anymore.  — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) May 14, 2018 She also attacked Crowley for his alleged support for the transfer of the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In a bizarre twist, Rep. Crowley sent a woman with slight resemblance to me as his official surrogate to last night’s debate.@repjoecrowley’s surrogate said he is in full support of Trump’s embassy change in Israel last month (where 60 people died). The community was in shock.  — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) June 19, 2018 Ocasio-Cortez enjoyed the support of left-wing celebrities like Susan Sarandon, who hails from the area. Her campaign ads were sharp, innovative, and eye-catching. And she drew on widespread grassroots frustration with the Democratic Party establishment. The left may have found a new standard-bearer — and Republicans may have found a new target. President Trump celebrated her win over one of his loudest critics: Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley, who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi’s place, just LOST his primary election. In other words, he’s out!

        "articles": "Muslim chaplains working within Britain’s prison system have been routinely distributing Islamist hate literature, leaving extremist pamphlets preaching death to non-believers and hatred of the West within easy reach of inmates, a leaked review has revealed. The Ministry of Justice, who has oversight for chaplaincy appointments within prisons, is understood to have issued an urgent internal alert warning of “severe reputation damage” thanks to the extremist nature of the material. The compact discs (CDs) and leaflets, some of which were imported from Saudi Arabia, contain homophobic and misogynistic messages, as well as inciting hatred against non-Muslims and Western culture. Yet it was left by the Muslim chaplains on library bookshelves where inmates were free to come and peruse it, The Times has reported. Lack of scrutiny inside the jails paired with weak corporate guidance meant that there was very little or even no assessment of the material before it was released to “impressionable minds”, the leaked report said. And it found that the chaplains at several jails had been encouraging inmates to raise funds for Islamic charities with links to extremist organisations and international terrorism, warning that failings at senior levels within the prison service had created a breeding ground for Islamic radicalisation. Others of Britain’s approximately 100 Muslim chaplains were unaware of their statutory duty to prevent inmates being drawn into extremism, or were under-equipped to take on counter-radicalisation work “sometimes because they lacked the capability but often because they didn’t have the will”. The report comes just days after some high security prisons were found to have ‘Sharia blocks,’ where former terrorists and Islamic extremists were taking over and imposing Sharia law on non-Muslim inmates. Overall, it is said to have “pulled no punches”, taking to task the National Offender Management Service (Noms), the Ministry of Justice executive body that oversees prisons. “Nobody there has been brave enough to confront and tackle this pernicious ideology,” a Whitehall insider said. The review, led by a former senior Home Office official and ordered by Justice Secretary Michael Gove, has not yet been released as it is still awaiting clearance from No 10. A summarised version was due to be released last month but has been postponed. For the last 13 years the process for appointing Muslim chaplains has been overseen by Ahtsham Ali, the prison service’s Muslim adviser. He has previously held senior roles in British organisations with strong links to India’s Jamaat-e-Islami movement, founded by the Islamist theologist Abul Ala Maududi. Yet despite the report’s findings, Michael Spurr, Noms chief executive, has issued a letter insisting that Mr Ali retained the confidence and support of the organisation. Meanwhile concern is growing regarding the over-representation within the prison service of chaplains drawn from the Deobandi sect, another Islamic sect founded in India, and the influence they may have on the 12,328 Muslim inmates held in English and Welsh jails, particularly the 1,000 deemed vulnerable to radicalisation. The Deobandis are the largest sect in the UK, controlling 600 of the UK’s 1,500 mosques, the majority of Britain’s Muslim schools, and turning out 80 percent of all domestically trained scholars. 70 percent of Muslim prison chaplains were trained in Deobandi seminaries. But although it claims to be moderate, it has hosted the hate preachers who trained the 9/11 bombers, while its schools have been caught disseminating anti-Semitic and misogynistic literature. An offshoot, the slightly more hard-line Tablighi Jamaat, has been described by some as an “Army of Darkness”. London / EuropeBritish Muslimshate speechradical muslims .

        "articles": "BuzzFeed News pulled off a tricky feat Wednesday, managing to offend most of civil society and even its peers in progressive media with a hit piece on Christian reality television stars Chip and Joanna Gaines. The stars of HGTV’s home renovation show Fixer Upper, it was reported by BuzzFeed, attend the Antioch Community Church in Waco, Texas, a church that has as one of its beliefs that marriage is between one man and one woman. “Chip and Joanna Gaines’ Church is Firmly Against Same-Sex Marriage,” the headline announced. Reporter Kate Aurthur wrote: So are the Gaineses against same-sex marriage? And would they ever feature a same-sex couple on the show, as have HGTV’s House Hunters and Property Brothers? Emails to Brock Murphy, the public relations director at their company, Magnolia, were not returned. Nor were emails and calls to HGTV’s PR department. When Aurthur could not get a response from the couple’s representatives, she took aim at their church and at its leader, pastor Jimmy Seibert, who she described as having a “severe, unmovable position” on the issue of same-sex marriage. “This is a clear biblical admonition,” Seibert said of the concept of traditional marriage in a sermon delivered in June 2015, on the day the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide. “So if someone were to say, ‘Marriage is defined in a different way,’ let me just say: They are wrong. God defined marriage, not you and I. God defined masculine and feminine, male and female, not you and I.” The insinuation made by the article is clear: that the Gaineses could themselves be against gay marriage because they attend a church that believes in traditional marriage. And Aurthur infers that the hosts might not “ever feature a same-sex couple [as a client] on the show.” The article was almost universally panned by readers, even on BuzzFeed’s own site. “This is the dumbest story I have ever heard,” wrote one reader in the most popular comment under the story. “It’s like a witch hunt for their beliefs, to try an stir the oil from a pot into the flames of the stove. This kind of article is exactly what is wrong with the media.” “This is a tired, forced witch hunt,” wrote another commenter. “You are inciting a wave of negative attention on this couple for something that indirectly links to them. That’s not journalism, it’s petty bullshit.” Gabriel Malor, a gay conservative attorney and pundit, called the article “purely harassment.” But the reporter never ascertained the couple's view before publishing the piece about them. That's purely harassment, not journalism. — Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) November 30, 2016 BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith attempted to defend the story on his Twitter account Wednesday evening: “This is a story about a big company, HGTV, refusing to say whether they ban LGBT people from a TV show. They should just answer the question.” But Smith’s media peers, from both left and right-leaning outlets, weren’t buying it. “It’s not quite framed that way though,” the Daily Beast’s Olivia Nuzzi wrote in response. “[T]he framing is on the couple, not HGTV,” Business Insider‘s Paul Szoldra challenged Smith. “So are the Gaineses against same-sex marriage?” that’s 1st q, not network.” Others noted that HGTV has featured many gay couples on its programs in the past, and still others responded more sarcastically: “I always address what the story is all about in two sentences in the fourth paragraph too,” wrote Popehat. Several Twitter users pointed out that Aurthur, days before her piece ran, implied that the idea of the clients on Fixer Upper voting for Donald Trump “ruined” the show. And Fixer Upper. — Kate Aurthur (@KateAurthur) November 27, 2016 The site’s pressure on Fixer Upper recalls recent legal battles where gay couples sued Christian-owned businesses for refusing to provide their services for same-sex weddings. Several businesses that have been targetted legally and financially include Elane Photography in New Mexico, Sweet Cakes by Melissa in Oregon, and Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado. Representatives for HGTV did not immediately respond to a request for comment from  News. BuzzFeed describes itself as “the leading independent digital media company” that delivers “news and entertainment worth sharing with [our readers’] friends, family, and the people who matter in their lives.” For many years, critics pigeonholed the site as a platform for cat gifs, but it has recently broken that mold and become the go-to platform for corporate advertorials and the Social Justice movement’s raging id.

        "articles": "Prostitutes from Dennis Hof’s Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Mound, Nevada have officially endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. With a new campaign called “Hookers for Hillary,” Hof says his girls will do anything they can to support Hillary. “I’m reaching out to the Democrats in northern Nevada and saying ‘what can we do to help?'” Hof told The Daily Caller. “Air Force Amy has announced that she’s going to give another half-hour to any donor who donates to Hillary. An extra half-hour of time in the bedroom. That’s her way of supporting. All the girls are coming up with different things they can do.” “Hookers vote too,” he added. Hillary’s stance on foreign policy is apparently one reason the “Bunnies” have endorsed her, video below, citing her ability to negotiate with foreign leaders similar to how they communicate with foreign men through a “language barrier.” Another reason the prostitutes want Hillary in the White House is because of health insurance, which they have never had access to, according to Hof. “They classify them in the same category as illegal prostitutes, who have sexually transmitted diseases. Legal prostitutes don’t. So the girls are thrilled with Obamacare, that they finally have proper healthcare,” he explained. Another prostitute has reportedly pledged to donate the money she receives from selling her underwear online to the Hillary campaign. TMZ obtained videos of two women from the farm, wherein they explain why they are proudly backing Hillary Clinton. “Because I’ll stick by any woman that stands by her man in a cheating relationship so that she can further her career,” says Air Force Amy. “I’m voting for Hillary Clinton because I have just as much trouble with my emails as she does.” Ava Adora cites healthcare reform as a basic human right and thinks Hillary will continue to fight for it as leader of the free world. “I think it’s kind of sad that as one of the best countries in the world we don’t have that as a universal system,” she says.

        "articles": "The Prime Minister has said the “Islamist” attack on Parliament was not “Islamic” and Islam is a “great faith”. Taking on the role of a theologian, Theresa May insisted: “It is wrong to describe this as Islamic terrorism. It is Islamist terrorism. It is a perversion of a great faith.” Speaking in Parliament, she also said the attack showed “the importance of all of our faiths working together, and recognising the values that we share”. Adding: “This act of terror was not an act of faith. It was a perversion; a warped ideology, which leads to an act of terrorism like that and it will not prevail.” Islamism is generally defined as a political interpretation of Islam. Some critics argue Islam is intrinsically political – as the Quran mandates a religious state and law – and say the term is irrelevant. MPs almost unanimously agreed with the Prime Minister, lining up to warn against “demonising” and “stigmatising” Muslims, and to condemn “Islamophobia” and “racial and religious” discrimination. Khalid Mahmood, the Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said the attacker or attackers “pretend to be of a particular religion”. “If they were of a religion they would not be carrying out acts like this,” he added. Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, added: “People who commit acts of terrorism in the name of Islam do not speak for the majority of Muslims in this country.” UKIP leader Paul Nuttall, meanwhile, did not shy away from describing the attack as “Islamic”. “We have a cancer within a particular community and it needs to be cut out,” he told Sky News outside Westminster Palace. “The Muslim community I believe needs to do more about this. “We have the problem that we have 800 British citizens out fighting in Syria and Iraq for Islamic State. “I don’t believe they should be allowed to return and I think that, down the line, we’re going to have to look at foreign funding of mosques, particularly from Saudi Arabia, who promote radicalism across the globe.” FaithLondon / EuropeIslamismLondonradical islamTheresa MayWestminsterWestminster Attack .

        "articles": "On October 3–two days after a gunman killed 10 at the gun free facilities on the Umpqua Community College campus–the New York Daily News called for the U.S. State Department to designate the National Rifle Association (NRA) a “terrorist organization.” They based this request on their belief that national security faces a greater threat from armed citizens than from “foreign terrorists,” and they singled out the NRA as the bulwark preserving citizens’ right to keep and bear arms. They suggested, “The NRA should take its rightful place on the State Department list of terrorist organizations, because its influence is more of an immediate threat to the lives of our citizens than foreign terrorists.” To be on the State Department’s list of designated terror organizations a group has to be state-sponsored for terrorism–which the NRA is not. Moreover, they do not exist for terrorist reasons. Rather, they exist to defend the civil liberties protected by the Second Amendment. Undaunted by these things, the NYDN simply declares the NRA a “terrorist group” and suggests it falls under the State Department’s purview by being “nearly-state sponsored.” The NYDN added, “Although the NRA is not an officially state-sponsored organization it is the supporter of the state with its massive member and lobbyist donations to our elected officials.” They remind readers that “murdered Americans killed by…lunatic gun slingers include terrified children calling for their mothers, teachers begging for the lives of their students, students begging for not just their own lives but the lives of their classmates, moviegoers looking for escape, bystanders cheering for athletes, athletes trying to be the best they can be as the worst we ever could have imagined struck them down in cold blood.” No mention is made that the children, teachers, and students shot in schools were shot in gun free zones by gunmen who knew their victims could not return fire. Moreover, no utterance given to the fact that the NRA was a leading voice in calling for a change in the gun free policies following the heinous attack on Sandy Hook–they wanted laws changed so teachers could quit begging for their lives and start keeping a gun close at hand with which to defend their lives and the lives of their students. On December 21, 2012–one week after the attack on Sandy Hook–the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre said; …Politicians pass laws for Gun-Free School Zones. They issue press releases bragging about them. They post signs advertising them. And in so doing, they tell every insane killer in America that schools are their safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk. How have our nation’s priorities gotten so far out of order? Think about it. We care more about our money, so we protect our banks with armed guards. American airports, office buildings, power plants, courthouses — even sports stadiums — are all protected by armed security. We care about the President, so we protect him with armed Secret Service agents. …Yet when it comes to the most beloved, innocent and vulnerable members of the American family — our children — we as a society leave them utterly helpless, and the monsters and predators of this world know it and exploit it. That must change now! The NRA’s position is that faculty and students with concealed carry permits should have the option of being armed on campus so they can fight back. It is that simple.

        "articles": "TEL AVIV – A dispatch contained in the 1,500 pages of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails released last weekend provide insight into the level of support the U.S. was considering in 2012 for Egypt’s newly elected Muslim Brotherhood government. On August 30, 2012, Robert D. Hormats, the under-secretary of state for economic affairs, wrote to Clinton’s then-Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan to update him on a meeting he held with Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Supreme Adviser Khairat al-Shater. Shater was later sentenced to life imprisonment and then to death for multiple alleged crimes, including inciting violence and financial improprieties. The email reveals Hormats and other U.S. diplomats discussed methods of cooperation with Shater, including an increase in American direct foreign investment. Hormats wrote: Anne Patterson, Bill Taylor, and I met with Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Supreme Guide Khairat al-Shater. He discussed broad principles of economic development based on 100 large infrastructure projects (over a billion dollars each) as part of Morsi’s Nadah (Renaissance Plan) Plan; ways of cooperating with the US to obtain support for these projects and for SMEs; and his hope for an IMF agreement and increased foreign direct investment from the US, the West, and the Arab world. He also noted that it was a priority for the GOE to build a true democratic system based on human rights and the rule of law. Patterson, the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt at the time, was known for her repeated engagement with the Muslim Brotherhood. Taylor was the U.S. Special Coordinator for Middle East Transitions; that is, the U.S. envoy to the new leadership that emerged in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring. Hormats’ meetings with the Muslim Brotherhood were not secret. But the emails reveal the scope of his discussions with the group about possible future investment. In September 2012, the New York Times reported that Hormats had led a delegation of businesses to Egypt to discuss possible private investment. That same month, the State Department published a document that received little news media attention. It revealed that in August and September 2012, “Hormats visited Egypt to negotiate possible bilateral debt relief,” but the document did not provide further details. After the toppling of Egypt’s longtime president Hosni Mubarak, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Muhammad Morsi served as president from June 30, 2012 to July 3, 2013, when he was removed from office amidst widespread protests and a military coup. After Mubarak was removed from office, the Obama administration pledged $1 billion in assistance to bolster Egypt’s transition to democracy. Clinton and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta each visited Cairo and met with Morsi during his tenure as president. The meeting that Hormats describes in the email took place while the U.S. was negotiating an aid package to help relieve Egypt’s debt crisis amid concerns from U.S. lawmakers about funding the Muslim Brotherhood. The email was sent a week and a half before protesters besieged the U.S. Embassy in Cairo on September 11, 2012, the same day the U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi came under attack. Following the attacks, Obama stated of Morsi’s government, “I don’t think that we would consider them an ally, but we don’t consider them an enemy.” With research by Brenda J. Elliott.

        "articles": "The White House responded Thursday to an attempt by Senate Democrats to smear Judge Brett Kavanaugh with unfounded allegations. “Senator Schumer promised to ‘oppose Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination with everything I have,’ and it appears he is delivering with this 11th-hour attempt to delay his confirmation,” White House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement to reporters. Sen. Dianne Feinstein issued a statement that she sent a letter from a person involved with Kavanaugh to the FBI, suggesting that she was concerned about the contents. The New York Times reports that officials “familiar with the matter” suggested that the letter had to do with “possible sexual misconduct” with Kavanaugh and a women when they were both in high school. Kavanaugh went to Georgetown Preparatory high school, which is an all-boys school. The White House reminded critics the FBI had vetted Kavanaugh throughout his 25-year career, he had sat through 65 meetings with senators, 30 hours of testimony, and addressed over 2,000 questions, throwing into question the timing of the new information. “Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new ‘information’ about him,” Kupec said. The New York Times reports that Feinstein received the letter earlier in the summer, but only shared the contents of it with Democrats on the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.

        "articles": "Former Vice President Mike Pence released a video statement Tuesday, from Advancing American Freedom, his new policy and advocacy organization, blaming President Joe Biden and his administration for the Israel and Gaza conflict due to his lack of strength. Pence started by reaffirming “Israel is America’s most cherished ally,” and he believes this wholeheartedly. During Pence’s time as the vice president under President Donald Trump, he was honored to visit Israel and meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu and see the western wall. Pence said under the Trump-Pence administration, the United States and Israel witnessed “four years of progress toward peace.” He said the “Trump-Pence administration‘s commitment to Israel was unrivaled,” and they “made that clear to the world through our actions.” He explained that Israel has been seeing unprovoked violence for more than a week from the terrorist group Hamas, asserting that this was able to happen from the weakness Biden shows while in office. Pence said, “Biden has replaced strength with weakness, moral clarity with confusion, and loyalty with betrayal.” During the Trump-Pence administration, Pence said, they “brokered historic peace deals in the Middle East, we withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, and it was three years ago last week that our administration kept a decades-old promise.” Pence expressed since Biden took office in January, all that has changed. With Biden being inaugurated, he continued to say, violence reignited and his “weakness arouses evil” instead of “seeking peace through strength.” Pence said “our friends in Israel are paying a terrible price.” Biden has even hurt Israel by “restoring funding to the Palestinian Authority,” and Biden further endangered Israel with his announcement to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. Pence explained the difference between Israel and Hamas, saying, “One is a sovereign nation with a legitimate government and a trusted ally, the other is an internationally recognized terrorist organization.” Since the start of this conflict, the terrorist group in Gaza has “now fired more than 3,000 rockets at Jewish families and businesses in the past week alone.” Pence said Biden, along with every other leader the United States, should uphold “Israel’s right to self-defense and condemn the terrorists of Hamas,” including condemning any type of supporters and apologists. Pence ended his statement by saying, in the “midst of these unprovoked attacks” on Israel, “let’s pray for the peace of Jerusalem and if the world knows nothing else, let the world know this, America stands with Israel.” Israel / Middle EastPoliticsDonald TrumpGaza StripIsraelJoe BidenMike Pence .

        "articles": "PARIS (AFP) – A known terror suspect shot dead a French policeman and wounded two others on Paris’s Champs Elysees in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group, days before a presidential election. Observers had long feared bloodshed ahead of Sunday’s vote in France following a string of atrocities since 2015 and the violence is likely to thrust security to the front of voters’ minds. Here is a recap of major assaults and foiled attempts since the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris in January 2015. – January 7-9: Two men armed with Kalashnikov rifles storm the Paris offices of satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo killing 12 people. A policewoman is killed just outside Paris the following day, while a gunman takes hostages at a Jewish supermarket, four of whom are killed. The attackers are killed in separate shootouts with police, but not before claiming allegiance to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS). BELGA PHOTO LAURIE DIEFFEMBACQ / AFP – February 3: A knife-wielding man attacks three soldiers guarding a Jewish community centre in Nice on the French Riviera. The 30-year-old assailant, Moussa Coulibaly, is arrested. In custody, he expresses his hatred for France, the police, the military and Jews. – April 19: Sid Ahmed Ghlam, an Algerian IT student, is arrested on suspicion of killing a woman who was found shot dead in her car, and of planning an attack on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Prosecutors say they found documents about Al-Qaeda and IS at his home, and that he had been in touch with a suspected jihadist in Syria about an attack on a church. – June 26: Frenchman Yassin Salhi, 35, kills and beheads his boss Herve Cornara and displays the severed head, surrounded by two Islamic flags, on the fence of a gas plant in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier in southeastern France. He tries to blow up the factory, but is arrested. He commits suicide in his jail cell in December. – July 13: Four men aged 16 to 23, including a former soldier, are arrested on charges of planning an attack on a military camp to behead an officer in the name of jihad. They proclaim allegiance to IS. – August 21: Passengers prevent a bloodbath on a high-speed Thalys train from Amsterdam to Paris, tackling a man who opened fire on travellers. He was armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, an automatic pistol and a box-cutter. The gunman is identified as 25-year-old Moroccan national Ayoub El Khazzani, known to intelligence services for links to radical Islam.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) – November 13: IS jihadists armed with assault rifles and explosives strike outside a France-Germany football match at the national stadium, Paris cafes, and the Bataclan concert hall in a coordinated assault that leaves 130 people dead and more than 350 wounded, the deadliest attack of its kind in French history. – January 7: A man wielding a meat cleaver and carrying an IS emblem is shot dead as he tries to attack a police station in Paris. Convicted of theft in 2013, the man identified himself at the time as Moroccan- born Sallah Ali. – June 13: Larossi Abballa, 25, kills police officer Jean-Baptiste Salvaing, 42, and his partner, Jessica Schneider, 36, at their home in Magnanville, west of Paris. Salvaing is stabbed to death, while Schneider’s throat is slit in front of their young son. Abballa is killed by a police SWAT team, but has already claimed the murders on social media in the name of the Islamic State group.

        "articles": "Treating this stupid media controversy like it deserves to be treated, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump took to Twitter to wrist-flick away the latest bubbled, leftwing mainstream media frenzy. Early Saturday morning The Donald tweeted, “Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don’t think so!” More common sense and humor soon followed: — This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2015 — If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2015 — If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man’s right of free speech. A no win situation! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2015 — Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2015 — After a questioner at an open forum Trump held Thursday attacked President Obama for being a Muslim, our utterly useless and out-of-touch media ginned up a non-troversy over the fact that Trump blew the guy off. According to our Obama-loving media, Trump was obligated to tell tell the guy off and vouch for the president’s patriotism and Christian faith. The media also believe that Trump is responsible for a supporter misled by Hillary Clinton. For it was Hillary Clinton who planted the first seeds of the Birther/Obama-Is-A-Muslim conspiracy back in 2008. This is a documented fact. Not only is our Islamophobic media acting like being misidentified as a Muslim is a slur, what everyone’s forgetting is that Obama might be a much better man were he in fact a Muslim. If nothing else, Obama would not have spent 20 years in Jeremiah Wright’s creepy, racist Christian church. To protect Obama, the media ignores the homeless, the unemployed, the under-employed, the EPA disaster in Colorado, the men who died and risked their lives for Obama’s precious “hero” Bowe Bergdahl … …And now the media’s Obama protection racket is so overblown they demand Republicans defend Obama from rumors started by Hillary Clinton.

        "articles": "Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina argued that Hillary Clinton “has lived in her own world and in her own bubble for so long that she really doesn’t perceive these very real conflicts of interest as conflicts of interest” and “I’ve been far more specific than Donald Trump about the need to secure the border” on Wednesday’s “Hannity” on the Fox News Channel. Fiorina first commented on Hillary Clinton’s CNN interview, stating, “Well, it’s back to the vast right-wing conspiracy, Sean. It’s all the fault of the vast right-wing conspiracy. And in that interview, which I think was really vintage Clinton. She did not answer a single question, really. She did not accept accountability for anything, really. I honestly think she has lived in her own world and in her own bubble for so long that she really doesn’t perceive these very real conflicts of interest as conflicts of interest. She just wants people to trust her.” Fiorina continued, “I think, as the polls indicate, people don’t trust her. And that means the foundation of leadership is not solid for her. But I also want you to notice something else, Sean, she was not asked a single question about her track record as secretary of state. She wasn’t asked about why she thought a gimmicky red reset button would stop Vladmir Putin. She wasn’t asked about why she called President Bashar al-Assad of Syria a positive reformer. She wasn’t asked why she declared victory in Iraq in 2011. She wasn’t asked if thought she had lied to the American people about Benghazi, and what she thinks now of the fact that Libya is a failed state and a haven for terrorists. In other words, she isn’t going to be asked the questions she needs to be asked. Which is why we must have a nominee who will face her on a general election debate stage and ask every single one of those questions, so that the American people have the facts they need to make a good judgment.” Fiorina added that Clinton “wants to run as the first woman president. If, for example, I faced her on a general election debate stage, she wouldn’t get to run as the first woman president, would she? She’d actually have to answer a question about her track record, about her accomplishments, about her trustworthiness. And I would point out, that not only has she taken money from governments with atrocious human rights records, but she as secretary of state took human rights and women’s rights off the table in her discussions with China specifically, even though she made a big show of showing up in China to talk about women’s rights or human rights, and yet when she was in a position to pursue that conversation with China as secretary of state, she took it off the table.” She then turned to Donald Trump’s remarks, Fiorina said, “Well, I think, first of all, that it’s inaccurate to say that the Mexican government is purposefully sending all of their criminal elements. I think, secondly, it’s obviously true that we have a lot of criminal elements, and I think we need to collaborate more with Mexico to be sure. I think Donald Trump has raised an important issue, but as Rudy Giuliani said in your previous segment, these issues have been around for a very long time. It has been a problem with an insecure border, sanctuary cities, crime, criminal elements coming in through an illegal immigration problem that hasn’t been fixed under Republicans or Democrats. And I think it points out the fact that we have too much hyperbole and too many sound bites in our political process, and not enough problem-solving, and not enough results. Everybody talks about it, Republicans and Democrats alike, particularly around election time, and yet somehow, the border remains insecure.” Fiorina concluded, “I think when we condemn a whole group of people wholesale, that doesn’t help us solve the problem. … I too, have offered a solution to the illegal immigration problem. I’ve been far more specific than Donald Trump about the need to secure the border, about how I would fix the legal immigration system. For an example, I’ve been very specific about how I would deal with those who have come here illegally and stayed here illegally. But when we paint whole groups of people as bad people, I don’t think that helps us advance the conversation. I think what we need now, honestly, in all of our political process, is less rhetoric, and more results. less talk and more problem solving.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett ClipsImmigrationPoliticsCarly FiorinaDonald TrumpHillary Clinton .

        "articles": "The faculty council at the University of Kansas is calling for the removal of Chick-fil-A from campus by arguing that the company is a “bastion of bigotry.” According to a local news report, a group of faculty members at the University of Kansas are upset about chicken sandwiches. More specifically, they are upset with the Chick-fil-A restaurant on their campus, which was recently moved to a more prominent location. Dan Cathy, the CEO of Chick-fil-A, was the subject of widespread criticism by leftists in 2012 when he came out against same-sex marriage legislation. “We’re inviting God’s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say we know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,” Cathy said in 2012. “And I pray God’s mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude that thinks we have the audacity to redefine what marriage is all about.” Now, a letter from the faculty council at the University of Kansas makes the case that Chick-Fil-A’s values are incompatible with those held by the university. They specifically state their concern that the new Chick-fil-A location is near the university’s first gender-neutral bathrooms. Despite our denouncements and the university’s own moves to increase the campus’s diversity, equity, and inclusion, KU granted Chick-fil-A, a bastion of bigotry, a prime retail location in the heart of our campus. The Union houses spaces that the KU community designates as safe and accepting—not least of which are the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Center for Sexual & Gender Diversity. When the Memorial Union was first built, it featured segregated dining facilities. Over the past few decades, however, the building has become a crucial part of student life, accommodating dozens of student organizations and offices—all functioning to create an environment of academic, cultural, political, and social engagement for all KU students, staff and faculty, as well as numerous visitors to our campus. The Union was one of the first places on campus to incorporate gender inclusive bathrooms for the comfort and validation of the experiences and range of identities of the people who walk our halls. The arrival of Chick-fil-A in this building is insulting, counterproductive, and unacceptable.  News reported in March that Cynthia Newman, the dean of the Rider College of Business, resigned from her position in protest of the university’s treatment of Chick-fil-A. Rider had previously announced that it would be banning Chick-Fil-A from campus due to the chain’s Christian values. Stay tuned to  News for more updates on this story.

        "articles": "During an appearance on FNC’s “Hannity” on Friday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) warned the incoming Biden administration is positioning itself to use national security tool against political opponents. Gaetz told host Sean Hannity that he and several of his House colleagues were being targeted for the positions they held on election intergrity. “[W]e should take note of the language that the left is using — chemical warfare, insurrection, domestic terrorism,” he said. “That’s not by accident, Sean. There are exquisite authorities in our national laws that allow our government to do things to terrorists that we would never allow against our own people. But in the incoming Biden administration, they want to use national security authorities against MAGA. They’re targeting Mo Brooks, Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs, Louie Gohmert, Madison Cawthorn and myself because we had the nerve to actually stand up and point out the need for election integrity.” “And we also pointed out their hypocrisy, because for all of the criticism that they have leveled against Donald Trump unfairly, they were the cheerleaders, fundraisers and apologists for the people who burned our cities, attacked our police and were on offense against the very notion of America for months this summer,” Gaetz continued. “They don’t want to account for that. Joe Biden doesn’t want to answer for it. Certainly, Kamala Harris doesn’t. And so, they are going to go after the president and his allies and they’re going to use national security authorities that you should never use against our fellow Americans.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor ClipsPoliticsBiden AdministrationFox News ChannelHannityMatt Gaetz .

        "articles": "On Friday, students occupying the administration building at Occidental College ejected  News’ Adelle Nazarian from their “safe space,” saying they felt “threatened” by her presence and referring to her as “an adult in a student-occupied space.” “We’re requesting that you respect the fact that this is a community-owned space by students,” one of the male students said. He said there was “an issue of safety” as a result of Nazarian’s “adult presence,” which supposedly posed a direct threat to the occupying students’ well-being. Nazarian recorded the incident. The audio is below (language warning). The episode recalls the classic quote by New Left activist Jack Weinberg, veteran of the UC Berkeley Free Speech Movement of 1964, who told the San Francisco Chronicle: “We have a saying in the movement that we don’t trust anybody over 30.” The saying went viral and became a favorite for reporters who wished to ridicule the mindset of the young, New Left. Meanwhile, at Occidental’s “safe space,” an Asian professor, whose gender was difficult to ascertain, refused to provide their name to  but offered to escort Nazarian out of the “safe space.” The professor claimed that administrators have expressed “discomfort” with ’s presence on campus because of the “conservative nature” of the publication. When a student began recording Nazarian, and Nazarian objected, she was told that “this is actually part of the protocol of maintaining community safety.” Nazarian then responded by pointing out that these same students were demanding that campus security remove their bullet proof vests as one of their 14 demands. A double shooting that left a husband dead and his wife severely wounded near Occidental College in 2013 prompted an increase in the protective equipment available to campus security, which is unarmed. Campus police officers Jasmine Vasquez told  News on Wednesday that the bulletproof vests are the only defense they have against harm: “We don’t have any other protection to defend ourselves. If we don’t have our vests, all we have is our voice and our hands.” Upon initially entering the occupied administration building, Nazarian had approached a professor who was sitting on a set of stairs conversing with a student. When asked if he would answer a few questions, he said he was not speaking with the media. Asked why, he said it was because the students asked him not to. Nazarian left the building shortly after the brief exchange. An NPR reporter who had just conducted an interview was not asked to leave and remained in the “safe space” unscathed.

        "articles": "“Some 70 Hollywood public relations firms are organizing a mass action against the Hollywood Foreign Press Association [HFPA],” reports TheWrap. What this means is that if the HFPA, which runs the Golden Globes, does not do some immediate affirmative action hiring of certain protected groups, all 87 members of the HFPA will be blacklisted. In other words, the Woke Gestapo will make it impossible for members of the HFPA to do their jobs. You see, it’s Hollywood PR firms that handle things like press junkets, screeners, screening invites, and interviews, etc. If you consider yourself a Hollywood journalist and are not in the good graces of these PR firms, you cannot do your job. TheWrap explains it this way: For example, the Marvel blockbuster “Black Widow” comes out on May 7, starring Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and others. Under this action, the stars would not be available for a press conference. The threatened blackout could be devastating to the HFPA, whose members make their living writing articles from press conferences and movie junkets with Hollywood stars. The proposed blackout comes as a new, post-COVID movie season is on the horizon, even as the HFPA has vowed to make immediate changes to its membership in the wake of the revelation that it has no Black members. So what is the HFPA doing wrong? Well, the HFPA is made up of 87 entertainment journalists from all around the world. They are the ones who vote for the Golden Globes, and now they are in trouble because not a single black person is a member of the HFPA. But it is not as if the HFPA is not already diverse, at least in the sense of the word as it appeals to Woketards. Obviously, there are no conservatives in the HFPA. Or, if there are, no one is saying so openly. As we all know, the Woketard defitinion of “diversity” has zero to do with intellectual diversity or cultural diversity, as far, Hey, let’s hire a Southerner! Nevertheless, the HFPA membership has more women than men and 35 percent of its membership is from outside European countries. That sounds pretty diverse to me. What’s fascinating (and not a little scary) about all this is that a major, cultural institution that has been around for decades, is in genuine jeopardy of being blacklisted into oblivion. Throughout this month’s Golden Globe awards, the HFPA was relentlessly shamed by its own presenters and winners. On top of that, the ratings were a flat-out catastrophe, a 60 percent drop from last year. The Woke Gestapo smell blood in the water, and are now circling for the kill. Let me tell you, just like their McCarthyite brethren from the 1950s, there is nothing these Nazis love more than the sense of self-righteousness that comes with feeling the power to destroy lives, reputations, and careers – or something as iconic as the Golden Globes. Better still, killing off the Golden Globes will give the Oscars and other award shows more attention and power. I will say this… In the 21st century, there’s no way to defend not having a black person in a worldwide club of 87, but the HFPA already knows this and says it is aggressively looking to rectify this wrong. Well, that no longer matters. There is no forgiveness among the Woke Nazis. There is no way back. Repentance is not allowed. EntertainmentMediaSocial JusticeBlacklistGolden GlobesJohn NolteWoke .

Cristina Alesci was reporting from outside a train station. The execrable Carol Costello was anchoring: Cristina Alesci: There’s going to be increasing questions about infrastructure, and whether infrastructure along this corridor can really handle the kind of capacity that it’s seen in the last couple of year, and how recent increases will really tax the system. Carol Costello: And it’s interesting, Cristina, because at 10 a.m. Eastern time the House Appropriations Committee will meet, and this was planned of course before this train accident happened, but on the agenda, lawmakers are considering cutting the Amtrak budget by hundreds of millions of dollars. The dead have not yet been counted. We have absolutely no idea what caused this crash. Moreover, Amtrak is already taxpayer subsidized to the tune of almost $1 billion a year. Mind you, not to help the poor, but to make it cheaper for the elite (including the media elite) to be able to sip a latte between Manhattan and Washington DC. Stating there’s “no proof,” here’s CNN “New Day” anchor Chris Cuomo brushing aside the idea that terrorism was the cause of the Amtrak derailment: — “@ShanPir: .@ChrisCuomo I hope this train derailment wasn’t “planned” “terrorist plot”.

        "articles": "On  News Sunday on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125 with  News Executive Chairman and host Stephen K. Bannon, Schweizer, regarded as the top expert on crony capitalism in the nation, said Republicans and Democrats in Washington, D.C. are like “two vultures fighting over a carcass.” He said both parties are fighting over “who’s going to pick at the carcass more.” He said the natural tendency of the Republican establishment is to “compromise and give away.” Schweizer mentioned that this was also the case during President Ronald Reagan’s tenure in office, when much of the Republican establishment that had loathed him, at least since 1976, wanted to “cut a deal with the Soviets.” Reagan did not, and Americans eventually saw the collapse of the “Evil Empire,” as Schweizer noted. Schweizer emphasized that the way to defeat the permanent political class–in particular, the Republican establishment–is to espouse the same “no compromise” approach Reagan espoused toward the Soviet Union. Looking back on 2013, the Tea Party and conservatives garnered victories on a host of issues–such as gun control and amnesty–because they did not go along with the Republican establishment, whose agenda is often more in line with President Barack Obama’s than the conservatives they purportedly represent. Even a Harvard professor conceded that such relentlessness will most likely enable the Tea Party to prevail in the end over a weakened GOP establishment. Ultimately, Schweizer said, despite establishment groups like the Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove’s American Crossroads can spend hundreds of millions of dollars waging war against conservatives, “what elects people is votes not dollars.” He said that the Republican establishment can spend “as much money as they want, but those candidates will have to appeal to Americans for votes.” In large swaths of the country, the Republican establishment’s message and policy objectives “do not resonate,” Schweizer said. Schweizer said strong conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) receive the most vitriol because the establishment is legitimately threatened by them. He also said that if the establishment genuinely thinks someone is a clown–they simply “laugh” at them–rather than waste their energies on them. In contrast, if the permanent political class thinks someone–like Cruz–can be, or is, “highly effective,” they get “angry and vicious.” Schweizer asserted that Cruz, especially when it came to the “widespread collusion” that is Obamacare, fought on principle, making it evident that he was not in Washington to “feather the pockets” of the permanent political class.

        "articles": "You may have noticed the glowing praise and admiration from the BBC for Sandi Toksvig’s new “Women’s Equality Party”, an organisation of limited relevance at present as it isn’t even fielding any candidates in the general election. The WEP’s policies for achieving “equality” include seeking “an end to violence against women” (presumably not violence against men) and Toksvig’s main contribution’s to ending sex discrimination thus far has been to write a book titled “Girls are best”. There’s not so much as a word of criticism or balance in the BBC’s article about the WEP, with Toksvig allowed to spread blatant lies about the gender pay gaps completely unchallenged. Such coverage is in stark contrast the men’s equality counterpart “Justice for Men and Boys”. Unlike Toksvig’s party, J4MB is indeed actually standing in this election, fielding two candidates in Nottinghamshire: party leader and author Mike Buchanan, and Ray Barry, known for his campaigning work on behalf of separated fathers. The party’s agenda essentially consists of bringing gender neutrality to UK laws and government polices, for example protecting all victims of genital mutilation and domestic violence, improving men’s healthcare, and tacking issues such as male suicide. It also strongly insists on meritocratic hiring policies, and therefore opposes sexist practices such as the use of all-women shortlists. Having been founded in 2013, the party made something of a media breakthrough In January this year, with countless newspaper interviews and media appearances, including an ITV “This Morning” interview, seen by over a million viewers. In spite of all this, even the BBC’s Men’s Hour program seems remarkably determined to refuse to acknowledge the party’s very existence, having failed to so much as to mention it in men’s politics related discussions, let alone invite a party representative onto the programme. The BBC website only contains three mentions of the party of any significance, every single one of which does little else other than attempt to undermine it by constantly questioning its necessity. The most recent mention on BBC East Midlands consisted of an angry radical feminist outraged at the very existence of a party that dares to help men and boys, and in a previous Women’s Hour radio “debate”former BBC presenter and Labour candidate John O’Farrell even referred to J4MB as “the male equivalent of the Klu Klux Klan” (an organisation who’s name he couldn’t even get right). This hostility and bias against the party from the BBC raised to a whole new level more recently, with an astonishing turn of events in BBC Radio Nottingham’s hustings debates. Firstly, the BBC refused to allow Barry to participate its Broxtowe constituency hustings broadcast, thereby restricting the party to one single hustings debate in Ashfield. This one and only J4MB-featured debate was scheduled for 23 April, and saw Buchanan pitted against shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, Gloria De Piero, who’d been selected by Labour by the sexist all-women shortlists to which J4MB were so verdantly opposed. Several days prior to broadcast, Buchanan discovered the BBC had decided to take the unusual step of theming much of the event around the issue of “why women’s votes could be so important at this election”. Further queries to the BBC concerning the format then revealed it had also imposed an all-female audience for Buchanan’s appearance. In other words, the BBC had not only decided to skew the debate directly away from men and towards women, it had also completely banned men from the only hustings event where there was a party actually wanting to discuss men’s issues. To put events into context, there are some 648 seats uncontested by J4MB where the BBC could have sought women’s views for a hustings event, yet of all these possible locations, they chose Ashfield for this most unique of formats. Not only had the BBC effectively imposed a nationwide ban on men interacting with their own political party, the rigged theme of the debate effectively served to bar J4MB from discussing any of its policies and the make up of the audience excluded much of J4MB’s core support. To further rub salt into J4MB’s wounds, the BBC even selected a female host, Sarah Julian, for the event. By the look of her Twitter account, Julian is a feminist who refuses to so much as touch touch any newspaper other than the Guardian. Julian’s involvement thus completed the total feminisation of the event and Buchanan was prevented from even interacting with a token male presenter. In spite of complaints from J4MB about the formant, the hustings proceeded as planned. During the broadcast Buchanan was clearly seething at how a supposedly impartial broadcaster had effective sabotaged his party’s one and only BBC hustings appearance. Instead of having the opportunity to challenge the record of his opponents or discuss policy, he was effectively forced to use his opening statement to highlight the astonishing misconduct of the BBC, rightly noting they should be “thoroughly ashamed” of what they had done. At times, the BBC’s ploy to stifle J4MB worked. The question format was such that Buchanan was always asked how he’d help women (and never men), of course his policies pertained to men, boys and families, therefore putting him on the back-foot before he’d even so much as considered his answer. To be honest, you’d have forgiven Buchanan if he was unsure whether his main opponents were the other candidates, the audience or the BBC itself. Anyone in his position might have been half expecting a modern day Jeremy Beadle to unmask themselves at some point and reveal the whole thing to have been an elaborate prank at his expense. In the end, Buchanan settled for a strategy of emphasising the farcical nature of the situation and he often chose to ignore the discriminatory questions completely. Whatever one’s view of J4MB, they, or any other party, have the right to feature in a hustings debate, and that debate should be conducted by a fair manner, with a neutral and representative audience and a relevant and diverse set of questions. If the J4MB manifesto focuses plight of men and boys in the UK they wish to attack misandrist feminists within the Labour Party, then it’s their democratic right to do so. The BBC has no business in attempting to shield incumbent Labour candidates from scrutiny and nor should they be involved in silencing and sidelining J4MB or any other party. I complained to Mike Bettison of BBC Nottingham about his station’s treatment of men and the only party set up to represent them. To be honest I was fully expecting some sort of standard BBC response, pretending the format had been a sheer coincidence and they were terribly sorry to have disadvantaged J4MB and ignored men’s voices. Incredibly, there was no such apology, and the reply I received openly admitted that the entire fiasco had been entirely pre-meditated, and the BBC intentionally selected J4MB’s (and De Piero’s) hustings for a female audience and women related topics! The following is taken from the BBC’s response: “As far as the Ashfield debate is concerned, we organised this to reflect the fact that gender differences have featured strongly in the election campaign. Mr Buchanan’s campaign is specifically raising the rights of men v women and he has chosen to stand against Gloria de Piero, a candidate who is closely identified with women’s issues. In fact her party has itself placed gender on the political agenda through its Pink Bus and associated campaigning. “ In these ways, Mr Buchanan and Ms Piero’s campaigns are linked – both have specific policies – whether it be, for example, changes to laws on abortion (J4MB) or changes to the provision of childcare (Labour) – which would have an impact on women . It is therefore editorially justified to unpick these issues in front of a female audience in a constituency where such issues have been placed on the agenda by two candidates. “ However, this was a one-off – all our other election coverage has been open to all – this has included two other hustings events and numerous phone-ins.“ So, the BBC rightly recognises a campaign about “gender differences”, about the respective rights of women and men, and about Labour’s Pink bus (and also J4MB’s battered old Ford Escort van). However, in this debate between a party wanting to discuss men’s issues and a feminist representing women, the BBC sides 100% with the later in every conceivable way. They eliminate each and every last male is from the audience, they gerrymander most of the questions to focus exclusively on women and to top it all off the whole event is controlled by an obligatory Guardian-reading feminist presenter. As to how the hell this ensures an impartial and balanced “debate on gender” as Bettison goes on to describe it in his email is beyond me. It’s clear the BBC firmly believe feminists have the right to absolute dominance of the narrative when it comes to gender issues. In the world of the BBC, it seems the concept of sexism against men simply doesn’t exist and anyone trying to raise such an idea must be silenced at all costs, even if it breaches all known BBC guidelines and completely ruins the broadcast for the audience. In retrospect, and in spite of the BBC’s blatant attempts to sabotage their election campaign, I’d actually argue J4MB still won the debate hands-down. Not because their answers were any better than the opposition, (after all, they couldn’t possibly have been thanks to the debate format). Nor did they win because of their policies, nor because of the reception they received (which at times included booing and angry women screeching “shame”). J4MB actually won the debate before it had even begun and did so without Buchanan so much as moving his lips. Why is this you may ask? Well, the BBC saw Buchanan’s platform as such a threat to their feminist agenda that they took the unprecedented step of completely throwing the BBC Charter and democracy out the window and intentionally sabotaged the sole hustings appearance of one of the county’s smallest political parties. In doing so, the broadcaster marginalised not only said party, but also men and boys, the many issues they face and advantaged women and feminist politicians too. The prevalence of these very phenomena in our society are at the core of all J4MB’s arguments and its philosophy, and so by showing we’re not even allowed to discuss such matters on an “impartial” broadcaster, the BBC proved J4MB’s point better than any speech or debate ever possibly could. If BBC resorts to such tactics, then it’s surely because they and Labour have no answers to Buchanan’s arguments. As for the losers of the debate, well it wasn’t any politician who lost but instead the licence fee payer, not to mention the Ashfield constituency electorate. Thanks to the BBC’s blatant contempt for men and boys (not to mention democracy itself), the voters of Nottingham had their money wasted on a farcical hustings event and were denied the chance to make an informed choice as to who to elect on Thursday. So, the next time you despair at the BBC’s blatant anti-UKIP or anti-Tory bias, perhaps spare a though for those who have it even worse than these parties and who have their campaigns activity sabotaged through license fee funded broadcasts. The next time you see one of Labour’s sexist segregated audiences, remember they’re actually still way-ahead of the BBC itself. And the next time you see Harriet Harman’s hideous pink bus, remember the BBC are not only firmly onboard, they’re probably in the driving seat too. London / EuropeMedia .

        "articles": "Islamic advocates ejected a  News reporter from a Sept. 21 news conference in Washington D.C. The Council on American-Islamic Relations was hosting the event to complain about Dr. Ben Carson’s criticism of Islamic intolerance. Ibrahim Hooper, an American convert to the 1,200 year-old religion, also threatened to eject the  reporter from any future conferences, and admitted in front of multiple TV cameras that he had ejected the reporter from a prior press conference. Speakers at the event included CAIR’s co-founder Nihad Awad and several others. “We believe in a conversation,” Awad said. “What unites us as Americans is…. our Constitution,” he claimed. At the end of the statements, Awad’s spokesman announced that ’s reporter would not be allowed to ask questions during the short question and answer period. Immediately after the question and answer session, Hooper intervened again to stop a conversation about Islam between  News and one of the speakers. “He is just one of the hate-mongers,” Hooper said about the  reporter. The CAIR speaker said he wanted to continue the conversation, but Hooper insisted that the reporter be forced out from the event. “Could you take it outside? We have you to leave. We have to ask him to leave. We have asked him to leave in previous news conferences, so we just ask you to leave, please,” Hooper said. To clarify: “Yes, I’m throwing you out,” Hooper added.  News asked Hooper if he would block this reporter from entering a future press event. “If I identify you before you come in, I won’t let you come in,” Hooper replied. “It is as simple as that… it is a private event and we don’t allow in hate-mongers like you,” he added, underlining his legal right to do something widely regarded as unethical, defensive and self-damaging. Awad arranged the press conference to criticize the Sept. 20 statement by GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson that: “I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation.” One of Carson’s aides later told CNN that “he was thinking like someone who loves America first, who wants to protect America.” The aide, Armstrong Williams, said that “he understands that there are tenets of Islam that hates Jews, that kills homosexuals, will kill Muslims, do not advocate belief and value systems that made America into the country that it is today.” Awad criticized Carson’s policy preferences as a violation of the Constitution. “We believe his views are inconsistent with the American Constitution,” said Awad, who has not been allowed to meet with FBI officials since the discovery of CAIR’s involvement in an extensive Islamist criminal operation in Texas. Awad’s intellectual error is understandable. Islamic ideology throughout the Arab world blends mosque and state, and views any criticism of Islam’s status or commandments as a violation of the fundamental law of the state. That’s not true in the United States, where morality and religion are kept distinct from law, and where politicians are expected to praise and criticize popular and unpopular ideas that are shielded by the Constitution from government hostility. Under questioning from reporters, Awad also insisted that Islam does separate religion from the state. “Within Islam, there is separation of state and religion” he claimed. In fact there are no or few Islamic states where Islam is not part of the state, or where other religions have equal rights to Islam. The Jordanian-born Awad also suggested that Carson’s policy preference is racist. That’s another categorical error because Islam is an ideology and a religion, not a racial group. In English, it is linguistically impossible to be racist towards an idea, especially an idea that deems itself to be non-racial. However, English is not Awad’s first language, and Islamic culture treats painful criticism as slander that can be punished, regardless of truth. Awad also tried to argue that Carson is treating all Muslims as a uniform bloc. However there’s no evidence that Carson cannot tell the difference between the ideas of Islam and the actions of individuals Muslims, who vary in their orthodoxy and piety. Again, the error is likely tied to Awad’s Islamic ideology, which does regard all Muslims as a worldwide bloc, called the “ummah.” Hooper’s exclusion of the press from the press conference also reflects the Islamists’ theological contempt for ideas and people outside Islam. For example, the Koran says that Christians and polytheists are “the worst of creatures.” That Koranic support for hate is especially powerful because of the Koran’s all-encompassing impact on Arab culture. Unlike the Christians’ Bible, which consists of questionable witness accounts of divine statements, such as “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God,” Muslims say the Koran is a perfect copy of Allah’s voluminous set of unappealable commandments. The Bible’s reliance on conflicting eyewitnesses has allowed Christianity to blend faith, reason, and debate, so allowing it to fundamentally change the world. The supremacist demands from Islamists are also funded on Koranic commands, which repeatedly says that non-Muslims should be fought until they accept a humiliating status in Islamic societies. “Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture – [fight] until they give the jizyah [a special tax] willingly while they are humbled.” Five former employees of CAIR who have been jailed or expelled were not able to attend the Sept. 21 press event. These days, Islamist are growing increasingly hostile to criticism as new evidence contradicts the Muslims’ explanation for their ideology, in just the same way that Christians’ world-view is being challenged by secular critics. Islamists say Islam was delivered to mankind in the early 600s by Allah’s last prophet, dubbed Mohammad. But the archeological evidence shows that Islam gradually developed in the 700s and 800s, likely as an Arab rival to the trinitarian Christianity that bolstered the political legitimacy of the nearby Byzantine empire. The Arabs’ Islamic religion rejects the Byzantine and Catholic vision of a trinity — Father, Son and the Holy Spirit — and insists on the “oneness” of their deity, dubbed “Allah,” who has supposedly set Arabs as the chosen people over the Jews and Christians. That emphasis on “oneness” explains why the symbol adopted by the ultra-orthodox Islamic State group is a single raised finger to the modern world. The linguistic evidence also suggests that Muhammad did not exist, because the origin of the name was actually a title, akin to “leader.” Nonetheless, the Arabs’ new religion worked to strengthen their power. Islamic armies finally captured Byzantium in 1453, although with the aid of cannons built by Bulgarian mercenaries. However, by then the Arab kingdoms had long been captured by Islamicized Turks, who converted to Islam after they migrated in from central Asia.

        "articles": "Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani told reporters on Wednesday that he turned down five requests from U.S. President Barack Obama to meet at the United Nations, according to Iran’s semi-official Fars News Agency. Rouhani said: “Before my trip (to New York), the Americans had sent 5 messages to arrange a meeting between me and Obama, but I turned them down.” “Then they raised a plan for a brief meeting, but I didn’t agree (with it) much; we didn’t disagree with (the idea to have) a meeting, but its grounds weren’t prepared.” The Iranian leader also said that he had achieved his mission at the UN “to prevent a new war in the region,” and he mocked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his strident speech earlier in the week, saying that Israel is merely frustrated that its own power has declined as Iran’s power has grown. The White House had stoked media anticipation last week by indicating the possibility of a meeting between President Obama and President Rouhani on the sidelines of the UN before Rouhani turned down the suggestion. That was the only known snub before Rouhani claimed to have denied Obama an additional five times. The two leaders spoke by telephone instead–the first such contact between the two nations in three decades. National SecurityBenjamin NetanyahuIranWhite House .

        "articles": "Thesubhead for her piece is, “Incredulity hurts victims more than it hurtswrongly-accused perps.” Maxwell attempts to back this up by making agreater-good argument. She points to evidence that the overall reporting of rape is below 50 percent of the actual number and that, according to some research, the incidence of false reportsis below 10 percent. Therefore, Maxwell concludes, by merely looking atthe numbers, more people will be helped than harmed by erring on the side of the accusers. Ultimately,the costs of wrongly disbelieving a survivor far outweigh the costs ofcalling someone a rapist. Even if Jackie fabricated her account, U-Va.should have taken her word for it during the period while theyendeavored to prove or disprove the accusation. This is not a legalargument about what standards we should use in the courts; it’s a moralone, about what happens outside the legal system. The accusedwould have a rough period. He might be suspended from his job; friendsmight defriend him on Facebook. In the case of Bill Cosby, we might haveto stop watching his shows, consuming his books or buying tickets tohis traveling stand-up routine. But false accusations are exceedinglyrare, and errors can be undone by an investigation that clears theaccused, especially if it is done quickly. At the 30,000 foot level, Maxwell’s argument may at first sounds reasonable but there is an obvious problem with it.Another way to look at presuming the truthfulness of the accuser is presuming the guilt of the accused. Thismay be appropriate for crisis counselors or anyone receiving a firstreport of a serious crime like rape, but it’s obviously not how ourjustice system works overall and for good reason. In our system, the accused is innocentuntil proven guilty. The more serious the accusation — and rape iscertainly one of the most serious crimes one can allege — the moreserious the potential consequences. But seriousconsequences necessitate a high standard of proof and are only applied after an impartialjudge or jury reaches a decision about guilt in accordance with thelaw. What Maxwell seems to be arguing for is what might becalled Red Queen justice, i.e. “sentence first, verdict afterwards.”Saying, as Maxwell does, “the accused would have a rough period,” andadding that the consequences could be lost friends on Facebook,substantially downplays the potential impact of a rape accusation on the accused. As Emily Yoffe points out in a lengthy piece published at Slatetoday, the penalties associated with an unfair accusation can belife-altering. Yoffe tells the story of Drew Sterrett, a freshman at theUniversity of Michigan who had sex with a young woman referred to as CBafter both had been drinking. CB came into Drew’s room, got in his bedand then: They talked quietly, started kissing, andthen things escalated, as they often do when two teenagers are in bedtogether. When it became clear they were going to have intercourse, CBasked Sterrett about a condom, and he retrieved one from a drawer. Theirsex became so loud and went on for so long that Sterrett’s roommate,unable to sleep in the upper bunk, sent Sterrett a Facebook messagearound 3 a.m.: “Dude, you and [CB] are being abnoxtiously [sic] loud andinconsiderate, so expect to pay back in full tomorrow …” Overthe following summer, Drew was contacted by the University’s Office ofStudent Conflict Resolution to arrange an interview on Skype. It wasonly in the midst of the interview he realized his night with CB hadbecome an issue of controversy. Despite evidence that CB was awilling participant in what took place and evidence that her problemwith the incident only began after her mother read herdiary, Drew was judged guilty of breaking University policy. In hissophomore year he was given a badly misleading “statement of witnesses”summary prepared by the University as a kind of draft of what the finalreport would find. Drew pointed out serious errors in thesummary. For instance, it suggested he had admitted a non-consensualencounter to his roommate. In fact, as the roommate confirmed in anaffidavit, Drew was merely, “expressing regret for sleeping with someone in their group of friends.” Inthe end Drew was found guilty of having intercourse without consent andcreating a “hostile environment.” He was suspended from school until CBgraduated in 2016. After two more appeals Drew chose not to return toschool. This year he filed a lawsuit against the University claiming “his 14th Amendment rights of due process” had been violated. As Yoffe explains, the mindset behind the treatment of Drew is spreading with the help of the federal government: Unfortunately,under the worthy mandate of protecting victims of sexual assault,procedures are being put in place at colleges that presume the guilt ofthe accused. Colleges, encouraged by federal officials, are institutingsolutions to sexual violence against women that abrogate the civilrights of men. Schools that hold hearings to adjudicate claims of sexualmisconduct allow the accuser and the accused to be accompanied by legalcounsel. But as Judith Shulevitz noted in the New Republic in October,many schools ban lawyers from speaking to their clients (only notes canbe passed). During these proceedings, the two parties are not supposedto question or cross examine each other, a prohibition recommended bythe federal government in order to protect the accuser. And by federalrequirement, students can be found guilty under the lowest standard ofproof: preponderance of the evidence, meaning just a 51 percentcertainty is all that’s needed for a finding that can permanently alterthe life of the accused. Losing a chance to attendUniversity and having a permanent stain on one’s record is quite a bitmore serious than losing a few Facebook friends. ZerlinaMaxwell simply assumes that errors in the early stages will be, “undoneby an investigation.” Butthat’s clearly not what happened to Drew. There was a process of somekind taking place but that process does not seem to have been handled fairly or impartially. How impartial can an investigation beif the body in charge has as its first principle the presumption thatthe accuseris telling the truth? Maxwell doesn’t seem to grasp that these twothings are at odds with one another. Maxwell’s piece is written in response to the partial collapse of the UVA gang-rape story (Jackie’s story) published last month by Rolling Stone. Last week the Washington Post published evidence and interviews suggesting some of the details relayed by Rolling Stone were false. Rolling Stone apologized twice on Friday for failing to properly report the story. Jackie’sstory may be the exception but it’s also agood example of how a desire to believe the accuser and to presume theguilt of the accused may not lead to the truth (Rolling Stone nevercontacted any of the seven accused rapists). That’s not to say nothinghappened to Jackie or that her accusers are innocent of all wrongdoing.Multiple people have attested that something serious happened to herthat night which dramatically changed her demeanor. However a decisionabout consequences for those accused should follow not precede the bestpossible fact-finding into the incident in question. PoliticsCrimeRolling StoneWashington Post .

        "articles": "Texas Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz declared, “Republican leadership is standing with Barack Obama in supporting the funding of Planned Parenthood” in an interview broadcast on Wednesday’s “Hannity” on the Fox News Channel. Cruz, after stating that Republican leadership wants “to engage in show votes, but not actually win anything.” And wants a “show vote” on Planned Parenthood “an ongoing national criminal enterprise,” before they “acquiesce to Obama,” was asked [relevant exchange begins around 6:00] “you have said you would not support any CR if it includes funding for Planned Parenthood. Do you have the support of other Republicans, considering the release of these videos in recent weeks?” Cruz answered, “Sadly, right now, we don’t. Republican leadership is standing with Barack Obama in supporting the funding of Planned Parenthood. Let me tell you how they’re doing it. What Barack Obama has said is he will veto any funding for the federal government unless it includes $500 million of taxpayer money going to Planned Parenthood. So, Obama is holding the entire federal government hostage, every agency of the federal government. And what Republican leadership does is it unilaterally surrenders. It says, well, — the major tool Congress has, is the power of the purse, under the Constitution, and every time Congress threatens to use it, Obama says he’ll veto it. And so the position of [Sen. Mitch] McConnell (R-KY) and [Rep. John] Boehner (R-OH) is they will not fight for anything unless Obama agrees to it and won’t veto it. You know what, if that’s the case, what the heck is the difference between them and [Sen.] Harry Reid (D-NV) and [Rep.] Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) if Obama sets all the priorities? And you know, one of the illustrations, today, there’s a big Wall Street Journal editorial slamming me because I’m urging Republicans to actually follow through on our commitments and defund Planned Parenthood.

        "articles": "The Associated Press appears to be siding against free speech with its latest tweet attacking free speech advocate Pamela Geller by knocking her as unapologetic that two terrorists were killed during her weekend event. To flog its latest story on Geller, the AP’s tweet pointedly notes that Geller has “no regrets” over the death of the two Islamists. PHOTO: Pamela Geller at AP headquarters, where she said she had no regrets over TX cartoon contest that left 2 dead:  — The Associated Press (@AP) May 8, 2015 The article the tweet links to is no better with its title: “Activist: No Regrets About Cartoon Contest Ended by Gunfire.” Note that the AP seems to be more worried about the deaths of the terrorists than in free speech, here. All the negative focus is on Geller somehow being uncaring that the Islamists were killed. “Does Pamela Geller regret organizing the Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest that ended in gunfire?” the AP tsk tsks in its very first sentence. It doesn’t appear to have occurred to the AP that the two would-be killers wouldn’t be dead if they didn’t go to the event with guns blazing in the first place. A better question might be whether terrorists regret attacking free speech, or throwing gays off buildings, or hanging them by the neck from cranes, or “honor killing” women and girls, or a host of other Islamist outrages? Still, Geller more than holds her own in an article meant to attack her. “I will continue to speak in defense of freedom until the day I die,” Geller told the Associated Press. “It’s just that simple. It’s not even a choice. It’s a calling.” Just as it’s apparently a calling for the AP to attack free speech.

        "articles": "Within hours of Cantor’s defeat, though, the House GOP caucus rallied around his deputy, House Whip Kevin McCarthy, to replace him as number two in leadership. Rather than reflect on whether Cantor’s loss signaled a larger issue, Republicans circled the wagons to preserve the status quo. This is a bit like Lincoln replacing McClellan with the general’s less-accomplished twin brother. Ever since the 17th century tulip mania in Holland, economic prognosticators have worried about financial bubbles. In these situations, the valuations of assets or commodities are pushed higher than economic logic would dictate. As the recent 2008 housing and credit collapse revealed, these events never end well. Whether or not we are in another Fed-induced financial bubble is a question for economic history. It seems clear, in any event, that DC is experiencing a political bubble. Incumbents and strategists of both parties are completely out of touch with the concerns of average Americans. The public seems increasingly aware that the nation is facing intractable challenges. In response, Republicans and Democrats offer pablum, wired and duct-taped together to get past another election cycle. Unfortunately, the biggest worry gripping DC in response to the Cantor loss is how his departure will impact Wall Street and big banks, who were strong allies of the Majority Leader. There is even worry that, without Cantor, the crony capitalist Export-Import Bank, which gives government-backed financing to major corporations, may expire. Oh, the horror. There is perhaps no better example of how out-of-touch DC is with the rest of America than the following tweet from senior GOP “strategist” John Feehery, in reaction to MS Sen. Thad Cochran being forced into a run-off. I guess Mississippi doesn’t want Federal money anymore. I betcha there are 49 states that will gladly take it. — John Feehery (@JohnFeehery) June 4, 2014 The notion that voters should support a politician solely on the ability to extract more money out of the Treasury is precisely how a nation accumulates a $17 trillion debt. This rather petulent sentiment, mind you, comes from a Republican. Last week, the National Republican Senatorial Committee hosted a fundraiser for Sen. Cochran’s run-off which brought over $800,000 into the embattled politician’s campaign coffers from various corporations and DC interests. This money isn’t to finance a fight against a Democrat, but against a fellow Republican who bested 40-year incumbent Cochran in the initial primary balloting. Cochran’s campaign is also banking on support from anti-gun Michael Bloomberg and Facebook co-founder and left-wing donor Sean Parker. Making the short drive into DC from my home, I can count half-a-dozen construction cranes. There are at least four major housing developments within a mile of my house. Living in DC, one can easily miss the economic anxiety felt by people outside the beltway. Eric Cantor’s campaign famously spent more money at DC steakhouses than his challenger Brat spent on his entire campaign. It is a funny stat, but there is a more telling anecdote. On primary election day, Cantor was in DC, 90 miles away from his district, huddling with lobbyists and fundraisers at a Starbucks on Capitol Hill. The National Journal‘s Ron Fournier, one of the few generally interesting reporters in DC, perfectly summarized what DC ought to learn from Cantor’s loss. Let this be the lesson taken from Cantor’s loss. He is not the only political leader to lose touch with voters. In fact, according to every indication, the entire political class has lost touch. There is ample polling to suggest that a majority of Americans voters don’t feel rooted in, or represented by, either the Republican or Democratic parties. Change or lose power, folks. Bubbles don’t last. As the great economist Herb Stein said, roughly, that which can’t go on, stops. DC can’t forever stay out-of-touch with the public. The bubble will burst.

        "articles": "Thursday while President Barack Obama was hosting a town hall in Fairfax, VA broadcasted on CNN about his gun policy, Chris Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action, reacted to Obama’s effort on Fox News Channel’s “The Kelly File.” Cox downplayed the town hall and said Obama was not being forthright with his intentions. “Let’s be clear what this is really about,” Cox said. “This president is trying to create an illusion that he’s doing something to keep people safe. He needs to do that because the truth is his policies have failed miserably. We saw that materialize itself in San Bernardino when we had a terrorist attack. This president didn’t use it as an opportunity to unite this country. He didn’t use it as an opportunity to lay out a plan to defeat terrorism. He used it as an opportunity to impose more gun control on law-abiding Americans. Cox next explained to host Megyn Kelly why his organization declined an invitation to participate in the town hall, which he claimed was a result of being allowed to only ask one pre-screened question of the president. “This is an attempt to distract the American people away from his failed policies,” Cox explained. “So did we participate in CNN’s event tonight? No, we didn’t. We were offered one pre-screened question. Megyn, I know that you don’t send your questions over to the White House so I would rather have a conversation with you that’s intellectually honest than sit through a lecture and get one opportunity to ask a pre-screened question.” Despite Obama having said he would be willing to meet with the NRA in his town hall, Cox dismissed that possibility. “This president can talk about background checks all day long. But that’s nothing more than a distraction away from the fact that he can’t keep us safe and he supported every gun control proposal that’s ever been made,” he added. “He doesn’t support the individual right to own a firearm. That’s been the position of his Supreme Court nominees. That’s been the position of his administration. So what are we going to talk about, basketball? I’m not really interested in going over and talking to the president who doesn’t have a basic level of respect or understanding of the Second Amendment and law-abiding gun owners in this country.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor 2nd AmendmentClipsPoliticsBarack ObamaChris CoxGunsNational Rifle Associationtown hall .

        "articles": "A transgender high school wrestler was booed, after he beat a female competitor to advance to the state championships on Saturday. Wrestler Mack Beggs, a Euless Trinity senior from Euless, Texas, was booed after pinning female contestant Kayla Fitts of Cypress Ranch at the UIL state tournament in Cypress, Texas, according to WFAA, an ABC affiliate. Beggs drew criticism last year for joining the female wrestling team when his parents claimed he was beginning the “transition” from female to male, using a testosterone regimen therapy. Opponents sued the school claiming that the testosterone gave the student an unfair advantage against his female opponents. Despite the lawsuit, the transitioning student went on to win last year’s Class 6A girls championship in the 110-pound division. Beggs was able to continue wrestling with girls despite the testosterone treatments in part because in 2016 the state’s governing body, the University Interscholastic League (UIL), had ruled that students had to compete in the gender class that appears on their birth certificates. The UIL also noted that the student’s testosterone treatment doesn’t fall under banned substances because a doctor prescribed the drug. Last year, Beggs’ parents claimed that their “son” was an “inspiration” to others. “He inspires a lot of people, and if he can help just one person — then it’s worth it to Mack,” said the student’s father, Marco Karem. Still, other parents at the school say that despite everyone’s support for Beggs’ “transitioning,” he shouldn’t be allowed to compete in a contest of strength among other girls.

        "articles": "Donald Trump’s pledge to parents that he would end the controversial Common Core standards and finally get Washington, D.C. out of education is ready to be tested. While on the campaign trail, the president-elect described Common Core as a “disaster,” and said that the federal government should leave education to states and local school districts. Some of the names on what has been released as Trump’s short list of candidates for education secretary, however, are troublesome to grassroots parent activists and others fighting to bring education choices back to the states and localities – where the Constitution says those decisions belong. “Some of the names being floated as possible Secretary of Education are troubling,” explains Jane Robbins, education fellow at American Principles Project. “Trump’s most consistent education-related commitment during the campaign was to end Common Core and restore local control, and that won’t happen if the Department of Education is run by someone who has supported or protected Common Core in the past.” The list of possible candidates includes many Common Core supporters as well as those who backed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush – a champion of the unpopular standards: “Mr. Trump needs to listen to the grassroots forces who are relying on him to restore local autonomy in education,” Robbins says. Heartland Institute education fellow Joy Pullmann tells  News there is much Trump can do to make good on his pledge to end Common Core. “Unlike the media, which insisted on explaining Trump’s statements hyperliterally, Trump’s voters heard their candidate tell them he’s with us in opposition to running the nation’s schools from Washington D.C., she explains. “That’s what it means to oppose Common Core. As president, Trump can do a lot to fulfill this promise.” Pullmann continues: For example, under both parties for decades, the federal government has funded and graded states’ curriculum mandates and tests, a mechanism that greased the skids for Common Core and has kept them greased for Common Core’s inevitable successor. With Congress, Trump can and should end this practice. In keeping with federal law, the federal government should have nothing whatsoever to do with funding or evaluating curriculum and tests. It should all be given back to the states and their people. Pullmann also points to Trump’s pledge to get Washington out of education policy. President Jimmy Carter instituted the U.S. Department of Education in 1979. “The U.S. Department of Education needs to be drastically right-sized,” she says, adding: Its power over state education bureaucrats is another factor that greased the skids for Common Core. Congress should write and President Trump should sign a new law cutting the department down to a mere auditor’s office that no longer employs bureaucrats who tell us what children should learn, when, and how. Instead, the department should send states their own money and power back and let we, the people decide how to run our own affairs, as Trump also promised in his acceptance speech would characterize his presidency. The Common Core is a federally promoted education initiative introduced in the Obama administration’s 2009 stimulus bill through a competitive grant program called Race to the Top (RttT). States could apply and compete for federal grant money and waivers from federal regulations as long as they adopted a set of uniform standards and aligned curricula, agreed to a massive system of student data collection, and signed onto a teacher evaluation system that would be based in part on student performance on assessments aligned with the standards. The standards were developed by three private organizations in Washington D.C.: the National Governors Association (NGA), the Council for Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), and progressive education company Achieve Inc. All three organizations were privately funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and none of these groups are accountable to parents, teachers, students, or taxpayers. Eventually, 46 states signed onto the unproven Common Core standards with little, if any, public or media scrutiny, and most of them prior to their state boards of education even seeing the standards themselves. Parent activist groups have met with substantial resistance from both Republican and Democrat governors and state legislators in their quest to repeal Common Core in the states. Political pressure from big business groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce – a major supporter of Common Core – and the threat of having federal funds pulled from their states, led most state lawmakers and governors to dismiss parental concerns. The 2016 annual Education Next poll shows that public support for the Common Core State Standards has fallen to a record low. According to the survey, support for the Common Core education plan dropped to 50 percent this year, down from 58 percent in 2015 and from 83 percent in 2013. The poll finds that, among teachers, support for the program has dropped from 87 percent in 2013, to 54 percent in 2014, to 44 percent in 2015, and continuing at that level in 2016. In addition, since 2011, state membership in the two federally funded consortia developed to create Common Core-aligned tests has dropped by 62 percent. A recent report by ACT – the nonprofit that developed the college admissions and placement test administered to more than 1.8 million high school graduates annually – found that only 16 percent of college professors said their incoming students were well prepared overall for college-level work, down from 26 percent in 2009 and 2012, a stunning outcome considering Common Core proponents’ primary selling point for the standards has been that they will make U.S. students “college and career ready.” Pullmann herself also reported in January at The Federalist that Common Core is estimated to have cost the nation as a whole $80 billion, in addition to the costs to individual states that have seen the tab for the education reform skyrocket. “The way to end Common Core is to end the superstructures that made it not just possible but inevitable,” she says. “Even though Common Core is technically off-limits for federal influence, its successors will soon arise, and they will be worse than Common Core–unless President Trump fulfills his promise to his voters to end Common Core once and for all.” “He can do this by defunding the education establishment taxpayers currently pay to oppress us, and sending states’ education dollars back to them for parents and local voters to manage themselves,” she explains. “Common Core is a hydra that consumes federal education dollars. The only way to kill it for good is to stop feeding it. Give us our own money and power back, and Common Core will never happen again.” In addition, Pullmann observes that Trump can strike a mortal blow to another major lever in the massive Common Core boondoggle – student data collection. “Trump can put a stake into Common Core by killing the national student information databases the U.S. Department of Education has been paying states to construct in violation of laws forbidding a national surveillance system,” she states. “It interacts with Common Core and expands its reach from birth through a person’s career.” Writing at Cato, education director Neal McCluskey agrees that while the federal incentive levers to the states – Race to the Top and No Child Left Behind waivers – are no longer in operation, Trump and a Republican Congress can ensure the regulations associated with the new massive education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), don’t “coerce the use of the Core or any other specific standards or tests.” In a press release following the House’s passage of ESSA, potential Trump education secretary candidate Rep. Messer described the bill, as “a new approach to the federal role in education. It gives power over education back to the people we trust— local administrators, teachers and parents who are best-positioned to make decisions for our students.” Robbins, however, writing at The Pulse 2016, observed, “ESSA lays out particular requirements for state standards and uses code language throughout that gives the federal government the tools to pressure the states to stick with Common Core rather than risking their federal money by adopting something better.” “It maintains the federally dictated testing regimen and requires states to implement assessments that are expensive, that have been proven to be ineffective and unworkable, and that operate not by assessing students’ academic knowledge but rather by measuring their attitudes and dispositions,” she concluded. “This has been a real concern,” McCluskey explains. “While the spirit and rhetoric surrounding the ESSA is about breaking down federal strictures, the Obama education department has been drafting regulations that threaten federal control over funding formulas and accountability systems. And the statute includes language vague enough that it could allow federal control by education secretary veto.” “A Trump administration would likely avoid that,” he says, and notes as well that Trump’s supporters “don’t seem inclined to do what Beltway types tell them.” EducationPoliticsCommon CoreDonald Trumpfederal overreachlocal control of educationNeal McCluskeyTrump cabinet .

        "articles": "President Donald Trump is still considering delivering a major speech to the country next week, despite his decision to postpone his State of the Union address. Former Deputy Assistant to the president Sebastion Gorka revealed in an interview with  News Daily on Sirius XM Patriot Channel 125 on Thursday that supporters should not be surprised if Trump ended up speaking to the country anyway. “It might not be called the State of the Union, but there will be an address, from a very very interesting location, held very soon by the president,” Gorka said. Gorka now hosts his own radio show “America First” on the Salem Radio Network. Gorka and other talk radio hosts met with the president last week for an off the record meeting to discuss the ongoing shutdown. The White House did not confirm or deny any of the president’s plans when contacted by  News for comment. On Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rescinded her invitation to the president to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday, January 29. Trump conceded late Wednesday night that he would postpone his State of the Union address at Pelosi’s request. The idea of a speech on the same day of the State of the Union address continues to get traction amongst conservative supporters of the president. “There really is one State of the Union speech and that happens in Congress, so any other speech wouldn’t really technically be a State of the Union,” American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp said in an interview with  News on Thursday. Schlapp and other conservatives met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, shortly after Pelosi made her decision to postpone the president’s speech. Schlapp said he was surprised by the president’s decision to postpone the speech, noting that he did not indicate that decision during the meeting. He did not confirm or deny rumors about the president’s upcoming plans but indicated that it made sense. “My guess is we’ll be hearing and seeing more around his strategy of taking this fight to the people,” Schlapp said. “He should give a major speech that same day, it’s just not the State of the Union, let’s be candid.” PoliticsAmerican Conservative UnionDonald TrumpMatt SchlappSebastian GorkaState of the Union Address .

        "articles": "Dartmouth University’s Alumni Relations department has concluded that no student will be punished for the Black Lives Matter incident last year, where activists stormed a library on campus and hurled racial abuse at students. In November it was reported that a 150-person strong group of BLM protesters stormed the campus study space, screaming racially motivated chants such as, “Fuck you, you filthy white fucks!”, “Fuck you and your comfort!”, and “Fuck you, you racist shits!” One girl was even reported to have been pinned by protesters against a wall, who allegedly shouted “filthy white bitch” in her face. Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ing-Lise Ameer defended the protesters’ actions shortly after, claiming that the violent demonstration “needed to be done.” Despite the actions of Black Lives Matter demonstrators at Dartmouth University, who also destroyed a Blue Lives Matter police memorial at the school earlier this month, Alumni Relations Assistant Director Meg Ramsden released the following statement in response: After concluding its investigation with respect to the complaints and studying what was seen in the video in Baker-Berry Library, it was determined there were no specific violations of the Standards of Conduct. In essence, no rules for which there are recorded and communicated sanctions were broken. While nothing that occurred in the library was found to be in violation of the Standards of Conduct, the spirit of the recent Moving Dartmouth Forward Citizenship Pledge was clearly violated. The pledge, however, is aspirational not actionable. There are no defined sanctions in place if it is not upheld, and some alumni feel perhaps there should be. The code reflects a standard we hope all community members will strive to achieve in their interactions with one another. Students were counseled in serious conversations about judgment, the pledge of citizenship and behaviour appropriate within a civil community… Despite the reluctance to sanction any of the protesters involved in the incident, Ramsden did reiterate that “abusive language aimed at any of our community members – by any group, at any time, in any place – is not acceptable” before pulling the “freedom of speech” card that is so rarely afforded to conservatives when they want something as simple as a speaker to attend their campus: Freedom of speech is mission critical. In these cases when it is a struggle to find the balance between that freedom and respectful behavior, it’s imperative that the Dartmouth community affirms its core principles of respect for every member of the community and everyone’s right of freedom of expression, and then reflect on the mistakes made against the backdrop of a commitment to civil discourse. The standards of the First Amendment are what we used to guide this process. EducationSocial JusticeTechBlack Lives MatterDartmouth . Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

        "articles": "The numbers provided are in graphics and are broken down into “OFO” and “OBP.” The Customs and Border Protection agency is divided into the Office of Field Operations (OFO) and the Office of Border Patrol (OBP). The OFO numbers reflect anyone either turning themselves in at official U.S. points of entry, or anyone caught while being smuggled at the points of entry. The OBP numbers reflect anyone being caught or turning themselves in to Border Patrol agents between the points of entry, or anyone caught at interior checkpoints by Border Patrol agents. The “OFO Inadmissible” designation to any individual from a nation other than Mexico or Canada means that U.S. authorities took the individuals into custody. Whether they were deported or given a Notice to Appear is unknown. It is important to note these numbers do not include data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The unavailable ICE data are in addition to these numbers. The report reveals the apprehension numbers ranging from 2010 through July 2014. It shows that most of the human smuggling from Syria and Albania into the U.S. comes through Central America. The report also indicates the routes individuals from North Africa and the Middle East take into the European Union, either to illegally migrate there or as a possible stop in their journey to the United States. The data are broken down further into the specific U.S. border sectors where the apprehensions and contact occurred. Among the significant revelations are that individuals from nations currently suffering from the world’s largest Ebola outbreak have been caught attempting to sneak across the porous U.S. border into the interior of the United States. At least 71 individuals from the three nations affected by the current Ebola outbreak have either turned themselves in or been caught attempting to illegally enter the U.S. by U.S. authorities between January 2014 and July 2014. As of July 20, 2014, 1,443 individuals from China were caught sneaking across the porous U.S. border this year alone, with another 1,803 individuals either turning themselves in to U.S. authorities at official ports of entry, or being caught attempting to illegally enter at the ports of entry. This comes amid a massive crackdown by Chinese authorities of Islamic terrorists in the Communist nation. Twenty-eight individuals from Pakistan were caught attempting to sneak into the U.S. this year alone, with another 211 individuals either turning themselves in or being caught at official ports of entry. Thirteen Egyptians were caught trying to sneak into the U.S. this year alone, with another 168 either turning themselves in or being caught at official ports of entry. Four individuals from Yemen were caught attempting to sneak into the U.S. by Border Patrol agents in 2014 alone, with another 34 individuals either turning themselves in or being caught attempting to sneak through official ports of entry. Yemen is not the only nation with individuals who pose terror risks to the U.S. that the report indicates travel from. The failed nation of Somalia, known as a hotbed of Islamic terror activity, was also referenced in the report. Four individuals from Somalia were caught trying to sneak into the U.S. by Border Patrol agents in 2014. Another 290 either turned themselves in or were caught attempting to sneak in at official ports of entry. This reporter previously covered the issue of illegal immigration into the U.S. from Somalia and other nations in the Horn of Africa.

        "articles": "“Five hundred billion dollars…that makes the cartel business and the and the drug traffic just in Mexico coming across to the United States bigger than Walmart, so this is larger than our largest companies,” Perdue said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said the drug trade in the U.S. is valued anywhere from $426 to $652 billion dollars. “I think we all know the drug trade in this country is really big business,” she said. “Its reach is global, its distribution is growing, its leadership is criminal. Like any business it adapts to market changes. Its motivation is power and profit at any costs.” Walmart brought in $500.34 billion in net sales in 2018, according to Statista. The hearing held by the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control drew broad agreement from both sides of the aisle that drug trafficking into the U.S. was getting worse, as well as the numbers of Americans dying from drug abuse. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), chairman of the caucus, said drug poisoning deaths remain the leading cause of death and injury in the U.S. “In American alone in 2017, more than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses,” he said. “The idea that we would somehow lose 70,000 Americans in one year alone to drug overdoses and not consider this a national emergency is really staggering,” he said. He added that since 2006, Mexico has seen 150,000 people murdered from cartel violence. Perdue added: “If a cartel was sending a cruise missile into Dallas, Texas and killing 70,000 people, I think our response would be a little less measured than it is today.” Feinstein, co-chairman of the caucus, said in California nearly 5,000 died in 2017, and worldwide it was 450,000 lives in 2015. “These estimates don’t consider the lives lost due to the violence associated with this illicit trade,” she said. She added that this year, 22 countries have been identified as major transit or source countries for illicit drugs. More than 133,000 pounds of heroin, cocaine, meth, and fentanyl were seized in the U.S. last year, and nearly 101,000 pounds have already been seized this year. Cornyn said there has been a dramatic increase in synthetic opioid-related deaths with the emergence of fentanyl as a significant contributor. However, he said the traffickers were “commodity agnostic.” “They’ll traffic in drugs, migrants, in human beings for sex slavery, money laundering, counterfeit goods, whatever will make them a buck,” he said. “The groups fueling this cycle are becoming richer and growing their influence in the United States, and without intervention, their power will only grow,” he said. “It’s not hyperbole to say we’ve reached a crisis point,” he said. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who was invited to testify on the State Department’s efforts to counter the global drug trade, said the issue was “personal” for him. “I know many people that have been impacted by this set of issues. Just last month, there were seven Kansans who died in a ten hour period from a single overdose of cocaine laced with fentanyl,” he added. “This is a serious matter… We all know human lives that have been touched, and families that have been ripped apart by this.” He said in terms of efforts by the State Department, the Trump administration has focused on China, due to the increase of fentanyl flooding into the U.S. over the past several years. He said the U.S. is working with Chinese officials to shut down labs inside China. In Latin America, he said Mexico remains a production hub for methamphetamines and heroin, and a transit country for cocaine and fentanyl and other drugs. However, he said when President Trump recently raised the specter of tariffs on Mexico, more progress was made “in the course of a couple of days” than in his time in office of just over a year. “I think it focused the attention of all of us….and made us more willing to set up true metrics,” he said. Pompeo’s appearance was the first time a cabinet member appeared before the committee, Cornyn said.

        "articles": "A British Columbia (BC) Supreme Court judge has found the father of a 14-year-old girl claiming to be transgender guilty of “family violence” because he continued to refer to his daughter as “she.” An order of protection issued by Justice Francesca Marzari states the father, known as “Clark,” is subject to arrest if he attempts to “persuade” his daughter, known as “Maxine,” to “abandon treatment for gender dysphoria,” to call her by her birth name, or to refer to her “as a girl or with female pronouns,” either “directly or to third parties.” The court order states the father’s arrest may occur “immediately” and “without warrant” by a police officer “who has reasonable and probable grounds” to enforce the order. Jeremiah Keenan reported at The Federalist Marzari’s ruling that the father had engaged in “expressions of rejection of [his daughter’s] gender identity.” The girl’s father would not refer to his daughter as “he,” and he continued to affirm publicly that his daughter is a biological female. The report continued: What Marzari found particularly egregious, however, was not Clark’s private interactions with his daughter but his “continued willingness to provide interviews to the media … in which he identifies [Maxine] as female, uses a female name for [Maxine] … and expresses his opposition to the therapies [Maxine] has chosen.” According to the court, this willingness placed Maxine at “a significant risk of harm.” In February, the BC Supreme Court ordered that Maxine undergo hormone treatments, against the consent of her father. As a result, the teen has since begun regular testosterone injections at BC Children’s Hospital. The teen’s school counselor reportedly urged her to identify as a boy while in seventh grade. When she was 13, Dr. Brenden Hursh at BC Children’s Hospital encouraged her to begin the injections to enable her to gain a more masculine appearance. “[These injections] will completely disrupt her puberty,” the father told The Federalist. “Her bones will stop growing, her brain will stop developing … and she’s not gonna be a boy. She won’t even have the bone-strength left to be a girl anymore.” Justice Bowden, however, said Maxine was “exclusively entitled to consent to medical treatment for gender dysphoria,” regardless of the opposition her parents expressed. “The government has taken over my parental rights,” the father said. “They’re using [Maxine] like she’s a guinea pig in an experiment … Is BC Children’s Hospital going to be there in five years when she rejects [her male identity]? No they’re not. They don’t care. They want numbers.” Additionally, the judge said he gave testimony of pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Quentin Van Meter and psychiatrist Dr. Miriam Grossman – both who apparently warned of the dangers of transgender hormone treatments – “little weight” because of a risk of Maxine “attempting suicide.” LGBT activist groups continue to claim children and teens who say they want to transition to the opposite sex and are not supported by parents in that endeavor are more likely to make threats of suicide. “These activists are taking over,” Maxine’s father said, “and it’s not in the interests of our kids. It’s in the interests of self-promotion and the things that they want to do and accomplish.” According to a report at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 35 percent of teens now claiming to be transgender have attempted suicide. Dr. Michelle Cretella, executive director of the American College of Pediatricians, explained to The Federalist that transgender activists are currently engaged in the “second wave” of their strategy, which is to report parents who “refuse to affirm their child’s false gender” to Child Protective Services. Cretella said parents contacted her about having sought treatment for their 14-year-old son’s suicidal thoughts. Though the boy had no sign of gender confusion in the past, the emergency room physician diagnosed the boy as clearly transgender because he claims he is and that he is suicidal because his parents do not accept his identity. The emergency room physician then recommended the boy be started on puberty blockers and estrogen. As a result of the doctor’s prescription, the children’s hospital labeled the parents “abusive and unsupportive.” In 2018, Ohio parents of a 17-year-old girl lost custody of their daughter for opposing her wish for transgender hormone treatments. The parents reportedly continued to call their daughter by her given name, rather than a male name and refused to consent to hormone treatments that her medical team recommended. The girl claimed she became suicidal as a result of her parents’ refusal to accept that she wanted to transition to a male. Nevertheless, in October, Van Meter told Beitbart News that children who claim to be transgender are experiencing other significant traumas in their environments. “There’s nothing normal about the environment where these children are brought up,” he said. “There are emotional traumas left and right. It is so obvious that what we’re doing is painting over the trauma.” Van Meter said transgender activists want to keep buried the serious mental health issues within their community. “This is the recruitment of a cult,” Van Meter said. “It is so scary, and I am so overwhelmingly worried about the welfare of this population of people 30 years out.” EducationHealthPoliticsBritish ColumbiaDr. Michelle CretellaDr. Quentin Van Meterforced gender ideologyLGBT agendaparental rightssuicide attemptsTransgender .

        "articles": "A town in New Jersey has taken it upon itself to reach out to local illegal immigrants to instruct them on how to avoid being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials with a new pamphlet containing tips on how to skirt deportation. Princeton, New Jersey, is handing out the pamphlets and posting the information online in order to prevent what town fathers say are “really unfortunate” arrests of illegal immigrants. The pamphlets warn illegal immigrants to “have a plan” when confronted by ICE agents and advises them to “remain silent” in the face of questioning. But the City Council’s actions in favor of illegal immigrants, though, comes only about a year after a cold case sexual assault was solved and connected to an illegal immigrant who was then apprehended and found guilty. After the 2005 case of the rape of a Princeton woman sat in limbo for close to a decade, police arrested Humberto Gonzalez, 26, for the woman’s assault. By May of 2014, he was found guilty for the attack. Councilwoman Heather Howard told NJ.com the city’s goal was to protect the families of immigrants, as ICE seeks to deport those members here illegally. Recent ICE raids in the area brought condemnation from Howard. “These [arrests] are really unfortunate,” she told the paper. “They cause fear and panic in the community, and they work to undermine the community’s effort to improve law enforcement relations.” But ICE spokesman Alvin Phillips bristled at the characterization of his work, telling Fox News that ICE raids are not “unfortunate.” “ICE arrests are not unfortunate,” Philips said. “In fact to the contrary of previous reports — ICE actions are in keeping with the laws and homeland security priorities: National Security, Public Safety and Border Security. I will also add, arrests in question are afforded an opportunity to meet with legal counsel.” Recent raids in the area brought condemnation The information on how to thwart American immigration laws also appear on the city’s website under titles such as, “Know Your Rights 2016” and “Protect You and Your Family During Immigration Raids.” They are published both in English and Spanish. One pamphlet informs illegal immigrants to leave foreign IDs and passports home so U.S. authorities won’t be able to identify them if stopped. Illegal immigrant are also informed to apply for a Mercer County ID card to thwart ICE officials. The illegal immigrants are also told to contact the Mercer County Human Services office so officials can advise them on how to get out of being arrested. The city had already launched an ID service for illegal immigrants to help paper over their immigration status. Back in 2011, Princeton Borough and Princeton Township became the latest municipalities to issue local illegal immigrants official government ID cards. And as evidence of how closely the municipalities were working with advocates for illegal immigrants, the cards were being issued by an advocacy group called the Latin American Legal Defense and Education Fund. It was estimated the Princeton area has at least 1,000 immigrants from south of the border and many are here illegally. A recent report by the Princeton police stated that the area is 8 percent Hispanic. A “right to remain silent card” is also posted on the website advising illegal aliens to refuse to say anything at all to ICE agents. The cards also contain a message to officials the migrant is supposed to hand ICE agents. The card reads: “TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: Please be informed that I am choosing to exercise my right to remain silent and the right to refuse to answer your questions. If I am detained, I request to contact an attorney immediately. I am also exercising my right to refuse to sign anything until I consult with my attorney.” The town had already announced itself as a “sanctuary city.” Last year, Mayor Liz Lempert said that illegal immigrants are “good people.” In addition, last September, the city council wadded into the state-wide discussion of issuing drivers licenses to illegal aliens, urging the state to approve the idea.

        "articles": "TV foodie Anthony Bourdain told paparazzi outside an airport that if he was asked to cater a dinner for President Donald Trump, he would poison the food. The former Food Network personality and current host of CNN’s Parts Unknown was caught outside LAX airport by a photographer for celebrity gossip website TMZ. Bourdain was asked whether or not he would go to North Korea to do a food show. Bourdain said that everyone in North Korea is starving, so there is no reason to go there. He also called the diminutive dictator of the oppressed nation a series of obscene names, saying Kim Jong-un is a “chubby, evil little f***.” But then the TMZ stringer asked what Bourdain would serve if he was asked to cater a dinner for President Trump. Bourdain answered simply, “Hemlock,” appearing to admit he would poison the president if given the chance. The TMZ reporter also asked about what the TV chef thinks of the president’s tweets, but all Bourdain gave was a shrug of his shoulders. This isn’t the first time the TV food personality spoke about dining with the president. Last year, Bourdain said he would “absolutely f*cking not” dine with Trump. Also in 2016, Bourdain insisted that he would boycott the restaurant in Trump’s Washington D.C. hotel. “I will never eat in his restaurant,” Bourdain said right after Trump won the White House. “I have utter contempt for him, utter and complete contempt.” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

        "articles": "An Iraqi migrant has admitted to raping a ten year old boy in a Viennese swimming pool so ferociously that the boy had to be hospitalised for his injuries. The man said he knew it was wrong but couldn’t help himself as he hadn’t had sex in months. Police investigators have ascertained that the 20 year old man entered Austria on the 13th September, travelling into the country via the Balkans. On the December 2nd he brutally attacked the young boy, pulling him into a changing cubicle, pulling down his swimming trunks and assaulting him. Although the boy cried out he was not heard by anyone, Kronen Zeitung has reported. Following the attack, the Iraqi amused himself by diving repeatedly from the three metre board. The young boy, meanwhile, went to a lifeguard in tears and told him what had happened. The police were immediately called and were able to arrest the Iraqi on the spot, while the boy was taken to hospital suffering from serious injuries. During his interrogation the man attempted to excuse himself, saying that it had been a “sexual emergency.” He explained that he had to satisfy himself with the lad as he had not had sex in four months, explaining “I couldn’t stand not having sex as I have excess sexual energy.” He added that it had been “a huge mistake” and that he had known it would “scar the boy”. When asked whether it was illegal to have sex with ten year old boys in Iraq, the man said “Such a thing is forbidden in any country in the world.” London / EuropeChild RapeEurope Migrant CrisisIraqiMigrants .

        "articles": "President Barack Obama’s controversial comments equating the recent atrocities by the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists with those of medieval Christians sparked an uproar among the nation’s Christians. But according to ABC News, historians are also taking aim at Obama’s statement: “During the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.” University of St. Louis Historian Thomas Madden says Obama’s comments reveal an ignorance of history. “I don’t think the president knows very much about the Crusades,” Madden told ABC News. “He seems to be casting them as an example of the distortion of Christianity and trying to compare that to what he sees as a distortion of Islam in the actions of ISIS. “The initial goal of the Crusades was to give back lands to Christians that had been conquered, due to Muslim conquests,” Madden added. ABC News reports that while no reliable estimate of deaths during the Crusades exists, “the massacre of over 2,700 Muslim prisoners by Richard the Lionheart” is well-documented. University of London Historian Thomas Asbridge also told ABC News that the suggestion of any causal link between the Islamic State terrorists and the medieval Crusades is “grounded in the manipulation and misrepresentation of historical evidence.” FaithIsrael / Middle EastPoliticsBarack ObamaNational Prayer Breakfast .

        "articles": "A moderator of /r/Europe, Reddit’s largest forum for Europeans, is horrified that its users are discussing the issue of the moment — refugees and immigration. Reddit works on the basis of popularity. Users submit links or topics for discussion in topic-specific “subreddits”, and posts rise or fall on the subreddit’s front page based on how many votes they receive from other users. Users of the Europe subreddit, to the horror of their moderators, are now voting for more discussion of immigration. At the time of writing, 9 of the top 10 most popular posts on /r/Europe are about the refugee crisis. In a post on the left-leaning “circlebroke” subreddit, a moderator called NorrisOBE asked for help containing what he called “immispam” on the subreddit. In other words, redditors daring to discuss immigration and expressing opinions that the site’s left-leaning authoritarian moderators would rather stay quiet on. NorrisOBE wrote of his despair at his moderation team’s inability to control the interests of their users. “This is getting problematic,” said the mod. “I really don’t want to give up on /r/europe.” So much problematic discussion! It’s only a matter of time before the moderators resort to smelling salts and therapy. In his hand-wringing post, NorrisOBE expresses particular concern that “xenophobes” and (the horror!) “right-wingers” may be gaining popularity on the Europe subreddit. Perhaps what he meant to say is that sceptics of mass immigration are gaining popularity. In a post about Hungary’s erection of a barbed-wire fence along its borders, most of the popular comments from /r/Europe were approving. The top comment reads: “Damn, these Hungarians are fast.” Another says: “Hungary teaching us how to protect borders, applause.” Another popular post on the subreddit is a link to statistics claiming that only 1 in 5 migrants entering Europe are from Syria. All of this has horrified the lone moderator, who has now begged left-leaning members of Reddit to advise him on how to censor and control discussion. “We’ve done everything from Mass Auto Tagging /r/european users to banning day-old accounts,” he complained. “Still does not solve the problem.” Commenters suggested a number of solutions, including granting control of the subreddit to “SRS”, a notorious community of radical social justice warriors on Reddit. Others suggested banning any account less than a month old. One wily commenter did not miss the comic irony of NorrisOBE’s panicked attempt to control the influx of new users to his subreddit. “This is what happens with unchecked and unlimited immigration,” he said.

        "articles": "Despite the best efforts of the media to report the details of Hillary Clinton’s ongoing email scandal but not let it disqualify her (like they would do to a Republican), the former First Lady’s poll numbers continue to implode. A new Quinnipiac poll shows her support cratering in the crucial swing states of Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The big news is that while Trump doesn’t do as well as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio against Clinton, he is most certainly a player; just a few points behind. The argument that the billionaire businessman can’t win a general election is now a non-starter. This is also backed up by two national polls that show Trump within striking distance of Clinton. Trump’s favorability ratings and his numbers on the issues of honest and trustworthy are awful when compared to Bush and Rubio. What’s striking is that Clinton’s are just as bad. More terrible news for Clinton is that in these three vital states, Vice President Joe Biden is a stronger candidate against the GOP. On top of that, in the Democrat primary, Clinton is below 50% support in all three states. This means a majority of Democrats want someone else as their standard-bearer. Rubio beats Hillary in all three states. Bush beats Hillary in Florida and Pennsylvania. Trump beats Hillary in Florida. Florida Jeb beats Hillary 49% to 38% Rubio beats Hillary 51% to 39% Trump beats Hillary 43% to 41% Jeb beats Biden 51% to 38% Rubio beats Biden 48% to 42% Biden beats Trump 42% to 45% Hillary’s favorability rating is upside down 37% – 55%. By a breathtaking margin of 53% – 39%, voters say she is not honest and trustworthy. Bush’s favorability sits at a healthy 53% – 39% and by a margin of 64% to 28% voters see him as honest and trustworthy. On those same numbers Rubio sits at a positive 52% – 35% and 58% – 30%, respectively. Trump is upside down on both questions; 36% – 50% and 53% – 39%, respectively. Primary At 21%, Trump is in first place. Bush is in second at 17%; Rubio and Carson are tied at 11%. This is rather extraordinary when you realize Jeb and Rubio are both Floridians. Clinton murders all of her Democrat competition but she is below 50% with just 48% support. Sanders and Biden earn 15% and 11%, respectively. Ohio Hillary beats Jeb 41% to 39% Rubio beats Hillary 42% to 40% Hillary beats Trump 43% to 38% Biden beats Bush 42% – 39% Biden beats Rubio 42% – 41% Biden beats Trump 48% – 38% Hillary’s favorability rating is an awful 36% – 54%. On the issue of honesty she is upside down 60% – 34%. Jeb’s favorability is upside down 39% – 43%, but he is at a healthy 54% – 35% on the issue of honesty. Rubio is rightside up on both issues; 40% – 21% and 45% to 24%, respectively. Trump’s numbers are in the negative on both issues; 32% – 54% and 43%- 37%, respectively. Primary Ohio governor John Kasich sits in the lead at 27%. Trump is in a close second place with 21%. Everyone else is in single digits. Rubio 7%, Carson 6%, Bush 5%. Clinton is again below 50% with just 47% support. Sanders and Biden earn respective support of 17% and 14%. Pennsylvania Bush beats Hillary 43% – 40% Rubio beats Hillary 47% – 40% Hillary beats Trump 45% – 40% Bush beats Biden 43% to 42% Rubio beats Biden 44% to 41% Biden beats Trump 48% to 40% The favorability and honesty numbers for all four candidates almost perfectly mirrors Ohio and Florida. Primary Trump smashes the competition with 24% support. Carson, Rubio, and Bush trail with 13%, 10%, and 6%, respectively. Hillary earns the support of 45% of Democrats; Sanders 19%, Biden 17%.

Of CNN’s millions of followers on their verified Twitter account, over 17 million or 48 percent are fake, according to TwitterAudit. According to TwitterAudit, the site determines the quality and score of real and fake followers by taking “a sample of up to 5000 (or more, if you subscribe to Pro) Twitter followers for a user and calculates a score for each follower. This score is based on number of tweets, date of the last tweet, and ratio of followers to friends.” TwitterAudit states that these results are not definitive but do provide insight into whether or not a Twitter account gained followers through illegitimate means: “We use these scores to determine whether any given user is real or fake. Of course, this scoring method is not perfect but it is a good way to tell if someone with lots of followers is likely to have increased their follower count by inorganic, fraudulent, or dishonest means.” In comparison,  New’s verified Twitter account has a TwitterAudit rating of 96 percent.

        "articles": "At least two masked gunmen have attacked the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, with reports that 11 people have been killed. The attackers are believed to have successfully fled the scene and headed to the east of Paris, swapping vehicles on the way. Witnesses reported sustained gunfire as the attackers opened with Kalashnikov assault rifles. The magazine has caused controversy in the past with its depiction of Muslims. A firebomb attack gutted the headquarters in 2011 after the magazine featured the Prophet Muhammed on the frontpage claiming he was the guest editor. France Info Radio (FIR) also said police had confirmed a toll of 12 dead and five critically injured. The death toll is believed to include two Police Officers, who arrived on bikes. FIR quoted a witness as saying he saw the incident from a building nearby in the heart of the French capital. “About a half an hour ago two black-hooded men entered the building with Kalashnikovs (guns),” Benoit Bringer told the station. “A few minutes later we heard lots of shots,” he said, adding that the men were then seen fleeing the building. A police official, Luc Poignant, described the scene as “carnage”. In 2012 the magazine published a ‘naked’ photo of Muhammed, they have also used the magazine to mock a variety. One frontcover questions whether anyone in Europe wants Britain to be a member of the European Union. The magazine was originally called Hara-Kiri Hebdo but was banned when it published a frontcover about the death of Charles de Gaulle in 1970. It was relaunched the following week under the new name Charlie Hebdo in reference to the former President. It has been claimed the gunmen were asking for people by name before shooting them. A number of France’s most famous cartoonists have been reported as having been killed. The attack took place at the weekly planning meeting, so all the most senior staff were present. The gunmen are still at large, leading France to raise it’s terror threat assessment to it’s highest level. The French cabinet will hold an emergency meeting at 2pm local time. President Hollande visited the scene and said the series of terrorist attacks against France had taken place because they “are a country of freedom”. He added: “No one should think they can go against the spirit of France” and pledged a “firm response”. The President said police had thwarted a number of terrorist attacks in recent weeks, he also said the actions of the Police had saved forty lives. He is believed to have been referring to the intervention by the two police officers who arrived on bikes and were killed. A video has emerged of the attack, it shows the attackers using the standard infantry ‘double tap’ method with their AK47’s. Their control of the weapons suggests they were well trained.

        "articles": "Online feminists and social justice warriors (SJWs) have been fooled by users of an internet forum into starting a campaign to ban the Christmas tradition of kissing under mistletoe. Apparently, the small plant promotes nonconsensual kissing and even rape. “I have an idea for trolling feminists”, wrote an anonymous user on the internet forum 4Chan on 1 December. “Let’s see if we can get them to ban mistletoe because it ‘promotes rape culture’”. “Something like #SayNoToMistletoe. What do you think?” he propositioned. “Could actually work” responded one user. “Bumping for serious potential”, added another. ‘Rape culture’ is the idea that Western culture somehow promotes and perpetuates the crime of rape, and that pernicious forces in society like the patriarchy are responsible for the violent crimes. Mistletoe is a parasitic plant with tiny white berries. Small sprigs are traditionally hung up at random locations during Christmas time, under which lovers are expected to kiss. Because the tradition encourages men to kiss women, it could be said to perpetuate rape according to ‘rape culture’ logic. Almost immediately after the suggestion was made on 4Chan, a fake twitter page was set up and users of the messaging board began covertly spreading the message, posting satirical but genuine-sounding messages condemning mistletoe. Mistletoe is so wrong. Men are pigs and use this construct as a means for rape. Another wrong in our patriarchal society. #SayNoToMistletoe — TitsMcgee (@HuntaroTheGreat) December 4, 2015 #SayNoToMistletoe let's abolish this horrific tradition that promotes rape culture — Colin Diehl (@C_DiehlQB8) December 4, 2015  Some feminists fell for it.   #SayNoToMistletoe because up to 85% of all adults in US are carriers of oral herpes… and that stuff never goes away people.

Campus authorities issued a document demanding that students and staff avoid the tradition, because it “doesn’t create an inclusive environment”. The trolling campaign is similar to other successful hoaxes on social justice warriors (SJWs) and feminists, such as the ‘p*ss for equality’ campaign, where feminist were tricked into wetting themselves in ‘solidarity’ with rape victims, and the ‘free bleeding’ prank, when 4Chan users managed to fool most of the mainstream press.

        "articles": "Target’s unpopular decision to force its customer base of mothers and children into mixed-sex bathrooms and changing rooms is creating an economic opportunity for other firms — but none have announced plans to exploit the company’s pro-transgender mistake. “Target could lose millions of customers if other retail chains take advantage of the boycott,” says Chris Stone, a former brand-manager who now runs Faith Based Consumer, which grades companies on their respect for Christian consumers. Indeed, Walmart just reported an unexpected uptick and experienced a rise in stock prices. “If ten million people switched from Target to another company just once, they could cost the company $600 million in revenues, assuming an average purchase of $60,” he said. “That lost revenue will have an even greater impact on company profits and stock prices.” “If Walmart comes out and proactively states they welcome these disenfranchised consumers [and] they’ll provide proof of performance, there will be a migration of consumers from Target to Walmart,” Stone told . In fact, any company which “reaches out to that consumer, and says ‘You’re welcome here,” can benefit, Stone said. Target’s managers, he added, “have taken a position that is so polarizing, it will be very easy for the consumer to pick and choose among the competitors who they like better.” Though it is hard to know if Target’s loss was Walmart’s gain, late last week the nation’s largest retailer reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. The announcement drove up stock prices even its competitors have been on the downturn. “It looks like the middle-to-higher-income customers have cut back, but the lower-income customer is spending,” analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters last Thursday. Walmart stock shares were up 9.3 percent at $69.05 on Thursday morning’s trading. Only a few small or upmarket chains have quietly announced their own transgender-friendly bathroom policies, including Barnes & Noble booksellers, Hudson’s Bay Co. department stores (owner of Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue), and the liberal Starbucks coffee company. Starbucks spokeswoman Jaime Riley said the coffee chain is “looking into additional opportunities to have more gender-neutral signage in our restrooms where jurisdictions allow it,” USA Today reported. But Starbucks doesn’t have dressing rooms in their small coffee-to-go outlets. But USA Today was unable to find any other retailer willing to confirm a policy for or against mixed-sex bathrooms.  asked retailers such as Walmart, Sears, and K-Mart if they had any specific transgender bathroom policies. None replied to the queries left with their public relations departments. Of course, many corporations have LGBT polices, such as those Target celebrates. Hormel foods, a meat processor, has celebrated itself for its LGBT policies, crowning itself the “best place to work for LGBT equality.” Fitness gym operator Planet Fitness has also in the past announced its own LGBT-friendly policies by insisting that men can use the women’s locker rooms. The company has already acted on its policy, as well. As The Federalist notes, in 2015 the fitness giant actually revoked the membership of a woman who complained about a man who insisted on using the women’s locker room. But, with so few others standing up with Target, it appears that most American retailers are hoping the whole discussion just fades away so that they don’t have to take a public stance. Target Corp’s stock price has fallen from $83.98 on the day the new policy was announced, to $75.70 on May 12. That’s a loss of roughly $4.5 billion in stock value. Target’s CEO Brian Cornell is trying to reduce the damage. On May 11, for example, he promised that every store would have a family restroom. We’re committed over the next few months, to make sure every one of our stores has that option, because we want to make sure that our guests be welcomed in our stores. But if there’s a question of safety, I can tell you and others, our focus on safety is unwavering, and we want to make sure we provide a welcoming environment for all our guests, one that’s safe, one that’s comfortable. But he declined to reverse his decision to impose mixed-sex changing rooms on middle-class families, and he continued to reassure progressives and Wall Street experts that Target’s pro-transgender open-door policy is a good idea. Target has done itself a lot of harm in the highly competitive retail sector, Stone insisted. More than one million people have signed the American Family Association petition against the mixed-sex bathroom and changing-room policy — and another 10 million Americans may know about and disagree with the company policy. “What is really going to be important is to see if [another retail] brand comes out and openly welcomes all these disenchanted Target customers. Someone is going to have to say ‘We welcome you. If you’re not happy at Target, come over and because we welcome you here,’” Stone averred. “If someone does that, they will be able to secure those customers” the activist added. Companies need to do what they can to bolster their revenues, Stone concluded, because the retail sector is already very competitive and is losing customers to the online shopping. For example, the Sports Authority chain is failing. Just in California, Walmart, Macy’s, Sears, Kmart, JCPenney, and The Gap are closing stories in 2016, according to a retail industry website.

        "articles": "Netflix has reportedly seen a surge in U.S. subscription cancellations following the controversy over the movie Cuties, which has generated a firestorm over its highly sexualized depiction of underage girls. Variety cited a study from a data firm called YipItData that found that on Saturday, Netflix’s cancellation rate in the U.S. jumped to nearly eight times higher than the average daily levels recorded in August. The firm noted that Netflix subscriber churn rates — or cancellations — began to rise on Thursday, which is when the hashtag #CancelNetflix reached the top-trending spot on Twitter. Netflix doesn’t release subscriber cancellation data and so the YipItData study is based on estimates and other secondary methods of divining Netflix’s internal figures. YipItData didn’t provide estimates on the actual number of customers who have canceled, according to Variety. Netflix reported that it had 193 million paying subscribers worldwide at the end of the second quarter in June. Cuties continues to be a lightening rod for Netflix as the controversy draws scrutiny from a growing number of politicians. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) is among the Republican lawmakers calling on the U.S. Department of Justice to open a criminal investigation into Netflix for what Cotton called “peddling child pornography.” Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) has condemned Cuties as “child porn,” saying that Netflix is “complicit” in encouraging pedophiles and helping to fuel the child sex trafficking trade. Netflix is standing by its decision to release the French movie, arguing that the film is actually a “social commentary” against the sexualization of children. Not buying it, Sen. Cotton tweeted Tuesday that protecting children should take precedence over “art.” “We all have a duty to protect the children under our care,” the senator tweeted. “When adults fail in that duty, young lives are harmed, predators are emboldened, and society itself is coarsened as a consequence. No ‘art’ or ‘social commentary’ can justify such a moral outrage.” We all have a duty to protect the children under our care. When adults fail in that duty, young lives are harmed, predators are emboldened, and society itself is coarsened as a consequence. No “art” or “social commentary” can justify such a moral  — Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) September 15, 2020 Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has appeared on CNN twice in less than a week.

        "articles": "Mark Kelly’s campaign against “assault weapons” such as the AR-15 rifle has sparked a local backlash. On March 13, a Tucson, Arizona radio host published a photograph of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords holding an AR-15 rifle at a gun range. Giffords has since confirmed that the photograph is authentic. James T. Harris, blogging at the website of “101.4 FM The Truth,” wrote: What is wrong with this picture? Absolutely nothing, and prior to the aggressive progressive opportunistic fear mongering in the wake of Sandy Hook, this picture would have raised no eyebrows and garnered little public attention. However, in response to the exploitative political scheming of Mark Kelly, persons connected to Congresswoman Giffords released this photo in response to what they perceived to be her husband’s hypocrisy. Subsequently,  News confirmed the authenticity of the image through law enforcement sources in Arizona, and obtained a copy of the photograph from a source who requested anonymity. The latter source was present when the photograph was taken, and said that Giffords had requested it for campaign purposes during October 2010. According to the source, the image sent to  News was cropped to protect the identity of the person on the right-hand side of the original photograph (to Giffords’s left). The source, who is a member of the law enforcement community, told  News: “We were told she wanted to toughen her image. She asked to come out and she wanted to shoot a rifle. She had one of our guys out there to show her how to shoot an AR-15.” In January 2011, Giffords suffered near-fatal wounds in a mass shooting while meeting with constituents in Tucson. The perpetrator used a 9mm Glock 19 semi-automatic pistol. Giffords and husband Mark Kelly have since formed an organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions, to press for policy changes such as limiting the sale of “assault weapons, ” including the AR-15.  News reported last week that Kelly attempted to purchase an AR-15 from a gun store in Tucson earlier this month. Likewise, the AR-15 that Giffords is shown holding in the image is a standard, semi-automatic civilian weapon, according to the source who saw it being taken. The source saw a campaign official take the photograph, which was later provided to law enforcement personnel as a courtesy, according to the source. The source says the existence of the photograph has been known in the local law enforcement community for a while: “I’m not the only one who knows about this photo.” Multiple law enforcement sources in Arizona told  News that Mark Kelly’s campaign against “assault weapons” has generated resentment within the law enforcement community–and a desire that the photograph be made public. The source who witnessed the photograph put it this way: “Giffords and Kelly came across with a different demeanor in 2010. To me, it seems like they’ve done a complete 180 because of what happened. And with the latest controversy–with Mark Kelly doing what he did with the AR-15 stunt–this photo needs to be put out.” While Kelly declined to comment, Americans for Responsible Solutions spokesperson Jen Bluestein told  News: “Looks like the photo is cropped.” Bluestein noted that there are “many images of Gabrielle Giffords with guns,” though she said she had not seen the image of the AR-15 before. At 1:14 p.m. PDT, Giffords posted two images on her Facebook page with the following statement: Here are two photos of me that a conservative blog has dug up. I remember both of these days fondly. The first is at the Tucson Police Department firing range. They invited me to test rifles and tasers that they bought with federal funds, which I helped secure. The second was in Afghanistan while I was visiting with our troops serving abroad. My work as Southern Arizona’s Congresswoman frequently put me in close contact with some of the world’s most powerful and deadly weapons – supporting police departments, advocating for the Border Patrol, standing up for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and supporting my constituents’ and my own Second Amendment rights. I grew up with guns, and I like owning them. So does my husband Mark. It’s an interest we’ve shared ever since we met. It’s part of my heritage as an Arizonan and it’s my right as an American. Being able to shoot a gun is something I haven’t been able to do since I was shot – because my right arm is paralyzed, and I’m less mobile than I was. As I member of the House Armed Services Committee, I proudly spent a lot of time with our military, border patrol and state and local law enforcement. I guess the intention of those who have publicized these photos is to somehow call into question my belief that military style assault weapons should be more strongly regulated with background checks and other safeguards. I have never wavered in my support for those who serve our country. I fought to make sure they have the weapons and safety gear needed to carry out their mission, and proper health and mental care when their service ends. Both sides of the gun violence debate usually miss the point. We don’t have to choose between owning, using, and enjoying guns, on one hand, and preventing gun violence, on the other. Both sides need to come together to support commonsense solutions to gun violence, like keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people like the young man who shot me. That’s why I’m fighting this fight. That’s why I’m working to bring people together to support gun rights and reduce gun violence. I hope you join me. Josiah Cantrall and Joel B.

        "articles": "Shannon, arguably the most conservative House Speaker in Oklahoma’s history, has been surging in the polls, propelled in part by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s endorsement. Shannon trailed Rep. James Lankford (R-OK) by 35 points but has closed the gap to single digits in a poll taken four days after Palin’s endorsement. “I’ve taken a very close look at this race and have talked to a number of folks who know Shannon,” Levin wrote on his Facebook page. “I want to join great conservatives, like my friend Sarah Palin, in endorsing Shannon for Senate in Oklahoma. Shannon is very impressive and, I believe, understands the dire situation facing the nation.” Levin and Palin have been leading the charge for conservatives against the ossifying Republican establishment, and Levin’s endorsement is likely to earn Shannon even more of the trust of Republican primary voters in the nation’s reddest state. On  News Saturday, Shannon, who previously said Palin’s endorsement brings more than money can buy, said that Palin’s endorsement gave his campaign a “huge boost in the arm” because Oklahomans trust that Palin, who has a 78% favorability rating in Oklahoma, will back candidates who will go to Washington and fight against the permanent political class. Levin emphasized that Shannon, who has said he wants to go to Washington not to be a manager who manages America’s decline but to fight to turn the country around, gets the dire situation the country is facing. Levin, along with Palin, has been one of the most instrumental figures of the conservative grassroots. His book Liberty and Tyranny predicted much of President Barack Obama’s statist agenda before it was implemented and sold over a million copies even though the mainstream media ignored it, showing the power of the conservative movement and its ability to circumvent the mainstream press.

        "articles": "Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) nuked Democrat witnesses during the House Judiciary Committee’s first impeachment inquiry hearing on Wednesday in a fiery round of questioning that exposed their bias against President Trump and Republicans. Gaetz also got the witnesses, all constitutional law professors, to admit they donated thousands of dollars to Democrats. Gaetz first asked Michael Gerhardt, professor at University of North Carolina, if he donated money to Barack Obama. Gerhardt responded, “My family did, yes.” Gaetz asked, “Four times?” Gerhardt responded, “That sounds about right, yes.” Gaetz then pointed out that witness Noah Feldman, professor at Harvard Law School, had written articles entitled: “Trump’s Wiretap Tweets Raise Risk of Impeachment” and “Mar-a-Lago Ad Belongs in Impeachment File.” Gaetz also noted that Feldman was the subject of an article that said, “A Harvard law professor thinks Trump could be impeached over fake news accusations.” Gaetz also got Feldman to admit that he once wrote an article entitled, “It’s Hard to Take Impeachment Seriously Now.” He then asked Pamela Karlan, professor at Stanford Law School, if she gave $1,000 to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). “I believe so,” Karlan responded. “You gave $1,200 to Barack Obama?” Gaetz asked. “I have no reason to question that,” Karlan said. “You gave $2,000 bucks to Hillary Clinton?” Gaetz asked. “That’s correct,” Karlan responded. Asked why she gave much more for Clinton than the other two, Karlan quipped, “I’ve been giving more to charity recently because of all of the poor people in the United States.” Gaetz retorted, “Well that’s not the only folks you’ve been giving to.” He also asked if she had ever been on a podcast called “Versus Trump.” She acknowledged she appeared on a live panel hosted by the hosts of such a podcast. She also admitted that she said on that panel, “Liberals tend to cluster more. Conservatives, especially very conservative people, tend to spread out more, perhaps because they don’t even want to be around themselves.” Gaetz blasted her remark: “Do you understand how that reflects contempt on people who are conservative?” He continued, “You may not see this from you know, like the ivory towers of your law school but it makes actual people in this country — ” When Karlan tried to cut him off, saying, “When the president calls — ,” Gaetz immediately shut her down. “Excuse me, you don’t get to interrupt me on this time.” He then blasted the joke earlier in the hearing, where she invoked the president’s teenage son, Barron. “Let me also suggest that when you invoke the president’s son’s name here, when you try to make a little joke out of referencing Barron Trump that does not lend credibility to your argument, it makes you look mean,” he said. “It makes you look like you’re attacking someone’s family — the minor child of the president of the United States.” He then closed by asking witnesses if they could raise their hand if any of them had “personal knowledge of a single material fact in the Schiff report.” His question was met with blank stares and silence. Gaetz continued: And let the record reflect, no personal knowledge of a single fact and you know what, that continues on the tradition that we saw from Adam Schiff. Where Ambassador [Bill] Taylor could not identify an impeachable offense. Mr. [George] Kent never met with the president. Fiona Hill never heard the president reference anything regarding military aid. Mr. [David] Hale was unaware of any nefarious with aid. Col. [Alex] Vindman even rejected the Democrat talking point that bribery was invoked here. Ambassador [Kurt] Volker denied that there was a quid pro quo and Mr. Morrison said there was nothing wrong on the call. The only direct evidence came from Gordon Sondland who spoke to the president of the United States and the president said “I want nothing. No quid pro quo.” And you know, if wiretapping is an impeachment offense, I look forward to the inspector general’s report because maybe it’s a different president we should be impeaching.

        "articles": "Three men have been arrested for the attempted firebombing of a Swedish synagogue in Gothenburg, and according to a far-left group all three are recent asylum seekers from Syria and Palestine. The men, aged 18, 20, and 21, were arrested by police following the attack, which saw a group of around 20 masked individuals attack a Gothenburg synagogue with firebombs in an effort to burn the building down. The three men arrested in connection with the attack are said to be asylum seekers who came to Sweden this year from the Middle East, according to George Soros-funded far-left group Expo. Expo, who are known for their activism against right-wing groups in Sweden, claim they spoke to President of the Swedish Western Regional Police Ulla Brehm, who confirmed the arrests. They also say that they obtained court documents which showed that all three suspects are asylum seekers and that the trio pled not guilty to charges of deliberate arson. Sweden: Masked Gang Firebomb Synagogue After Jerusalem Protest  —  London (@London) December 10, 2017 The attack occurred around the same time as a demonstration in the heavily migrant-populated city of Malmö, where a group of around 200 demonstrators protested the decision of U.S. President Donald Trump to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Participants at the event chanted anti-Semitic rhetoric, declaring: “We have announced the intifada from Malmö. We want our freedom back, and we will shoot the Jews.” Expo also claims to have evidence that one of the men arrested by police in connection with the synagogue firebombing had expressed his opposition to the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, but they did not note any evidence he had connections to radical Islamic extremists. After the announcement President Trump’s decision, protests emerged in both the Middle East and European countries with large Muslim populations like the UK, where model Bella Hadid joined a “Free Palestine” protest in London. Trump was also met with opposition from the leaders of traditional allies like Prime Minister Theresa May, who said: “The status of Jerusalem should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Jerusalem should ultimately form a shared capital between the Israeli and Palestinian states.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau echoed Mrs May, saying: “We will not be moving Canada’s embassy to Jerusalem. Canada has a long-standing policy on the Mideast. We need to work towards a two-state solution through direct negotiations.” ImmigrationIsrael / Middle EastLondon / EuropeantisemitismEurope Migrant CrisisMigrantsrefugeesSwedenSyrian asylum seekers .

For those who have been following Biden’s decision closely, its getting harder to take these kinds of pronouncements seriously – particularly since his reported “deadlines” keep getting blown. “Confidants of Vice President Joe Biden expect him to make a decision next weekend, or shortly thereafter, on whether to launch an epic battle with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination,” Politico reported on Monday, October 5. But with the new 48 hour timeline, the media will assuredly be focused squarely on Biden while Hillary Clinton, the party’s frontrunner prepares to testify to the Benghazi committee. The timing is odd, but the Democratic establishment is apoplectic that the Vice President continues to tease the possibility. If she stumbles, Biden’s timing could be considered a stroke of genius. But it also threatens to take away some of the spotlight away from the hearing if she does well. Clinton has already downplayed expectations for the hearing, painting it as a partisan endeavor to lower her poll numbers. “I’ve already testified about Benghazi. I testified to the best of my ability before the Senate and the House,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview on Friday. “I don’t know that I have very much to add.” PoliticsBenghaziHillary ClintonJake TapperJoe Biden .

Psaki spoke about the crisis and the White House response to it in an interview with former President Barack Obama’s campaign manager David Axelrod. She acknowledged the border was an “important issue” that the Biden White House was “focused on” but argued more Americans were concerned with the coronavirus pandemic. “What percentage of the public is focused on the border?” she asked. “A much smaller percentage than who’s focused on the pandemic and the economy. So that may be maddening, but, you know, that’s what we try to do.” Axelrod said the effort to get the Biden administration to describe the border crisis as a crisis was “sort of a game that drives you nuts” in Washington, DC. “‘White House in crisis,'” Psaki replied, mocking cable news chyrons and headlines about the border. “Our calculation on that front is one, this is cyclical, we’ve seen surges at the border, every time it happens, it’s bad, until we do something to address it over the long term with root causes, immigration reform, it’s going to keep happening,” she continued. Psaki said she fought the nature of social media and traditional media to brand the crisis as a crisis. “Really, what we had to be focused on was like what we were going to do about it,” she said. “And to us it’s like, it’s like that wasn’t really a crisis, it’s a huge challenge.” ImmigrationPoliticsBarack ObamaDavid AxelrodJen PsakiJoe BidenSouthern BorderWhite House .

        "articles": "The day after declaring Obamacare magically rewritten and that the lawsuits against discrimination in housing require no proof of actual discrimination, the Supreme Court found a unicorn in the 14th Amendment. By a vote of 5-4, the Supreme Court ruled that the right to privacy under that aforementioned 14th Amendment (adopted in 1868, when every state in America criminalized sodomy) requires that every state in America grant marriage licenses to men who want to marry men and women who want to marry women, and that every state recognize such licenses from every other state. By this point, nobody should be surprised that the Supreme Court sees new rights in its Cheerios. As our Supreme Rulers, the Supreme Court can declare what they want to declare, since rule of law died long ago at the hands of leftist deconstruction of language. But this decision is particularly galling to those who believe words have meaning and that government is not God. The Court rejects both of those claims. Words have no meaning; they are merely tools to be used in implementation of the utopian agenda of the far-left. Government is God, a dignity-conferring institution capable of making moral that which religion teaches is sinful, logic teaches is worthless, and societal experience teaches is societally counterproductive. Naturally, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has made it his lifelong work to read same-sex rights into the Constitution (this, after all is the man who once wrote, based wholly on the authority of the voices in his head, that the Constitution mandates “respect” for sodomy), delivered the majority opinion. Kennedy opens by essentially paraphrasing himself in the pro-abortion case Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1989), in which he established one of his many preferred fantasy rights: “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.” This time, he simply says that people have a right to “within a lawful realm, define and express their identity.” Of course, the Court defines that “lawful realm” at its whim; otherwise Charles Manson would simply have been expressing his Constitutional rights. Same-sex marriage falls within that lawful realm, says Kennedy, although he fails to explain how the state not granting people a piece of paper equates to preventing them from expressing their identity. Presumably the states will now be required to give Rachel Dolezal a race-change certificate. Kennedy then launches into a history of marriage: From their beginning to their most recent page, the annals of human history reveal the transcendent importance of marriage. The lifelong union of a man and a woman always has promised nobility and dignity to all persons, without regard to their station in life. Marriage is sacred to those who live by their religions and offers unique fulfillment to those who find meaning in the secular realm. Its dynamic allows two people to find a life that could not be found alone, for a marriage becomes greater than just the two persons. Rising from the most basic human needs, marriage is essential to our most profound hopes and aspirations. Kennedy quotes everyone from Confucius to Cicero on the importance of marriage. Then, begrudgingly, he admits, “It is fair and necessary to say these references were based on the understanding that marriage is a union between two persons of the opposite sex.” He adds, patronizingly, that the view that such a definition is the only definition “has been held – and continues to be held – in good faith by reasonable and sincere people here and throughout the world.” But those people are wrong, because Justice Kennedy says so. Justice Kennedy and his brethren know that the importance of marriage rests on fundamentally redefining it, just as Barack Obama knows that the importance of America rests on fundamentally changing it. Marriage’s foundational nature is so important that it must be redefined into meaninglessness: The petitioners acknowledge this history but contend that these cases cannot end there. Were their intent to demean the revered idea and reality of marriage, the petitioners’ claims would be of a different order. But that is neither their purpose nor their submission. To the contrary, it is the enduring importance of marriage that underlies the petitioners’ contentions. This, they say, is their whole point. Far from seeking to devalue marriage, the petitioners seek it for themselves because of their respect—and need—for its privileges and responsibilities. And their immutable nature dictates that same-sex marriage is their only real path to this profound commitment. In other words, Kennedy and the Court now contend that the intent of those who want to change marriage is a defining feature here, and that since people are born gay, this is their only path to happiness. Presumably, if the intent of a polyandrous group were to extend dignity to themselves, that too would be acceptable, given that polyandry is widely practiced throughout humanity and in the animal kingdom as well. It is worth noting here that Kennedy’s contention that sexual orientation is “immutable nature” now places sexual orientation on the same level as race for purposes of law. We will return to this point shortly. Kennedy continues by telling the lovelorn stories of star-crossed homosexual lovers who do not have the same privileges as those who marry those of opposite sex. It’s all very moving, and it all sounds very much like Justice Kennedy looks forward to home-viewing Cate Blanchett’s Carol, and it’s all very irrelevant to legality. But Kennedy has no truck with legality. So Kennedy goes on to pretend that arranged marriages and coverture, which have been abandoned, were as integral to marriage itself as the sex of the participants. This is equivalent to arguing that changing the air freshener hanging from your rearview mirror changes the fundamental nature of your automobile the same way removing the transmission would. But no matter: the Godhead is lecturing. So he tells us about the history of gay and lesbian rights in the United States, drones on about the evils of the American Psychiatric Association, and blathers about the case law of homosexuality. All of this is chaff. The kernel comes next: The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution’s central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed. And that, as they say, is that. That is the entirety of the legal argumentation of Justice Kennedy and the majority. They know better. They have declared. End of story. Prior case law assuming marriage to be between a man and a woman – moot (the Court, says the Court, “made assumptions defined by the world and time of which it is part,” as opposed to this Court, which has been blessed with the eternal knowledge of Justice Kennedy and his leftist colleagues). The rationale for marriage – moot (marriage, Kennedy blithely declares, is not about producing, bearing, and raising children, but about other more important principles). Kennedy says that marriage rests on four bases: (1) Individual autonomy: “There is dignity in the bond between two men or two women who seek to marry and in their autonomy to make such profound choices.” Why individual autonomy requires a government-issued license is anyone’s guess; as Chief Justice Roberts writes in dissent, “petitioners do not seek privacy. Quite the opposite, they seek public recognition of their relationships, along with corresponding government benefits.” Justice Scalia, as usual, is more scathing: “Who ever thought that intimacy and spirituality [whatever that means] were freedoms? And if intimacy is, one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage. Ask the nearest hippie.” (2) Commitment: “Marriage responds to the universal fear that a lonely person might call out only to find no one there. It offers the hope of companionship and understanding and assurance that while both still live there will be someone to care for the other.” Of course, loneliness is not a legal argument. (3) Childbearing and rearing: “[I]t safeguards children and families and thus draws meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education.” This one, for obvious reasons, is problematic for the majority, so they simply elide the issue by saying gay couples must marry because gay couples have adopted children (“children suffer the stigma of knowing their families are somehow lesser”). Never mind that gay couples cannot produce children or whether children are better off with straight couples. We simply assume the conclusion, and the rest follows. And this particular aspect of marriage – the key aspect in world history – is not that important anyhow, the Court declares: “The constitutional marriage right has many aspects, of which childbearing is only one.” (4) Keystone of the social order: “Marriage remains a building block of our national community. For that reason, just as a couple vows to support each other, so does society pledge to support the couple, offering symbolic recognition and material benefits to protect and nourish the union.” This ignores why marriage is a building block: it protects children, allows them to grow up healthy and whole, and prevents the breakdown of the social order itself, which we have seen as childbearing out of wedlock has increased dramatically. But since the left doesn’t care about childbearing out of wedlock, and childbearing is just “only one” aspect of marriage, no matter: marriage is a cornerstone, though the majority undermines its reason for being one. In the end, Kennedy’s case is simply that to be against same-sex marriage is bigotry: “It demeans gays and lesbians for the State to lock them out of a central institution of the Nation’s society.” With breathtaking arrogance, Kennedy concludes: The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest. For thousands of years, everybody got it wrong. For hundreds of years, every American state got it wrong. Today, the vast majority of the planet’s population gets it wrong, and so do hundreds of millions of Americans. But their wrongness is “manifest.” Why? Because Kennedy says so. But he goes even further: he explains that rights emanate not from God or nature, but from the wise oligarchs of the government, who can reinterpret rights as they see fit: [R]ights come not from ancient sources alone. They rise, too, from a better informed understanding of how constitutional imperatives define a liberty that remains urgent in our own era. Better understanding by whom? By the government, of course. Which means that since the government is God, it can change the definition of fundamental rights and institutions at whim. Is polygamy on the table? Why, exactly, wouldn’t it be? It fulfills all four marital criteria Kennedy lays out – and who is to say that those criteria will not change over time, just as the criteria for opposite-sex partners changed? Then Kennedy drops the most dangerous line of all: Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. Under this rubric, religious Americans can kiss their own liberties goodbye. It does not matter whether religious Americans stand for traditional marriage because of their religion or because of secular concerns. They are, for all Kennedy’s pretty words to the contrary, to be considered legal bigots. If religious people must be excluded from public policy, there will be no protections for them in law anywhere. Kennedy defines same-sex marriage as a “fundamental right,” which is what allows the Court to overturn the vast majority of state laws, and further prevents states from rejecting marital benefits to everyone equally (if you have a right to a marriage certificate, you have a right to marriage certificate). That redefinition will also allow the Court to overturn the First Amendment protections of freedom of religion. Kennedy pays lip service to religious freedom: Finally, it must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned. The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered. This, to put it mildly, is bullshit. Anyone who relies on the Supreme Court to protect the rights of religious schools not to employ members of same-sex couples and operate with business licenses and state imprimaturs of accreditation; or the rights of religious institutions not to perform same-sex marriages and operate as businesses or non-profits; or the rights of parents to home school their children and teach them about the absence of value in same-sex sexual activity and marriage, without the interference of the state – all of those people are whistling past the graveyard in which the Supreme Court has dismembered and buried the Constitution in a shallow hole. Justice Kennedy just redefined a fundamental right and forced elected state governments to slap their stamp of approval on that right. He then went on to equate sexual orientation with immutable characteristics like skin color, meaning that buried in this decision is the far more important decision that private parties across the country must acknowledge and embrace same-sex marriage under the Civil Rights Act. The First Amendment will be no protection. Why wouldn’t the Court, with or without Kennedy, rip away religious freedoms on the basis of a new fundamental right? If the Court can declare a new fundamental right, why can’t it chop away at an old one we now realize must change based on a “better informed understanding of how constitutional imperatives define a liberty that remains urgent in our own era”? The majority opinion drew three dissents. The first, by the disappointing Chief Justice Roberts, is a basic legal case that even if you like same-sex marriage, there is no fundamental right to its redefinition by governments. “Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us. Under the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be,” Roberts writes, in a line that would have been far more convincing before he rewrote Obamacare in favor of how it should have been written according to him. He concludes: If you are among the many Americans—of whatever sexual orientation—who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today’s decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it. Justice Thomas agrees, explaining that the Constitution protects negative liberties, not positive grants of privileges; he further explains, rightly, that the majority’s assumption that government confers dignity through marriage is nonsense (“The government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take it away”). He then notes the threat to religious liberty: Religious liberty is about more than just the protection for “religious organizations and persons… as they seek to teach the principles that are so ful- filling and so central to their lives and faiths.” Ibid. Religious liberty is about freedom of action in matters of religion generally, and the scope of that liberty is directly correlated to the civil restraints placed upon religious practice. Not for long. Justice Scalia’s own dissent is significantly more fiery. Calling the decision a “judicial Putsch,” he writes: [I]t is not of special importance to me what the law says about marriage. It is of overwhelming importance, however, who it is that rules me. Today’s decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court. The opinion in these cases is the furthest extension in fact— and the furthest extension one can even imagine—of the Court’s claimed power to create “liberties” that the Constitution and its Amendments neglect to mention. This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected commit- tee of nine, always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves. But in the idolatry of the left, we do not have the freedom to govern ourselves, nor even to rely the old God for our values and truths. Our betters will lead us. And they will grant any right they see fit, and reject any liberty they see fit, and redefine any term they see fit. Democracy in America did not die with jackboots; it died with the boredom and stupidity of an American people complicit in its demise, celebrating the circuses and the games provided by its new rulers, fat and happy in their submission. Let the parades be held; let the call go forth. By the power vested in them by, well, them, the Supreme Court and the left declare Americans husbands and husbands, wives and wives — and all of them slaves.

        "articles": "Appearing Monday on MSNBC’s Deadline: White House, former Illinois congressman and longshot 2020 Republican presidential candidate Joe Walsh conceded that he has previously made “racist” remarks. A partial transcript is as follows: JOHN HEILEMANN: You’ve apologized for helping to spawn Trump and for going too far. For a lot of people, the president is a stone-cold racist and so are you. I can sit here and read off tweets: “Barack Obama’s a Muslim,” “Barack Obama was born in Kenya.” I’ve got tweets with you using the N-word, not that long ago. You can apologize for various things. Apologizing for burping at the table or using the wrong fork with your main course is different than offering some kind of a genuine recognition — not just “I said things that were offensive” — but “I’m a racist, I’ve said racist stuff.” There’s no way someone who — to many African-Americans, looks like as much as a racist as Donald Trump — has the moral standing to challenge Donald Trump. JOE WALSH: I wouldn’t call myself a racist, but I would say, John, I’ve said racist things on Twitter. There’s no doubt about it. And an apology is not enough. When I said Barack Obama was a Muslim, that was a horrible thing to say. And I said it because I was so disgusted with Obama’s policy towards Israel, that I went a bad, ugly step. The Sandy Hook moms, I took a cheap shot against them three years ago because they were suing gun manufacturers, an issue that I disagree with. So I took a bad, cheap shot against them. I’ve done that. But, John, again, context, I’ve probably sent out 40,000 tweets in the last six years, no excuse, you and I could sit down and find 200 to 300 that you’d say, “Walsh, what were you thinking?” All I can do is own them and explain them and apologize as sincerely as I can for those that deserve an apology. 2020 ElectionClipsPolitics2020 electionJoe Walsh .

        "articles": "Oculus Rift creator and tech entrepreneur Palmer Luckey has been revealed to be funding the pro-Donald Trump organization Nimble America, which is dedicated to spreading Trump’s message on the internet through anti-Hillary Clinton memes and “shitposting.” 24-year-old Luckey is worth an estimated $700 million after he sold his company Oculus to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion, and his identity as the vice president of Nimble America has only just been revealed after he used a pseudonym to promote the organization on Reddit. “We believe that America has been lead by poor leaders who have abandoned American principles and sold out all Americans,” announced Nimble America in a post on Reddit last week. “With the right leadership America will reverse its course towards mediocrity and globalism, becoming great again.” “We’ve proven that shitposting is powerful and meme magic is real,” they continued. “So many of you have asked us, how we can bring this to real life. We wanted to do it in a way that was transparent and had purpose. Not just sell t-shirts to sell them, but to sell t-shirts to shitpost.” “It’s something that no campaign is going to run,” said Luckey to the Daily Beast on the subject of billboards they are planning. “I’ve got plenty of money… Money is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.” The organization has already spent nearly $10,000 on billboards, advertisements, and “website ops,” and a billboard is already being planned outside the venue of the first presidential debate. Luckey is the latest tech entrepreneur to come out in support of Donald Trump, after PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel endorsed the Republican presidential candidate at the party’s national convention in July. Thiel was also revealed to be funding Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker, which ended up leaving both the company and its founder Nick Denton bankrupt in August.
