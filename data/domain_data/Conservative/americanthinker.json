        "articles": "Now that Hillary Clinton has openly declared that Bill Clinton will be part of her campaign, it is time for the FBI to investigate the Clinton Foundation, of which Bill is the founder, for possible violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 USC 611 et seq). Since 2008, according to numerous reliable reports, the Clinton Foundation has received hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions from as many as 19 foreign countries and many significant foreign corporations. These include Algeria, Australia, Brunei, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Morocco, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Taiwan, and the UAE. During the same period, former President Bill Clinton has personally received millions in speaking fees from a number of these same nations and corporations. Common sense and an examination of the record indicate that there was no altruistic explanation for these contributions and fees. On the contrary, these foreign donors were involved in projects or activities that could have benefited politically or commercially from favorable policy decisions by the secretary of state, or from the Clintons’ global contacts. Therefore, the Foundation and the Clintons individually should be investigated for violating the Federal Agents Registration Act (FARA) for failing to register as agents of those foreign governments and failing to fully disclose these payments. The issue of donations and fees from foreign governments to the Clintons received a great deal of media attention during March and April of this year, particularly after the publication of the book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer. Since then, Hillary’s email scandal has pre-empted the attention of the press. However, we should not permit the likelihood of violations of FARA by the Clintons to fade from public scrutiny, and we should resume the demand for an investigation into what is prima facie a massive sale of influence that so far has been conducted with impunity. In fact, there may be a direct connection between payments by foreign governments to the Foundation and the email scandal, since Mrs. Clinton may well have determined that her email correspondence involving the Foundation was “personal” and therefore would not be turned over to the State Department and would ultimately be “wiped.” Well-publicized examples that suggest a direct connection between contributions to the Clinton Foundation and United States policy decisions include the sale of 20% of U.S. uranium reserves to a Russian company (2008-2010), the decision not to criticize Algeria’s human rights record (2010), changing its position on the Keystone Pipeline after the Canadian government made a major donation (2014), and a decision not to investigate a donor for violating the Iran sanctions law. FARA requires anyone who receives a payment from a foreign country or foreign entity and represents its interests in the United States to register as an agent of that country and to file regular reports (sec. 612) and to identify himself as an agent of the foreign government (sec. 614). Failure to do so is a criminal act (sec. 618). Many of these donations were not reported by the Foundation, either in its tax returns or on its website. In fact, in April 2015, the Foundation refiled five years of its 990 tax returns, an event termed “highly unusual” by experts in non-profit organizations. The Clintons also failed to keep their explicit undertaking to President Obama to desist from accepting contributions from foreign countries while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, and they did not report such contributions. While many commentators have concluded that these acts by the Clintons constitute conflict of interest, or ethical lapse, or appearance of fraud, none has pointed to a specific law they may have violated. That law is the FARA, and public interest demands that Congress or the FBI commence an investigation into such possible violations immediately, both by the Foundation and by the Clintons as individuals, since the law provides that officers and directors are personally liable (sec. 617). Bill Clinton is the founder of the Foundation and a member of the board. Hillary resigned as a member of the board in 2014 but would remain liable for what occurred during her tenure as an officer.

See also: An Appeal for Dictatorship Comes Out of the Closet at the New York Times Professor Louis Michael Seidman wrote an op-ed in the New York Times stating that we should give up the Constitution. What he writes, Obama intends. There is a community of opinion amongst modern progressives. They are both fractured souls who believe that discontinuity is superior to tradition. They want to create the world anew every day, as if free-floating values are superior to the ballast of the past. Their ideas of a brave new world without precedent represent the cowardice of minds that can't integrate various traditions and values because they are interested more in short-term hedonism than in long-term sustainability.

A State Department outpost for which she was responsible was violently attacked by terrorists. It was a planned attack. She knew that immediately but lied to the public and even dithered about which YouTube video to blame. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya, who had asked over two hundred times for increased security but was denied (by State Dept. underlings), was murdered. The city had suffered seventy-seven terrorist attacks in the previous months and still Amb. Stevens' \"facility\" was not granted any increased security. His requests \"never reached her desk.\" Not her fault according to Hillary. Taking down Ghaddafi was Hillary's baby, her grand plan. It was going to be her foreign policy success, her coup. When it went sour on her watch two months before the election, she dissembled. She repeatedly utters the words, \"I take responsibility\" which are meaningless; she has taken none. She actually, in a sideways fashion, blamed Chris Stevens for his own death because he never asked to be relieved of duty or for the embassy to be closed. He \"understood the dangers of such a post\" said Hillary. Every other Western embassy had left for obvious reasons; it was a very dangerous place. For her to admit this would have been impolitic to say the least; it belied her grand plan. It did not fit with Obama's slogan of the campaign, \"Bin Laden is dead, GM is alive, and Al Qaeda is on the run.\" The hearings yesterday were quite a spectacle. For the Democrats on the committee, they were clearly partisan. They slavishly pandered to Sec. Clinton, gushing over her in every way possible. Some of their groveling was absolutely cringe inducing. They defended each and every failure of her judgment. It was a pathetic display. The Republicans were on the defensive thanks to Kevin McCarthy but they were actually trying to get to the truth. With numerous emails to and from Ms. Clinton that proved her duplicitousness, her many, many lies and ever-changing explanations, it was a difficult task. She was cool, steely cool. She was snooty, as always. She rolled her eyes, overly-acted bored and annoyed. She truly does think she is better and smarter than the rest of us. She also believes she is above the law. According to her supporters on that committee, she apparently is above the law. Strangest of all is her argument over the last three years that Ghadaffi had to be taken out because he was about to perpetrate a genocide. There is no evidence of this at all. Big head-fake. Big mistake. Ghadaffi was a lightweight compared to Saddam Hussein and taking Ghadaffi out was her decision, her catastrophic error. She badgered a clueless President into it. Her then abandonment of Stevens' facility caused his death, the death of three others and who knows how many other terrible injuries to those who were left without their country's help, who tried to rescue them, and have been prevented from telling their stories. Can't have any of that in an election year. To this day the Left continues to besmirch George W. Bush for his invasion of Iraq even though every Western intelligence agency agreed that Saddam indeed did have weapons of mass destruction and was likely to use them. Congress approved the invasion of Iraq. Like almost every Democrat in Congress, Hillary voted to take out Saddam Hussein. And he was a genocidal maniac who had murdered thousands, employed rape rooms, brutalized homosexuals, etc. Ghadaffi had essentially already thrown in the towel, given up his nukes. Hillary's supporters do not dare mention her lack of prudence on this point. The Left has a truly repellent double standard. Accuse Romney of killing a woman with cancer? Of not paying taxes? A OK. Invent things to take out Clarence Thomas? Or Robert Bork? Brilliant. Bush was AWOL! Fabulous idea. The excesses of the most prominent Democrats like Ted Kennedy, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Carl Levin, etc. are legendary for the sheer malignancy of the fabricated personal attacks they wage. The truth does not matter to the Left. Any lie in furtherance of their agenda is a moral necessity. Hillary is just another leftist hack anxious to stay very rich, preserve and increase her power and the power of her party. Today's hearing proved this without a doubt.

        "articles": "It is ironic that one of the very, very few Republican politicians in Congress who is not a total imbecile – even his opponents concede he has a razor-sharp mind – may actually lose his seat to a rabid liberal, thereby turning the red state of Texas blue. Ted Cruz is very much like Donald Trump in that he is an outsider and deeply disliked by the Establishment Republicans and is receiving scant support from them, since they evidently prefer to see a liberal take his place rather than see him re-elected (just as they preferred to see Hillary win over Trump). The transgender-looking RINO from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, famously bragged, \"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.\" Graham despises Donald Trump as much. However, Graham has lately pretended to support Trump as the latter's popularity grows and his policies have resulted in prosperity, though it is obvious that it pains him to do so. Perhaps the hatred of both liberals and the Republican Establishment began when the Hispanic senator gave his famous filibuster against Obamacare, especially when he called them out for voting for Obamacare – something the Republicans who voted for it wish you would forget (which you probably have; some conservatives have the attention span of a mosquito). Remember, it was Ted Cruz who said, \"It is amazing that the wisdom of the chattering class to the Republicans is always, always, always 'surrender your principles and agree with the Democrats.'\" The media hate him as much as the swamp does. During his 2016 run for the presidency, Newsweek depicted his followers as Nazis (now, where have we heard that before?), which the Washington Post claimed was not proof of media bias. Sure. The Washington Post had previously printed a scathing article stating that Cruz's filibuster was just a publicity stunt. Of course. When CNN's Chris Cuomo gave out the fake news that Ted Cruz was afraid to come in to CNN and talk to him, Cruz responded, \"I'm quite certain in the history of the universe, nobody has ever been afraid of Chris Cuomo.\" Boom! Cruz is the one who went to President Trump to ask him to pardon Dinesh D'Souza. To me, the one thing that clearly differentiates Cruz from the corrupt Republican hacks is that he will bring up or confront topics that the corrupt Establishment won't so the Establishment won't get criticized by the media. For example, when Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress, Cruz was the only one to bring up the issue of Facebook censorship and grill Zuckerberg. Other (Establishment) Republicans on the committee (e.g., Sen. John Cornyn from Texas) avoided the issue altogether. Perhaps they were afraid of being \"unfriended\" by Zuckerberg. Or the New York Times. In fact, isn't it curious that so many Establishment Republicans are in favor of illegal immigration (future Democratic voters)? And isn't it also curious that with all the censorship being carried out by Twitter, Facebook, Google, Patreon, and YouTube, and with the fanatical brainwashing in universities and high schools and elementary schools, and the constant attacks by the anarchist Antifa, not one of the corrupt Establishment Republicans has said one word on those topics? What are they in Washington for? Or in the state capitals? In fact, what are they good for? So mark my words: if Ted Cruz loses to his liberal opponent, Beto O'Rourke, who is receiving a lot of support from out-of-state Democrats (including the Hollywood glitterati Chelsea Handler, Rosie O'Donnell, Sophia Bush, and Sarah Jessica Parker), the Republican establishment will be celebrating even more than the Democrats.

        "articles": "ISIS, ISIL, the Islamic State, or whatever it’s called today is a group of homicidal thugs, drunk on their own sense of power and bolstered by their military successes in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. Thousands have been murdered – and not just by a bullet to the head, but decapitated while they are alive. Thousands of women and children have been slaughtered. For those who think that the only “war on women” is perpetrated by Republicans who think that if women want abortifacients, they should pay for such drugs themselves, let me repeat that. Thousands of women and children have been slaughtered in the same way cattle, pigs, and chickens are slaughtered. A quick, humane execution? Hardly. Decapitation is not painless. It is not humane. These are the acts of immoral psychotics who actually enjoy their abuse of a position of power. And yet we should consider just who is responsible for the carnage. Yes, the primitive tribal mentality and a religious bias are factors, but one must asked, “Who was it that freed these animals to act so savagely against innocents?” And if that is not horrific enough, Yazidi women are being sold into sexual slavery. Again, how does that compare with the so-called “war on women” being decried daily by the über-feminists of the left? How does it compare with “unwanted sexual advances” on college campuses all over the Western world? This is not to say that women raised and living in a Western, Judeo-Christian based society don’t have any problems, but when compared to what Yazidi and other Kurdish and non-conforming Sunni and Shia women face, isn’t that like comparing a hangnail to a heart-attack? Who let these animals loose? The primary culprit might be viewed as our very own president. Barack Obama wanted to show how much smarter he was than George Bush. He was going to get us out of Iraq, and end “Bush’s War.” And so he did. He even went so far as to fail to negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement with the Malaki government of Iraq that would have allowed a relatively small force to remain. Had our “smartest guy in the room” been only half as smart as he thought he was, if he had a secretary of state who was more interested in doing her job than in planning to run for president herself, he might have realized that there is more to the leadership required of the president than playing golf or jetting off to fundraisers. How admirable. How praiseworthy. Just declare that the war is over, and come home. Last month I wrote a piece calling out the idiocy of our government, assuming that they could change only one variable in a situation and that everything else would remain constant. Well this situation is identical in the type of assumptions bureaucratic morons usually make. The assumption being that the removal of American forces from Iraq would have absolutely no impact, since no one else would ever change their behavior. Oops! So the bulk of Iraq is lost, and the golfer-in-chief apparently thinks that he can have a couple of F-18s drop a few bombs – apparently at random since there is no obvious strategic benefit – and voilà: his job (and his responsibility for the humanitarian disaster he allowed to occur) is done. Time to go on vacation with Michelle and his girls. Not all fathers are going to get to go on vacation with their wives and daughters, Mr. President. A lot of fathers are going to collapse tonight, knowing that their wives are being subjugated by deviants from the Islamic State (or Caliphate or whatever these animals call themselves) and are being treated as slaves. Sexual slaves. Their wives, the mothers of their daughters, are being treated as nothing more than commodities. And that, Sandra Fluke, is what a real war on women looks like. As for dads being able to at least hold their daughters and protect them from these pigs of the ISIS variety, well, that might be a problem. You see, Mr. President, not all these courageous, virile, and masculine ISIS animals confine their efforts to those who are nearly equal in strength and bravery. Fighting other real men might put them in some peril themselves, and they wouldn’t want that to happen, now would they? One father in particular will no longer be able to protect his daughter the way you think that you are protecting Sasha and Malia. Of course, he doesn’t have a small army of bodyguards, nor a rather large army of real soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines to protect his little girl. He has to do it singlehandedly, and as these photos show, he has failed. I don’t know the name of this poor man who has lost his wife and daughter. But I have seen pictures that first made my physically ill, and then made me wish I had my own personal B-52. Yes, Mr. President, this is the work of those you keep saying follow a religion of peace. This is the result of you preferring to get additional fundraising done rather than do the responsible thing and protect those from whom our government had taken all the police and military protections that we Americans take completely for granted. A cheery “Well, we’re finished here, so you’re all on your own now. Good luck!” is hardly what a responsible leader would say, yet that was effectively what you did. A website called Catholic.org was brought to my attention by someone I correspond with in South Africa. It has two photos of the gentleman I’ve described, and of his daughter. Take a good look at him, Mr. President. Take a good look at his daughter, and imagine that it could have been Sasha or Malia. Then, Mr. President, look in the mirror and try to tell yourself that it’s not your fault for opening the cage that might have controlled these animals.

ISIS, ISIL, the Islamic State, or whatever it’s called today is a group of homicidal thugs, drunk on their own sense of power and bolstered by their military successes in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. Thousands have been murdered – and not just by a bullet to the head, but decapitated while they are alive. Thousands of women and children have been slaughtered. For those who think that the only “war on women” is perpetrated by Republicans who think that if women want abortifacients, they should pay for such drugs themselves, let me repeat that. Thousands of women and children have been slaughtered in the same way cattle, pigs, and chickens are slaughtered. A quick, humane execution? Hardly. Decapitation is not painless. It is not humane. These are the acts of immoral psychotics who actually enjoy their abuse of a position of power. And yet we should consider just who is responsible for the carnage. Yes, the primitive tribal mentality and a religious bias are factors, but one must asked, “Who was it that freed these animals to act so savagely against innocents?” And if that is not horrific enough, Yazidi women are being sold into sexual slavery. Again, how does that compare with the so-called “war on women” being decried daily by the über-feminists of the left? How does it compare with “unwanted sexual advances” on college campuses all over the Western world? This is not to say that women raised and living in a Western, Judeo-Christian based society don’t have any problems, but when compared to what Yazidi and other Kurdish and non-conforming Sunni and Shia women face, isn’t that like comparing a hangnail to a heart-attack? Who let these animals loose? The primary culprit might be viewed as our very own president. Barack Obama wanted to show how much smarter he was than George Bush. He was going to get us out of Iraq, and end “Bush’s War.” And so he did. He even went so far as to fail to negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement with the Malaki government of Iraq that would have allowed a relatively small force to remain. Had our “smartest guy in the room” been only half as smart as he thought he was, if he had a secretary of state who was more interested in doing her job than in planning to run for president herself, he might have realized that there is more to the leadership required of the president than playing golf or jetting off to fundraisers. How admirable. How praiseworthy. Just declare that the war is over, and come home. Last month I wrote a piece calling out the idiocy of our government, assuming that they could change only one variable in a situation and that everything else would remain constant. Well this situation is identical in the type of assumptions bureaucratic morons usually make.

Relying on dubious and error-prone projections, politicians and bureaucrats constitutionally or statutorily limited in their power, are now exercising near-dictatorial authority in their edicts, which are effectively suspending or terminating numerous freedoms under the guise of protecting their respective nations. All Americans, not be just those with first-hand experience dealing with World War II and its aftermath or living in Eastern Europe under iron boot of the Soviet Union or escaping the Communist/socialist hellholes of Cuba, Southeast Asia or Venezuela, should view these actions with considerable trepidation. When societies lose their freedom, it is not ordinarily because autocrats or tyrants have forcibly taken it away. It is usually the result of the population willingly surrendering their freedom in return for protection against an external threat. While the threat is oftentimes real, it is invariably exaggerated. This is what we in the United States are experiencing. The general public has been stampeded by the fearmongering in the media into demanding action from the politicians at both the state and federal level. The politicians respond and do not pause to ask whether these actions will work -- just do something! They do not ask if the financial and societal cost to the nation is worth the unknown and perhaps nebulous return. Any student of history and human nature would recognize that these are the classic symptoms of collective hysteria. Hysteria is contagious. This nation is turning itself inside out as we, thanks to the media, are exaggerating the threat and not stopping to ask if the cure is worse than the disease. In times like these, it is to be expected that the citizenry will look to the government for guidance and assistance. When that happens in an environment of mass hysteria, then it is unsurprising that the state will take on or assume new power, as that is what has been demanded of it. This historically has been the process which leads to the rise of authoritarianism. Over the past four weeks and with little or no legal basis, one state governor has outbid another in their dramatic responses to the Coronavirus outbreak. Invariably their actions revolve around the curtailing of individual freedom. Arrest warrants are being issued for holding funeral services, fines are being levied for not maintaining proper distance, people are being arrested for holding gatherings of over ten people, fines and arrests are the order of the day for re-opening a business the state deems to be nonessential, and the national guard has been called out to enforce state borders and lockdowns. Pastors have been arrested for holding worship services, and in New York City the mayor has threatened to permanently close any church, synagogue or mosque that violates his lockdown order. The Second Amendment is under assault as 12 states either have ordered or are contemplating ordering all gun stores and retailers closed, thus depriving millions of their right buy a gun. Neighbors and ordinary citizens, in the best tradition of the Soviet Union and Communist China, are being encouraged to inform the authorities if anyone they know is not adhering to state lockdown rules. Stores, deemed essential by the state, are being told what in their inventory they can and cannot sell. Congress, faced with the task of mitigating the economic plight of the citizenry, chooses instead to expand the federal government’s power and influence over the private sector through a massive and bloated $2.2 Trillion spending package. Additionally, the politicians in both parties and the media, are clamoring for President Trump to declare a nationwide quarantine, nationalize industries, mobilize the military and in essence declare martial law. President Trump, in contrast to the media’s portrayal of him, has not succumbed to these overtures, as he is among the few political leaders in the nation that respects the freedoms enumerated in the Constitution. But his power over the individual state governors or Congress is limited. The defenders of these authoritarian tactics say that these extreme measures are necessary in order to save hundreds of thousands of lives. But is that just a fig leaf to permanently transform the society? This is not to say that the Coronavirus is not a serious health issue and steps must be taken to protect the most vulnerable sector of the population -- the elderly with significant medical conditions. The number of people infected with the virus over the past 30 days continues to rise as the nation has dramatically expanded testing. Of those who have died, approximately 1.6% of total infections, we do not know how many succumbed as the direct result of the virus or died of other ailments, as any death with the virus present is currently being counted as a Coronavirus fatality. The Italian evidence, for example, suggests that only in 12% of deaths is it possible to say the Coronavirus was the main cause of death. The Coronavirus started in China in early December of 2019; in the subsequent four months the virus has spread to 177 countries and more than 40,000 deaths have so far been recorded. (For updated data, click here.) At this same juncture during the Hong Kong Flu (which had many of the same symptoms as the Coronavirus) pandemic in 1968-69, it is estimated that were over 350,000 fatalities globally (40,000 in the United States). Eventually, over 1 million throughout the world (100,000 in the United States) died. In its 244-year history the United States has weathered seven of the worst pandemics in world history without the hysteria and loss of liberty and freedom. All indications reveal that the Coronavirus will be exponentially less life-threatening than any of these previous pandemics. Is the Coronavirus pandemic serious enough to warrant putting much of the nation’s population into house imprisonment, or wreaking the economy for an indefinite period of time, or prohibiting worshipers from attending their churches, synagogues or mosques, or outlawing freedom of assembly and travel, or destroying businesses that have taken years to build up, or saddling future generations with unfathomable debt? The nation is choosing to plunge millions of people into depression, heart attacks, suicide and unbelievable distress, though they are not especially vulnerable and will only suffer mild symptoms or none at all. This is what a police state is like. It is a nation in which the government can issue orders and edicts or convey preferences with no legal authority. Yet, it appears the majority of the American people are willing to sacrifice their freedoms and way of life in order to empower such a potential police state in the guise of conquering a pandemic. Governments never give up power once attained. They only seek to normalize it and now they have in their toolbox the knowledge that the citizenry will meekly acquiesce to any national emergency being declared an existential crisis which requires government to unconstitutionally impose its will on the people.

What could be more impotent than impeaching a president who is leaving office? All the same, RINO participation in this nonsense is disturbing. There are a lot of Republicans who want to work across the aisle, just like the old days. News flash: This is not politics as usual. You cannot compromise with people whose values are diametrically opposed to your own. If you both want to fix the opioid crisis but have different ideas — fine, talk it out and compromise. However, if one side wants liberty and the other tyranny, it's foolish to think you can compromise and immoral to try. The Democrats and their fellow travelers on the left have some disturbing aspirations. Just a year ago, discussion of tyranny in America would have been considered crazy talk. Not now. The temperature on this pot has been turned up slowly, and now we're at the boiling point. Just look at everything our ruling class has done in the past year. Lockdowns have restricted our movement, commerce, and assembly. Our rulers are not making us carry papers yet. That would be an inconvenience for illegal aliens. They are, however, making us wear masks to demonstrate our obedience. Big Tech oligarchs are using censorship and deplatforming to censor dissenting views. Conservative commentators such as Dan Bongino and the Conservative Treehouse have been evicted from their web servers or had their advertising revenue restricted.

Financial institutions are refusing to provide services to conservative organizations. The government was weaponized years ago, when the CIA ran spies in the Trump campaign and the FBI surveilled private citizens.

Federal prosecutors have announced that they are pursuing felony murder charges for anyone involved in the riot on January 6. However, last summer's Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots resulted in over 30 deaths (the number as of August 2020). How many felony murder charges resulted from that? Charges have been dropped against nearly all of last summer's rioters. Yet charges are still pending against those who defended themselves (such as Kyle Rittenhouse and Mark and Patricia McCloskey). So much for equal treatment under the law. It's time for every Republican to answer one question: what do you stand for? Any politician who claims to support liberty but then works with wannabe tyrants is either lying about their patriotism or just a useful idiot. It's time to choose — Vichy or Resistance.

        "articles": "I knew immediately that he was a fraud the first time I watched Barack Obama. Most people know a guy who looks good on paper, but who is really an empty suit, working an angle. Obama worked the angle. Obama parlayed his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention into an amazing career. He took faking to an entirely different level, when he decided to run for president after admitting he was not qualified. Why let that stop him? Obama represented a confluence of an \"acceptable\" black president with the Left’s desire for reparations. With a hint of Muslim in his identity with that exotic name, he had the recipe for total success, delaying Hillary Clinton's political aspirations, if not permanently dismantling them. Despite my complete disdain for Obama's policies and knowing that he would be as useless as a pocket on the back of a shirt, there was a small part of me that hoped he would not be a total failure, since he would be considered a \"first.\" We blacks have it in our DNA to cheer for the firsts. The first black heavyweight champ, tennis great, golf great, baseball great, and so on. Each of these firsts represents a piece of our proud legacy of overcoming against all odds. Nevertheless, cheering for Obama would prove to be difficult, since we disagree so vehemently. I could not support his policies, as a man who has had disdain for America cannot be my friend or leader. However I could support what Obama might represent as a first. Despite knowing Obama would be a fiscal disaster and antithetical to everything America stands for, I theorized that black liberals would be empowered by Obama for two reasons. First, I thought they might say, \"Finally, a black president, so we can move on from using race as an excuse.\" I believed, as did many Americans of all colors, that the election of Obama would erase all the excuses and blacks would revert back to the time when we demanded success, excellence, education, morality, and so on from ourselves as the necessary ingredient of personal advancement. But if black liberals didn't adopt this view, I believed that Obama would not allow excuses, given his background. He would dismiss the notion that America had failed blacks, not allowing people to fall back on poverty, single-parenthood, and the host of other excuses used by black liberals for their lack of success, and dependency on government. Neither has occurred. Obama is the divisive excuse maker, as his comments to graduates of Howard University showcased: “Be confident in your blackness” Obama said in the speech, adding, “That’s a pet peeve of mine, people who’ve been successful and don’t realize they’ve been lucky, that God may have blessed them. It wasn’t nothing you did.” I have major issues in Obama's comments, surely to be overlooked by black liberals, the media, and white Leftist enablers. To begin, what would the media and other leftists say if George Bush told graduates to \"be confident in your whiteness\"? I will allow you to ponder that; as for me, no further explanation needed. In his commencement speech, Obama may have felt the need to remind blacks to be confident, because liberals like reminding blacks that we are less than everybody else. Blacks are taught terms like \"institutional racism,\" \"white privilege,\" and many other concepts that essentially say to young blacks that the deck is stacked against them. Black liberals have built-in excuses for failure. The irony of institutional racism is that almost all of the institutional racism originates from bastions of the left; in education, entertainment, and unions, to name a few. But the next part of the Obama message was most perplexing: \"it wasn't nothing you did\" to be successful in life, it was luck. It seems that Obama is saying that your success is not because of you, your hard work, tenacity, determination, drive, focus, and the many other attributes needed for success. Obama implied that the Howard grads were just lucky. Of course, there is an element of luck in everything, and there is a saying, \"It's always better to be lucky than good.\" But it's good to be good. Obama provided a glimpse into this own views of his success, as he feels very lucky to be where he is. He must know that he was not prepared to be president, and that his performance has been dismal. Any credit that Obama gets as president is because of luck. The luck that the media is leftist, and therefore willing to accept failure of a black man, simply because he's black and a Democrat. Imagine the history of Obama, if he were a white Republican and you will get the picture. Obama is lucky that black people have not burned down Washington. Because if Obama were \"lucky\" enough to be a white Republican president, he would be the most despised president by blacks in modern history. In a time where Obama and other Leftists talk of white privilege, the luckiest man on the planet is Barack Obama, lucky to be considered black, in a world that now despises white. Barack Obama could have indeed transcended race and built on the amazing racial strides America has made in the past few decades. He squandered those gains, setting America back into the 1960's. Obama failed an entire generation of blacks, and that is the sad part of his failed legacy. Kevin Jackson is a FOX News Contributor and syndicated radio host. I knew immediately that he was a fraud the first time I watched Barack Obama. Most people know a guy who looks good on paper, but who is really an empty suit, working an angle. Obama worked the angle. Obama parlayed his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention into an amazing career. He took faking to an entirely different level, when he decided to run for president after admitting he was not qualified. Why let that stop him? Obama represented a confluence of an \"acceptable\" black president with the Left’s desire for reparations. With a hint of Muslim in his identity with that exotic name, he had the recipe for total success, delaying Hillary Clinton's political aspirations, if not permanently dismantling them. Despite my complete disdain for Obama's policies and knowing that he would be as useless as a pocket on the back of a shirt, there was a small part of me that hoped he would not be a total failure, since he would be considered a \"first.\" We blacks have it in our DNA to cheer for the firsts. The first black heavyweight champ, tennis great, golf great, baseball great, and so on. Each of these firsts represents a piece of our proud legacy of overcoming against all odds. Nevertheless, cheering for Obama would prove to be difficult, since we disagree so vehemently. I could not support his policies, as a man who has had disdain for America cannot be my friend or leader. However I could support what Obama might represent as a first. Despite knowing Obama would be a fiscal disaster and antithetical to everything America stands for, I theorized that black liberals would be empowered by Obama for two reasons. First, I thought they might say, \"Finally, a black president, so we can move on from using race as an excuse.\" I believed, as did many Americans of all colors, that the election of Obama would erase all the excuses and blacks would revert back to the time when we demanded success, excellence, education, morality, and so on from ourselves as the necessary ingredient of personal advancement. But if black liberals didn't adopt this view, I believed that Obama would not allow excuses, given his background. He would dismiss the notion that America had failed blacks, not allowing people to fall back on poverty, single-parenthood, and the host of other excuses used by black liberals for their lack of success, and dependency on government. Neither has occurred. Obama is the divisive excuse maker, as his comments to graduates of Howard University showcased: “Be confident in your blackness” Obama said in the speech, adding, “That’s a pet peeve of mine, people who’ve been successful and don’t realize they’ve been lucky, that God may have blessed them. It wasn’t nothing you did.” I have major issues in Obama's comments, surely to be overlooked by black liberals, the media, and white Leftist enablers. To begin, what would the media and other leftists say if George Bush told graduates to \"be confident in your whiteness\"? I will allow you to ponder that; as for me, no further explanation needed. In his commencement speech, Obama may have felt the need to remind blacks to be confident, because liberals like reminding blacks that we are less than everybody else. Blacks are taught terms like \"institutional racism,\" \"white privilege,\" and many other concepts that essentially say to young blacks that the deck is stacked against them. Black liberals have built-in excuses for failure. The irony of institutional racism is that almost all of the institutional racism originates from bastions of the left; in education, entertainment, and unions, to name a few. But the next part of the Obama message was most perplexing: \"it wasn't nothing you did\" to be successful in life, it was luck. It seems that Obama is saying that your success is not because of you, your hard work, tenacity, determination, drive, focus, and the many other attributes needed for success. Obama implied that the Howard grads were just lucky. Of course, there is an element of luck in everything, and there is a saying, \"It's always better to be lucky than good.\" But it's good to be good. Obama provided a glimpse into this own views of his success, as he feels very lucky to be where he is. He must know that he was not prepared to be president, and that his performance has been dismal. Any credit that Obama gets as president is because of luck. The luck that the media is leftist, and therefore willing to accept failure of a black man, simply because he's black and a Democrat. Imagine the history of Obama, if he were a white Republican and you will get the picture. Obama is lucky that black people have not burned down Washington. Because if Obama were \"lucky\" enough to be a white Republican president, he would be the most despised president by blacks in modern history. In a time where Obama and other Leftists talk of white privilege, the luckiest man on the planet is Barack Obama, lucky to be considered black, in a world that now despises white.

        "articles": "Many of my close friends in the conservative movement are NeverTrumpers. As a result, I find myself in an awkward position. The NeverTrumpers are appealing to their conservative friends based on emotional claims that I recognize as false, deluded, and selfish. One friend said, \"Who wins the election does not matter as much as the need to vote one's conscience.\" This statement is stunningly prideful and childish. The voting booth is not a ride at Six Flags, and elections are not part of a consumer experiences. The White House is not Burger King, where you get things your way. Of course who wins the election is more important than your precious conscience or how you feel about voting. Your country matters more than you do. Has America become so weak and self-absorbed that people no longer understand what it means to say, \"It's not all about you, honey\"? I guess that's why I could never be a libertarian. Part of the impasse between me and NeverTrumper friends is that they have never actually sat down and listened to the full horrors that I endured firsthand, which make it undeniable to me that this election is about stopping Hillary Clinton and saving America. Some games are won by offense, and others are won by defense; elections follow that pattern. We have to vote against things sometimes. I know that the dark side of a Clinton presidency would be not merely difficult, but also intolerable, and that Clinton as president would be incomparably more damaging than the likely flaws of a Trump presidency. Clinton must be stopped at all costs. We often say \"at all costs\" without understanding what the term means. In this case, it means voting for Trump despite whatever shortfalls one sees in him, to save America. After having served for eight years under a dean who headed the Clinton Global Initiative on my campus (see here and here and here), and after having been essentially driven out of that job, I know on a visceral and personal level what a Clinton presidency will mean. I know that conservatives, especially those who are NeverTrumpers, will be completely powerless to protect social conservatives such as myself from the crushing machine of corruption that will operate under a Clinton presidency. I know because of the reality of the last eight years I experienced under Obama. While Obama has had his share of corruption, the primary threat he posed to America was his ideology. Clinton is in a class by herself, for she has all the ideological problems of Obama plus a deceitful ruthlessness several times worse than his. Her cronies are even more ghastly. You don't know how bad things can be unless you have been a powerless pawn under a Clintonista regime. Hillary Clinton did not run the California campus where I worked, but the leadership of the dean who supervised me for eight years bore all the hallmarks of the Clinton style, which thrives wherever Clinton money flows. Clintonworld throws up the thinnest façades of helping little downtrodden groups: Latinos, blacks, gays, women who've been raped, Muslims, and even veterans (particularly veterans who were harmed by the war). All these groups are used and spit out. If they don't toe the Clinton line, they go from being special snowflake groups to targets of unshackled and gloating bigotry. Homophobia, racism, anti-veteran bigotry, and religious hostility were as powerfully wielded against me, as was any direct antipathy based on my Republican conservative politics. Under a Clintonista regime, investigations are phony, mind games become incredibly complicated, you cannot trust anybody, all conversations border on blackmail, and everybody's two-faced. The people in business attire are typically working in tandem with thugs. \"We found no evidence\" is the surefire response if someone who's unfavored files a complaint. When someone who is unfavored is the respondent to a complaint, suddenly no stone is left unturned, deadlines are extended for months and years, and any possible chance to inflict discipline without getting sued is taken. Clintonistas not only make the rules as they go along; they also break the rules they make up as they go along. After several years of working in this environment, I would wake up shaking, not knowing what was going to happen today. Would I suddenly be accused of a new crime made up out of whole cloth? Would I be shamed and slandered on the internet again? Would a student have an outburst in class, carefully timed to look random but bearing the marks of my enemies' behind-the-scenes choreography? Would I come to campus to find vandalism? Would I open my email to see yet another Orwellian trap, a reprimand based on my dean's fantasy, a fake email sent from a friend's hacked account, a threatening message from some nom de plume who might be halfway around the world or down the hall? The conservative movement cannot combat Clintonista corruption. I know, because the same NeverTrumpers who now claim he is too undignified to support were once people who drafted me into their battles. They asked me to testify and give speeches against gay marriage, even revealing things about my family life. I believed in the cause and trusted them. Then, just when my dean and her vast network of Clintonista wasps swarmed me day in and day out, I found it harder and harder to rally help. The NeverTrumpers seem to think we have no memory. Unfortunately, I remember everything in vivid detail, though I will leave these folks nameless for decency's sake. One of the NeverTrumpers once wrote emails about me behind my back, telling conservative groups to distance themselves from me because I was toxic. Another NeverTrumper sat passively while a group of hecklers shouted me down at a university lecture, and then got angry when I wrote an article about it. Catholic priests sat passively as well, letting me take the heat for defending their stances in a way none of them had the courage to do – and now scores of these types are claiming they are NeverTrumpers because Trump isn't pro-life enough or strong enough on opposing LGBT issues. Another NeverTrumper stands out in my memory as someone who emailed me to tell me I was disinvited from speaking before his group because I was too controversial. And then there are the NeverTrumpers who chastised me for making arguments that were too harsh in the lead-up to Obergefell. Those who devalued me as too vulgar hogged all the airtime and print about the gay marriage issue, lost the debate spectacularly, and then would not help me with my nightmare on my California campus. There are a shocking number of publications full of NeverTrumpers, which made it clear they would not publish any story I authored or any story about me, because I'd been too harsh toward LGBTs – merely by recounting my life experiences, applying my scholarship, and advocating for their supposed position! These are the same people who were frantically against gay marriage and then did absolutely nothing when the gay adoption cases wound up at the Supreme Court. They ignored my multiple emails asking if there were going to mobilize against gay adoption, which to me (and to many people) was a far more concerning trend than gay marriage. On March 26-27, 2015, I'd organized a trip to Washington with a half-dozen adults who'd been raised by gay or trans parents and opposed same-sex marriage on the grounds that it harmed children. Would this not have been a key group to give a platform to? Many of the think-tanks full of NeverTrumpers refused to host or even meet with us. I had flown people who should have been star witnesses to D.C. They were interviewed by reporters who were then told by conservative editors they would not run the stories; they were also greeted by twenty-something staffers in the hallways outside the offices of Republican legislators who'd scheduled meetings with us. This history matters. I am not the only person who found the web of social conservatives in Washington closed off and ineffectual. Having been in the trenches as a fighter for socially conservative causes, I cannot take the NeverTrumper position seriously. If you want Hillary Clinton to win because you feel it would be too much trouble to change gears and consider new ways of doing things, then by all means, vote for the apocalypse. Throw your vote in the trash or cast a ballot for Gary Johnson, so that Clinton can win and refashion millions more people's lives into the kind of nightmares that I survived. But NeverTrumpers have no right to rationalize what they are about to do by saying they oppose Trump because he's too liberal or too coarse. Dismissing people for being \"toxic\" is un-Christian and generally lousy behavior. Don't the NeverTrumpers know that if someone comes and bad-mouths a third party to you (\"Isn't he so gross?\"), that someone is assuredly bad-mouthing you all over town, too? How many of us can recognize the same country-club and blue-haired snobbery that we hate having to deal with in the statements NeverTrumpers make about Trump? And even if Trump's beliefs are too liberal, who cares? What have the social absolutists done for us lately? Ted Cruz's brave posturing in Congress didn't stop abortion, gay marriage, gay adoption, or transgender bathroom access. Like a broad swath of the Republican base, I'm actually not that obsessed with free-market economics. I joined the party in search of pro-faith, pro-life, and pro-family policies, not for low corporate taxes, military machismo, or union-busting. So I'm not freaked out by the prospect of a Republican president who talks about slowing immigration, raising tariffs, avoiding war, and helping American workers. I actually cannot listen to people talk about the need for a pure Republican brand without laughing hysterically. That streetcar was named Eric Cantor, my friends, and it went off the rails. Many of us are not freaked out by the fact that Trump has dallied with liberals, wasn't always that socially conservative, and doesn't necessarily agree with us 100%. That makes him human, like a lot of us whose parents did not read G.K. Chesterton to us in the crib. And when you say, \"His only qualification is that he's not Hillary Clinton,\" a lot of us say, \"Great! That's exactly what we're looking for.\" He isn't Hillary Clinton, who will bring the meanies and the whole Clinton machine, complete with all its vendettas and enemies lists, into Washington where the lefties can wage perpetual warfare against Christians. If you are a NeverTrumper, do not go dumping on Trump in my name. By that, I mean in the name of social conservatives. I was involved in national political debates just long enough to get a sense of who's who, and this game isn't working anymore. Robert Oscar Lopez can be followed at English Manif, Soundcloud, or Twitter. Many of my close friends in the conservative movement are NeverTrumpers. As a result, I find myself in an awkward position. The NeverTrumpers are appealing to their conservative friends based on emotional claims that I recognize as false, deluded, and selfish.

After several years of working in this environment, I would wake up shaking, not knowing what was going to happen today. Would I suddenly be accused of a new crime made up out of whole cloth? Would I be shamed and slandered on the internet again? Would a student have an outburst in class, carefully timed to look random but bearing the marks of my enemies' behind-the-scenes choreography? Would I come to campus to find vandalism? Would I open my email to see yet another Orwellian trap, a reprimand based on my dean's fantasy, a fake email sent from a friend's hacked account, a threatening message from some nom de plume who might be halfway around the world or down the hall? The conservative movement cannot combat Clintonista corruption. I know, because the same NeverTrumpers who now claim he is too undignified to support were once people who drafted me into their battles. They asked me to testify and give speeches against gay marriage, even revealing things about my family life. I believed in the cause and trusted them. Then, just when my dean and her vast network of Clintonista wasps swarmed me day in and day out, I found it harder and harder to rally help. The NeverTrumpers seem to think we have no memory. Unfortunately, I remember everything in vivid detail, though I will leave these folks nameless for decency's sake. One of the NeverTrumpers once wrote emails about me behind my back, telling conservative groups to distance themselves from me because I was toxic. Another NeverTrumper sat passively while a group of hecklers shouted me down at a university lecture, and then got angry when I wrote an article about it. Catholic priests sat passively as well, letting me take the heat for defending their stances in a way none of them had the courage to do – and now scores of these types are claiming they are NeverTrumpers because Trump isn't pro-life enough or strong enough on opposing LGBT issues. Another NeverTrumper stands out in my memory as someone who emailed me to tell me I was disinvited from speaking before his group because I was too controversial. And then there are the NeverTrumpers who chastised me for making arguments that were too harsh in the lead-up to Obergefell. Those who devalued me as too vulgar hogged all the airtime and print about the gay marriage issue, lost the debate spectacularly, and then would not help me with my nightmare on my California campus. There are a shocking number of publications full of NeverTrumpers, which made it clear they would not publish any story I authored or any story about me, because I'd been too harsh toward LGBTs – merely by recounting my life experiences, applying my scholarship, and advocating for their supposed position! These are the same people who were frantically against gay marriage and then did absolutely nothing when the gay adoption cases wound up at the Supreme Court. They ignored my multiple emails asking if there were going to mobilize against gay adoption, which to me (and to many people) was a far more concerning trend than gay marriage. On March 26-27, 2015, I'd organized a trip to Washington with a half-dozen adults who'd been raised by gay or trans parents and opposed same-sex marriage on the grounds that it harmed children. Would this not have been a key group to give a platform to? Many of the think-tanks full of NeverTrumpers refused to host or even meet with us. I had flown people who should have been star witnesses to D.C. They were interviewed by reporters who were then told by conservative editors they would not run the stories; they were also greeted by twenty-something staffers in the hallways outside the offices of Republican legislators who'd scheduled meetings with us. This history matters. I am not the only person who found the web of social conservatives in Washington closed off and ineffectual. Having been in the trenches as a fighter for socially conservative causes, I cannot take the NeverTrumper position seriously. If you want Hillary Clinton to win because you feel it would be too much trouble to change gears and consider new ways of doing things, then by all means, vote for the apocalypse. Throw your vote in the trash or cast a ballot for Gary Johnson, so that Clinton can win and refashion millions more people's lives into the kind of nightmares that I survived. But NeverTrumpers have no right to rationalize what they are about to do by saying they oppose Trump because he's too liberal or too coarse. Dismissing people for being \"toxic\" is un-Christian and generally lousy behavior. Don't the NeverTrumpers know that if someone comes and bad-mouths a third party to you (\"Isn't he so gross?\"), that someone is assuredly bad-mouthing you all over town, too? How many of us can recognize the same country-club and blue-haired snobbery that we hate having to deal with in the statements NeverTrumpers make about Trump? And even if Trump's beliefs are too liberal, who cares? What have the social absolutists done for us lately? Ted Cruz's brave posturing in Congress didn't stop abortion, gay marriage, gay adoption, or transgender bathroom access. Like a broad swath of the Republican base, I'm actually not that obsessed with free-market economics. I joined the party in search of pro-faith, pro-life, and pro-family policies, not for low corporate taxes, military machismo, or union-busting. So I'm not freaked out by the prospect of a Republican president who talks about slowing immigration, raising tariffs, avoiding war, and helping American workers. I actually cannot listen to people talk about the need for a pure Republican brand without laughing hysterically. That streetcar was named Eric Cantor, my friends, and it went off the rails. Many of us are not freaked out by the fact that Trump has dallied with liberals, wasn't always that socially conservative, and doesn't necessarily agree with us 100%. That makes him human, like a lot of us whose parents did not read G.K. Chesterton to us in the crib. And when you say, \"His only qualification is that he's not Hillary Clinton,\" a lot of us say, \"Great! That's exactly what we're looking for.\" He isn't Hillary Clinton, who will bring the meanies and the whole Clinton machine, complete with all its vendettas and enemies lists, into Washington where the lefties can wage perpetual warfare against Christians. If you are a NeverTrumper, do not go dumping on Trump in my name. By that, I mean in the name of social conservatives. I was involved in national political debates just long enough to get a sense of who's who, and this game isn't working anymore.

        "articles": "At this point, I understand how this prediction will be received. It’s been common belief for some time that Hillary Clinton would headline the ticket. And there’s ample reasoning to think that she will. So let’s begin there. First, she’s got something that more than half of the field doesn’t have. Namely, a pair of x chromosomes; she’s a woman (and not the Bruce Jenner kind). As such, opposition to her ascendency to the highest seat of political power in America can immediately be panned as archaic fear among a misogynistic rabble of conservative men (and the crowing of millions of simple and unliberated conservative women that are subservient to them, no doubt) before any policy positions are considered. The Republican “War on Women” farce was established during the 2012 campaign season, and it was lapped up by the media to great effect. There’s no reason to think that her campaign would not enjoy a bit of immunity due to this preceding phenomenon. Second, she’s American royalty, so to speak. I’ve had more than a few friends tell me that they don’t know anyone who likes Jeb Bush for the Republican presidential ticket. Yet here we are, listening to possibility that he’s a Republican frontrunner for no other reason than his pedigree. Similarly, Hillary hasn’t done much worthy of note, and what she has done offers no signs that she would be a qualified leader of this country (more on this in a bit). But since lack of leadership experience, considering our current two-term president, is clearly not a deal-breaker for the Democrat voting bloc, sharing her husband’s last name should carry a good bit of weight. The first two reasons lead to the third reason that Hillary is the leading candidate for the Democratic ticket. She has a potential war chest unlike anyone on either side of the field, and she will undoubtedly enjoy singularly focused media support to attain it. As Democrat Gary Hart said about the Clinton campaign’s aspiration of a billion dollar campaign, “that ought to frighten every American.” A campaign of that size is certainly formidable. Now, I know the odds are stacked against the title prediction, but hear me out. Reason 1: She’s mired in serious controversy. Yes, I know, Democrats and the gaggle of devoted Democrat voters don’t typically care when their own are the subject of controversies. They can create controversies to Republicans’ detriment seemingly at will, but they never have to account or atone for their own. Consider that Bill Clinton pursued a young intern, engaged in a sexual encounter at the White House and thereby disavowed any fidelity toward Hillary, then under oath misled a court, Congress and the American public as to the nature of that encounter. Even still, Slick Willie is a fondly remembered good ol’ boy in the Democratic ranks whose charisma is counted on (and was perhaps necessary at the 2012 DNC) to woo the Democrat masses. But the nature of Hillary’s controversy is quite different. After four Americans were killed in Benghazi, she stood amidst their coffins and told a bald-faced lie to a grieving father and the American people about their deaths being in retaliation to a YouTube film disparaging Islam. Shortly after, Congress inquired as to whether she knew, as could have been reasonably deduced at the time and was later verified, that the attacks were calculated and had nothing to do with the film. A defiant Hillary famously carped “What difference, at this point, does it make?” Then there’s the issue of her private email server, which she apparently used to “conduct official business as US Secretary of State.” Representative Trey Gowdy (R – S.C.) had “issued a subpoena for the private server” to acquire emails pertaining to the Benghazi scandal, but Americans then discovered that the server was “wiped” of about 30,000 to 60,000 emails. We are to take at her word, in a case which is specifically meant to investigate the merits of her dubious integrity, that she only had emails that were “personal in nature” deleted? Yes, that’s a rat you smell. What’s more, if you work for any company with a somewhat coherent risk management and compliance protocol in place, you’d find it downright preposterous. For example, in a recent compliance meeting for my own company, employees were warned that business is not to be conducted via personal mediums, such as text messaging, personal email, or social media. Furthermore, we were assured that all correspondence on the company server is monitored and stored for future review. One colleague in attendance asked how long the emails are stored, and the one-word answer that followed was “forever.” Without missing a beat, another colleague was not shy about saying aloud, “Unless you work for the IRS or the State Department.” His response was met with a shoulder shrug by the compliance officer. The point is, the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal email server to conduct official business, and certainly the disappearance of the emails, represents a level of deceit that would not be tolerated outside of the realm of corrupt government agencies. And the perceived level of corruption in this current administration leads to reason number two. Reason 2: Hillary represents the unpopular Washington status quo. I touched on this reason in an American Thinker article published in August of 2014, titled “Democrats Face the Republicans’ Familiar Dilemma in 2016.” Hillary’s lack of political traction was evident, signified by a painfully dismal reception to her book, Hard Choices, and all the early discussion about “Hillary fatigue” seemed even then to be an anchor to her presidential ambition. Having served as Secretary of State for Barack Obama was undoubtedly meant to pad her résumé (though for reasons aforementioned, may have yielded more harm than good), but an ancillary result of that service is that she is bound to the Obama administration in terms of public perception. This creates the uncomfortable circumstances in which she now finds herself. The New York Times posits that “Republicans are betting that attacks based on the incumbent’s record will be as effective against Mrs. Clinton as the tactic was in 2008, when Democrats equated a victory by John McCain to four more years of President George W. Bush.” The ultimate premise of this Times piece, however, is focused on the nuance in how Hillary may embrace Obama, while simultaneously distancing herself from him just enough to represent something fresh. Doing that, however, even with her impressive credentials as a “mother and a grandmother” which might appeal to women voters as the Times suggests, might be a difficult dance to time. The left loves the notion of change because change, for whatever reason and by whatever unwritten rationale, means progress. And for the left, nothing is more important than the belief that progress is being made. So for Hillary to appeal to Americans, she needs to represent new ideas, a new direction, and above all, she needs to deliver all of that with charisma and appeal to the masses. Which leads to reason number three. Reason 3: She’s Hillary Clinton. In 2008, Hillary was the clear frontrunner for the Democrat ticket. Seriously, it was all but a given, and Republican strategists undoubtedly planned for it as the likeliest of outcomes. And yet, Hillary was roundly rejected by Democrats in 2008, trounced in the primaries by a junior Senator from Illinois with little more to his credit than a good 2004 DNC speech and having been president of the Harvard Law Review -- a publication in which he never published one article. A charismatic community organizer-turned-neophyte politician capitalized on an unpopular incumbent, social disdain for the status quo, and ultimately, a weak competitor in the Democratic primary. Yes, Obama had the added benefit of a sickeningly powerful command of the black voting demographic (96%, all said and done in 2008), not to mention the added benefit of his campaign being a method to atone for white guilt. But the simple fact is that Hillary possesses none of the qualities that have won her husband popularity, nor any of the qualities that won Barack Obama the Democratic ticket. In short, Hillary Clinton lacks charisma, and the Democrat powers-that-be may soon come to understand that they can only exploit her appeal as a potential woman president and her name recognition only so far before that reality sets in. Hillary has bouts where she is unendurable and indeed, unmarketable as a speaker and as a personality. Her shrill and pathetic barking of “Yes, we will!” in 2008 as an effort to leech from Barack Obama’s popular “Yes, we can!” slogan comes to mind, as does her “I’m sick and tired of being called unpatriotic” diatribe, to name just a couple of examples. To the extent that she’s been tested in terms of engaged public discussion, she’s proven she can be less than poised when pressed, i.e., suggesting that it makes no difference whether she lied about the reason for four Americans’ deaths. Given the assumed weight of presidential debates these days, does the Democratic establishment really want her going toe-to-toe with, say, a Ted Cruz or a Rand Paul? And the political baggage that she now carries will only hasten Democrats’ understanding of these things. If there is anyone else, as I imagine there will be, that seems the slightest bit more capable of headlining the Democratic ticket, Hillary will not.

Justice Alito noted that fraud does not have to be shown before a state can act to take legitimate measures to prevent fraud. He also indicated that \"disparate impact\" must be shown to be significant before overturning a state's voting laws.On the matter of \"disparate impact,\" Justice Alito pointed to the use of statistics to mislead, rather than to inform. He observed that the Ninth Circuit found that twice as many minority voters cast ballots out of their assigned precincts as non-minority voters, based on 99.5% of nonminority voters compared to 99% of minority voters voting in their home precincts. Justice Alito indicated that the more accurate picture focuses on the 99% for minority voters, not the difference between 0.5% and 0.0%. That is to say, in absolute terms, the disparity between 99.5% and 99% is insignificant. Justice Alito noted that the dissent would treat any disparity as significant. He also had some sharp words to say of the dissent by Justice Elena Kagan: [T]here is nothing democratic about the dissent's attempt to bring about a wholesale transfer of the authority to set voting rule from the States to the federal courts.This observation might well be directed at House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Charles E. Schumer, who are pressing for legislation that would federalize elections.The dissenters, all three appointed by Democrat presidents, would disregard a state's interest in preventing voting fraud, or voter intimidation, and enthrone a federal approach, supported, in reality, by the Democrat majorities in House and Senate, plus the Democrat president. It is, therefore, difficult to escape the rank partisanship of the dissent in approving Democrat moves to increase, vastly, the numbers of voters who are registered Democrats.One can expect howls of condemnation to come from zealous Democrat partisans like the New York Times and the Washington Post, which would use misleading statistics to exaggerate voter disparity and would dismiss rules against fraud if fraud has not been shown. But on that expected argument from the undemocratic left, here is Justice Alito: \"Fraud is a real risk that accompanies mail-in voting even if Arizona had the good fortune to avoid it.\" He commented, further, \"A State doesn't have to wait for fraud to happen.\"An observer might be excused for allowing that the Supreme Court's opinion in Brnovich was its way of throwing a sop to Donald J. Trump, conceding that fraud can occur by means of ballot collection, early mail-in voting — and out-of-assigned-precinct voting, with the added concession that mail-in votes just might result from intimidation or pressure on the voter. Now imagine the High Court's ruling if Merrick Garland had made it to the Supreme Court and Donald J. Trump had failed to be elected in 2016.

        "articles": "Just in time for the immigration debate in the House, the Obama administration sent a memo to ICE agents telling them they couldn't arrest and deport illegal alien parents who had minor children. Washington Times: The Obama administration issued a new policy Friday that says immigration agents should try not to arrest and deport illegal immigrant parents of minor children. The move adds to the categories of people the administration is trying not to deport. In a nine-page memo, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said agents should use \"prosecutorial discretion\" to try to avoid detaining parents and, if parents are detained, agents should make sure they have the ability to visit with their children or participate in family court proceedings. The move won praise from immigrant-rights groups who said it's a step toward a less harsh detention policy. But a top Republican blasted the memo as another effort by the Obama administration to circumvent the law. \"President Obama has once again abused his authority and unilaterally refused to enforce our current immigration laws by directing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to stop removing broad categories of unlawful immigrants,\" said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert W. Goodlatte, Virginia Republican. Mr. Goodlatte, whose committee is in charge of many of the immigration bills the House could consider later this year and who is working on a legalization bill for young illegal immigrants, said the Obama administration move \"poisons the debate\" and shows the president is trying to \"politicize the issue\" rather than work for a compromise bill. The memo is the latest in a series of directives issued by ICE and by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that try to lay out priorities for who the government will detain and try to deport. Ms. Napolitano says her department is only funded to deport about 400,000 immigrants a year, out of a total population of about 11 million. She said it makes sense to focus those deportation efforts on immigrants with serious criminal records or who have repeatedly violated immigration laws. You can be sympathetic to the families while understanding that the situation they're in would not have arisen if they hadn't snuck across the border in the first place.What having minor children if you're an illegal has to do with immigration enforcement is a mystery, except that anytime children are involved, the open borders crowd makes sure to pour on the melodrama. The policy is pure pandering to Hispanics. Democrats are apparently desperate to lock up the Hispanic vote for 2014, given how far they've fallen with other groups. No doubt La Raza and their ilk will cheer the non-enforcement of the law. Hat Tip: Ed Lasky Just in time for the immigration debate in the House, the Obama administration sent a memo to ICE agents telling them they couldn't arrest and deport illegal alien parents who had minor children.

        "articles": "Since the end of Ronald Reagan’s second term, the Republican Party establishment has subtly denigrated and deliberately diminished the influence of the conservative movement within their ranks. Despite the fact that conservatives are by far the largest faction within the party, this strategy has been successful as there was no one of the stature of Reagan to assume the leadership mantle of the movement, and, as the political system of this nation can only function with two political parties, there is no alternative political party. Over the past 28 years, by manipulating the nominating process and controlling political contributions, the party elites have made certain that no viable conservative could win the presidency or assume a major leadership role in Congress. As the Democratic Party has increasingly embraced a policy of unabashed socialism, those that would have been considered liberal (or just moderately socialist) over the past three decades have been migrating to the Republican Party, finding a home among the so-called establishment. Thus when the Democrats won the presidency and initiated a variety of statist programs (most notably under Barack Obama) there was little or just token opposition to them. The Tea Party movement came about not only as a reaction to the policies of Obama but the spineless response of what was supposed to be the opposition party. It was this faction together with the overall conservative movement that dramatically altered Congress in two mid-term elections, giving the Republicans control of both houses. However, the vitriol directed at both the Tea Party and conservatives by not only by the Democrats and their lackeys in the media but from the Republican establishment was not only astonishing but beyond the pale. The true colors of the party leadership were on display for all to see. That arrogance and obstinacy, together with the abject failure to stop the Obama agenda while conditions for the nation’s lower and middle class continued to deteriorate, has eventuated in a very volatile Republican electorate. Oblivious to this reality, the party elites have again attempted to stack the deck against any genuine conservative winning the presidential nomination. They did so by making certain in the early stages of the process that nearly all the states favorable to a conservative candidate, many with open primaries and all with proportional delegates chosen, were on the schedule. As there are always a number of conservatives running, this strategy assures that no one conservative would come out with a significant lead, leaving the chosen candidate to do well in the later winner-take-all states which, coincidentally, are generally favorable to so-called moderates or the ones hand-picked by the establishment. However, in the Unites States of 2016, these well-laid plans, successful in the past, have failed miserably with the entrance of Donald Trump into the race, as he has inadvertently taken advantage of the process set up by the party elites. As a nationally known celebrity with a near clinical case of narcissism as well as the willingness to, without compunction, play on the angst of the Republican electorate, he has been able to assume the lead in the primary process and become the odds on favorite to win the nomination, despite winning on average just 35% of the votes cast. There are, unfortunately, some who claim to be conservative who have become enamored with Donald Trump. They are deluding themselves into believing what they belittled when Nancy Pelosi said of Obamacare: “We have to pass the bill. So you can find out what is in it.” They now are essentially saying they are willing to elect Trump on the premise that he has to win in order to find out who he is. Donald Trump is not a conservative by any stretch of the imagination. He is the embodiment of a progressive in the mold of Bill Clinton or Chuck Schumer and would govern the same way. If he is the nominee and wins the general election, the Republican Party will become the Democratic Party of the 1980’s and 90’s as the Democrats assume the role of the nation’s socialist party. However, in the general election the Democrats and their media sycophants will portray Trump and all his myriad personal flaws and ever changing positions as a stereotypical “conservative” who hates women, and is a racist as well as a rapacious and immoral businessman. As Trump’s personal unfavorables are so high, it is highly unlikely he can beat any Democratic candidate this fall, thus leaving the nation at the mercy of unfettered socialism. In either scenario, with the nomination of Donald Trump the conservative movement is destined to be cast into the wilderness for perhaps a generation, as there will be no vehicle, i.e. political party, in which they can assume control of the levers of power. This nation will be well on the way into fully evolving into a Euro-Socialist Democracy. The ideals of individual freedom, economic opportunity and government of and by the people will just be slogans chiseled in marble at various national monuments. The Republican Party elites will have succeeded in casting out conservatism from their midst, but at the cost of eliminating any opposition party and eventuating the further decline of the United States.

        "articles": "As we are now well into July, plans for the 2021–2022 school year are ramping up. For many school systems, the first day of school is less than one month away. Given this, and in order to make sure that the government schools maintain as much control as possible over American children, the COVID-worshiping media are again ramping up the Wuhan Virus panic porn. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) is no exception. With an opinion piece entitled, \"To mask or not to mask: Why's that even a question in schools?,\" the AJC's chief education writer, Maureen Downey, bemoans the fact that \"[a]lmost all Georgia school districts will leave it to parents to decide whether their kids wear masks when they return to school next month.\" In addition to its authoritarian tone, Ms. Downey's lengthy column is rooted in three false premises: 1) unvaccinated children are in danger from the Wuhan Virus, 2) there's a \"new COVID variant\" that places children in new danger, and 3) masks work.There's a mountain of data (much of it chronicled here and here) that reveal that masks and lockdowns are unnecessary (and often dangerous) when it comes to slowing or preventing the spread of the Wuhan Virus and that children — vaccinated or not — are in very little to no danger from the Wuhan Virus. As far back as August of last year, the data made clear that children were in virtually zero danger from the Wuhan Virus.Numerous school districts across the U.S. — especially private schools, and especially those in GOP-led states — did not shut down, did not mandate masks or social distancing, and had no Wuhan Virus–related problems. Ms. Downey also pushes the false notion that, because of the close contact that most sports require, high school athletes are in more danger from the Wuhan Virus. On this she writes, \"However, the findings do suggest athletics, especially indoor, pose a higher infection risk than outdoor spaces or classrooms. 'We need to have special policies in place to protect athletes,' [Zimmerman] said.\" We most certainly do not need \"special policies\" to protect athletes from the Wuhan Virus. Data from the NFL make this clear. Earlier this year, the NFL and the CDC published a paper that showed that in over 256 NFL games, and for well over 1,000 practices (probably closer to 2,000) involving 32 teams and over 2,000 players, there was zero evidence of \"on-field transmission.\" In addition, as we already well know, even if kids \"get infected\" (have a positive test result), they are very unlikely to get sick.My 12-year-old son and my 14-year-old daughter both played basketball this past season. There were few to no masks at every game, in every gym (often the gyms were packed; I have photographic and video evidence), and we had no Wuhan Virus–related issues throughout the season. Two of my sons and my daughter competed in a karate tournament in early February of this year. It was held in a local high school gym. There were hundreds (approximately 500) in attendance (again, I have photographic and video evidence). Again, there were no Wuhan Virus–related issues. This has played out countless times across the U.S. (including Super Bowl parties) where the Wuhan Virus fear porn has been ignored. To further the false narrative that children are in significant danger from the Wuhan Virus, Ms. Downey cites CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. Downey declares, \"At a recent symposium, she [Walensky] said COVID-19 has resulted in 471 U.S. pediatric deaths, more than the flu in recent years.\" This is the second time in recent weeks that the AJC has reported this number.As of about two weeks ago, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association reported 336 child deaths from COVID-19. What's more, these numbers are for nearly 1.5 years. That's a far longer period than death totals given for a typical flu season. According to the CDC, the 2018–2019 flu season saw approximately 480 deaths due to influenza in children.The AJC also wants the public frightened over the much-hyped \"Delta variant\" of the Wuhan Virus. Ms. Downey's piece is subtitled \"With a new COVID variant and no vaccine for young kids, study affirms masks matter.\" On the date of this writing (7/8/21), the lead story on the front page of the AJC website begins, \"As a highly contagious delta variant spreads in Georgia, the number of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations is ticking upward, particularly in pockets with low vaccination rates, state data shows.\" Yet CDC data continue to showcase rates across the U.S. in every age bracket near zero:Hospitalizations across the U.S. also remain significantly lower:(Go here to see the hospitalization rates for various age groups across the U.S. and every U.S. state.)Almost all that we hear from the fear porn peddlers in the left-wing media of the Delta variant is that it is \"highly contagious\" or \"easily transmissible.\" Tony Fauci himself said, \"The Delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the U.S. to our attempt to eliminate COVID-19.\" First of all, we likely will never completely \"eliminate\" the Wuhan Virus. Secondly, we are told that the \"vaccines\" protect against the Delta variant, and more importantly, the Delta variant is significantly less lethal than the original virus. Again, this is especially the case with children.In pushing her mask-up agenda, Ms. Downey references a \"new study out of North Carolina.\" Downey writes, \"Reaffirmed by results in several other states, the North Carolina data showed masks were a key factor in limiting the spread of the coronavirus in school buildings.\" Downey quotes extensively from \"the study.\"First of all, it isn't \"a study,\" but rather a \"report\" on an \"analysis\" of data. The report does declare, \"Wearing masks is an effective strategy to prevent in-school COVID-19 transmission.\" However, the information in the report makes no indication that \"COVID-19 transmission\" in schools with mask mandates was compared to those without mask mandates. There has been plenty of analysis of data comparing areas with mask mandates to those without. As I have noted often, the data do not support the position of the mask apologists.In early May, Scott Morefield at Townhall reported on data from Brown University professor Emily Oster. Morefield writes: In areas of high community transmission, masked school students saw a case rate (defined here as daily cases per 100,000) 37 percent higher than non-masked school students, or 19 cases per 100,000 in 'no masks required' schools vs 26 in 'masks required' schools. Even worse, staff experienced a case rate 84 percent worse in masked schools, at 19 cases per 100,000 in 'no masks required' schools vs 35 in 'masks required' schools. Also, even if children in schools are forced to mask up, it is almost always a clownish activity. Given that children almost universally hate the masks, they constantly have their hands on them, and if they have them on, they almost never wear them properly. Noted epidemiologist Carl Heneghan pointed this out as he made the case in April of this year against mandating masks in schools.The AJC is the largest newspaper in the southeastern U.S. With the tremendous decline of U.S. newspapers, that doesn't mean what it used to. Nevertheless, like most others in the left-wing media, for over a year now, the AJC has pushed the lockdown narrative when it comes to schools and such.

        "articles": "It looks like the Democrats are executing a multi-faceted four-prong bait-and-switch cover-up strategy to deal with the sex scandals of both Rep. John Conyers and Sen. Al Franken – and the Clintons. First, Rep. Conyers and Sen. Franken’s resignations are a clear signal to the drive-by media to immediately stop any and all investigations and reporting by accusers and alleged victims of both Rep. Conyers and Se. Franken. Essentially, the Democrats are directing the drive-by media to focus entirely on Republican Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore’s alleged sexual misconduct and President Trump’s endorsement of his candidacy. Second, Democrats want to send a message to the public that they have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct by any elected representatives - regardless of party affiliation or whether the misconduct was perpetrated before or after they were elected. The media will do their part in messaging and extol the Democrat Party brand as the moral authority when it comes to women’s rights - especially when it comes to sexual misconduct against women. Republicans, on the other hand, will be branded by Democrats and the drive-by media as the “war on women” party that embraces sexual misconduct by its members against women. The drive-by media will pound this narrative 24/7 from now through both the 2018 and 2020 elections. Third, and probably most importantly, Democrats want to make sure there are never any congressional ethics investigations of sitting Democrat representatives involving sexual misconduct. The Democrats do not want any further evidence or accusers to come to light during an investigation – and especially evidence that may lead to other hidden sexual misconduct by Democrats. Democrats know the drive-by media would have to cover any ethics investigations; which would not serve them well going into the 2018-20 elections. The fourth part of the Democrat strategy is on a more personal level for both Rep. Conyers and Sen. Franken. It is highly plausible that the Democrat powers that be could almost guarantee both Rep. Conyers and Sen. Franken that they will never be held accountable for their actions – either by a Congressional ethics Committee or by a civil legal action. It’s a pretty sure thing that the “enforcement” arm of the Democrat Party will do whatever needs to be done to keep all of their accusers out of the public eye and out of court. Finally, what sets Judge Roy Moore’s situation apart from both Rep. Conyers and Sen. Franken is that the people of Alabama, not the media, political pundits, the U.S. Congress or the President of the United States, will decide if Roy Moore qualifies to be a U.S. Senator or not. The people of Minnesota and the 13th congressional district of Michigan did not have an opportunity to judge Sen. Franken and Rep. Conyers with respect to their alleged sexual misconduct. In which case, both Sen. Franken and Rep. Conyers had to deal with their alleged sexual misconduct within the confines of Congressional rules, politics and unfortunately, public opinion. In Judge Moore’s case, the people will make the final decision. By the way, this was also the case with then candidate Donald Trump. Amid allegations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Trump, the people of America got to decide whether he was qualified to be president of the United States or not. And the people, not Democrats or the drive-by media, made that decision. If the Republicans can get their act together and successfully communicate to the public that the Democrats and the drive-by media are colluding to pull off one of the biggest political bait-and-switch cover-ups in history, they may be able to flank both the Democrats and the drive-by media cause serious political damage regarding this issue in the 2018-20 elections. It looks like the Democrats are executing a multi-faceted four-prong bait-and-switch cover-up strategy to deal with the sex scandals of both Rep. John Conyers and Sen. Al Franken – and the Clintons. First, Rep. Conyers and Sen. Franken’s resignations are a clear signal to the drive-by media to immediately stop any and all investigations and reporting by accusers and alleged victims of both Rep. Conyers and Se. Franken. Essentially, the Democrats are directing the drive-by media to focus entirely on Republican Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore’s alleged sexual misconduct and President Trump’s endorsement of his candidacy. Second, Democrats want to send a message to the public that they have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct by any elected representatives - regardless of party affiliation or whether the misconduct was perpetrated before or after they were elected. The media will do their part in messaging and extol the Democrat Party brand as the moral authority when it comes to women’s rights - especially when it comes to sexual misconduct against women. Republicans, on the other hand, will be branded by Democrats and the drive-by media as the “war on women” party that embraces sexual misconduct by its members against women. The drive-by media will pound this narrative 24/7 from now through both the 2018 and 2020 elections. Third, and probably most importantly, Democrats want to make sure there are never any congressional ethics investigations of sitting Democrat representatives involving sexual misconduct. The Democrats do not want any further evidence or accusers to come to light during an investigation – and especially evidence that may lead to other hidden sexual misconduct by Democrats. Democrats know the drive-by media would have to cover any ethics investigations; which would not serve them well going into the 2018-20 elections.

        "articles": "Seeking to bypass the cliunky and glitchy website healthcare.gov, the Obama administration is looking at major changes regarding how people sign up for insurance and receive subsidies. People interested in buying health insurance under Obamacare could soon skip the HealthCare.gov website and apply for coverage and financial assistance directly with private insurance companies and online brokers, the Obama administration said Tuesday, in its latest effort to work around the faulty website. Health insurers and online brokers like eHealth have always sought the ability to let consumers to apply for subsidies to cut their health insurance costs without using HealthCare.gov, the online portal to health coverage in more than 30 states. But technological snafus with the system linking insurers to the federal government ruled out that option, even as HealthCare.gov itself has remained problematic. Now these insurance issuers and brokers are about to get what they want. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is close to providing insurers with the technological capability to also take subsidy applications, as well as sell plans to customers, spokeswoman Julie Bataille said during a conference call with reporters Tuesday. \"We've put in place a number of the most important fixes. This is something that issuers are going to look at within the context of their own systems, and I believe that, in the coming days, as they make their own assessments, they will make determinations about what may be appropriate,\" she said. Activating the \"direct enrollment\" option would free health insurers and online brokers to accept applications from people who are eligible for subsidies, thus widening the potential universe of people who wouldn't need to use HealthCare.gov to get health insurance. Although going directly to a health insurance company or a private broker would mean consumers couldn't comparison shop for all available options, it would make it easier to obtain coverage for next year in advance of the Dec. 15 deadline to choose a plan that will be in place on New Year's Day. The full enrollment period runs until March 31. Previously only those who visited the exchanges were able to apply for a federal subsidy. With the new rules - not yet finalized - consumers should be able to go through the entire process of signing up for insurance, figuring their subsidy, and paying their premiums by contacting the insurance company or an online broker. We're looking at tens of millions of people needing to get insurance so you can expect bottlenecks and slow websites for insurers also. More importantly, these changes signal that the Obama administration is not going to entertain any ideas about delaying the indivudal mandate. No matter how much trouble consumers have in purchasing insurance, that's not their problem. If a way is open for a taxpayer to buy insurance, they will be forced to do so or pay the fine.

We could have walked away from the Middle East already and left them to their own savagery, but the president insists that we remain inextricably tied to their historical need to kill each other so that we can overpay for oil, both monetarily and with American lives. Thus, as technology enables us to break free of dependence upon Middle East oil, our president bends over backwards to ensure that never happens. What sort of leader purposefully compels his country and its people to participate in practices and policies that are detrimental to their safety and survival? Even worse, when he can be shown to have chosen sides, his allegiance rests with terrorists and psychopaths. His affinity for Islam and its practitioners, as seen in the influence he grants them in the formation and direction of U.S. policy, is well known. Outspoken detractors of the United States and proponents of worldwide Sharia are welcome guests at the White House. They have infiltrated the highest levels of our government. They direct the content of discourse and training about who and what they are. Our blindness toward their hatred and objectives, and perhaps our administration's shared stake in that hatred of the United States, was manifested in the obscene spectacle of a Muslim cleric insulting and damning our dead special forces troops at their own memorial service. That event was a natural consequence of the sort of brainless political correctness that pervades the left. So too was what Nidal Hasan did at Fort Hood. Such \"tolerance\" is a top-down phenomenon. Who doubts that what Hasan did was terrorism? Of course, for the terrorist, what he does is soldiering for his cause. It is eternal war for the supremacy of Islam, not terrorism as such, and in the eyes of the jihadist, the enemy always has it coming. To the jihadist, it is no more terrorism than if a U.S. Marine fires on the enemy in battle. But why does the administration not see what Hasan did as terrorism? They had to call it something for public consumption, and since the president does not see a premeditated attack on his own unarmed service men and women in the global advancement of Islam as terrorism, it defaulted to \"workplace violence\". Apparently terrorism is defined not by ideology or method, but by location. Still, to so blatantly lie about something so obvious, without the slightest concern over pushback by those who see the lie for what it is, or who suffer its ill effects, is passive aggression on steroids against America. When the president picks who he will support and who he will condemn on the international stage, he consistently sides with those who hate the United States and the Judeo-Christian principles upon which it was founded. President Obama has willfully enabled Iran to develop a nuclear weapons program entirely without resistance, other than UN sanctions, which have failed. In Egypt, Mubarak's faults were well documented, but so too were his assets in terms of peace and stability in the Middle East. Nevertheless, the president purposefully aided his overthrow in order to replace him with members of an organization, the Muslim Brotherhood, which collaborated with the Nazis and which has, at its core, goals and objectives that are antithetical to the security and safety of the United States. Similarly, Libya had taken no overt aggressive action against the United States, but a band of Islamic terrorists expressed their desire to obtain control over another territory in North Africa, so the president did what he could to help. Had they been Americans in need, he would have given them the comfort of a stirring, rehashed speech, but when a decisive commitment is needed by a gang of armed jihadis that would as soon kill Americans as look at them, he's Johnny-On-The-Spot. And now there is Syria. Any objective actor, seeing the ratio of success-to-failure of his past decisions, might step back and engage in a bit of introspection. No one person has done more to destabilize the Middle East than \"Peace Prize Obama\". The death and repression in foreign lands attributable to the decisions of this one man is shocking. Societies are literally transformed for the worse by what he says and does, both at home and abroad. But President Obama either doesn't do introspection, or has no need for it because he is doing exactly what he has set out to do. He is not failing. He is succeeding. He is enabling those with whom he sympathizes, or with whom he shares a common enemy, to achieve spectacular success. We have no place whatsoever in the Syrian civil war. It is not for the United States to put its military weight behind which gang of Muslim murderers wins control. But there was no role we needed to play in Egypt, either, on the same reasoning. Likewise, we had no reason to go in and destabilize Libya. But faced with the choice of stability and predictability versus creating a vacuum into which our enemies would step to seize yet more power, the president purposefully chose to assist our enemies. It's what he does. Having abetted Iran, and having successfully ruined Egypt and Libya in aid of our enemies, President Obama is now willing to \"go it alone\" to achieve.... another power grab by those who would happily kill us once we have enabled them to seize control of another government, its military, and its stockpiles of weapons, both conventional and otherwise. Of course, he has no legal authority to go it alone, but publicly states his willingness to take an action that would be in direct violation of the Constitution and the limits on his powers. What could possibly be so important to this president that he would create for himself grounds for impeachment by misusing our military to support yet another band of Muslim fanatics? There have been reports that the Benghazi attacks on September 11, 2012 were a direct consequence of an illegal weapons smuggling operation to aid the Syrian rebels. Since the administration is engaged in wholesale coverup to prevent the truth from ever emerging, and no other plausible explanation has been offered, there are reasons to believe that theory may be true, and that the details of this president's support for our enemies would be catastrophic if revealed. Even without the facts, we can see for ourselves that for the first time in our history, we have a president who is actively, purposefully aiding and arming enemies whose ideology, goals and success directly threaten our safety. Oddly, our president's only successes have come on behalf of our enemies. In every respect, the United States is in decline domestically, internationally, culturally, and economically, as a direct result of this president's policies and actions. It is not that there are no other solutions, but that he refuses to implement those that would arrest the descent and reverse course. As President Obama succeeds in advancing our enemies and destroying us, we cannot help but notice that this has been happening for 5 years and shows no sign of slowing. Nothing so prolonged, requiring so many purposeful choices, is an accident. For President Obama, success has meant making our enemies stronger and better equipped to challenge us, with our ultimate submission as their stated objective. With each of Obama's successes, they obtain control of increasing levels of weaponry they can use to advance militant, radical Islam throughout the world. They make no secret of their plans for non-Muslims. Just ask the Copts and other Christians in Muslim-controlled countries everywhere. In case the churches have been destroyed, you can find them in the jails. Regardless of party affiliation, what do we call that brand of overt, shameless betrayal of an entire nation, or the complicity of those citizens who vote for it or remain silent in the face of it?

According to research done by the Gallup Organization: Americans who have been out of work for a year or more are much more likely to be obese than those unemployed for a shorter time. The obesity rate rises from 22.8% among those unemployed for two weeks or less to 32.7% among those unemployed for 52 weeks or more. Gallup tracks U.S. obesity levels daily using Americans' self-reported height and weight to calculate body mass index (BMI) scores as part of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. Individuals with BMI scores of 30 or higher are considered obese. The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index also tracks the percentages of Americans who report that they have ever been diagnosed with various health conditions related to obesity, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. People who are unemployed but have access to plenty to eat are not only less motivated to seek any kind of work, even work lower paying than their previous employment, they have more leisure time on their hands, and may eat to ease the psychological pain of feeling unwanted and useless that unemployment brings up for many. But once they become fat, they become even more unemployable: One key concern raised by the current analysis is that employers in industries that require manual labor, such as manufacturing and construction, may be less likely to hire candidates who are clearly out of shape. If so, workers in these industries -- who already earn lower wages, on average, than those in knowledge-based sectors -- may be even more likely to be caught in a negative cycle of joblessness and poor health. More broadly, private employers' high healthcare costs might lead them to avoid taking chances on those who pose greater health risks, particularly in a tenuous economic climate. As a result, candidates who are obese and who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more may have two strikes against them even before they sit down for an interview. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and certainly the provision of food to those who have limited incomes bespeaks good intentions. But it also may lead many to behavior that is not onbly unhealthy, but which limits their prospects of returning to gainful employment. Food stamps may be a key factor driving long-term unemployment.

        "articles": "Of all holidays, Easter is the one that celebrates a single event that transformed the world forever. There are many religions with different founders, prophets, and teachers going back thousands of years, but only one of them has a founder who professed to be the messiah – the son of God who could save mankind. Jesus was born in a Jewish family and lived and walked among the people of Israel. Every year, Jesus's parents took his family to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. On one such occasion, when he was twelve, Jesus got separated from his parents and made his way to the temple, where he sat with the esteemed teachers – listening, asking questions, and teaching. According to Luke 2:47, \"[e]veryone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.\" Later, when his adult ministry began, Jesus drew thousands upon thousands who flocked to hear him. No one else in human history made the claims Jesus did to be able to deal with every last problem of the human heart. One primary reason the Bible is a perennial bestseller is that it's the most complete owner's manual to the most complex creation of all – the human species. Nowhere else can one find as succinct yet comprehensive an explanation of what God's love is all about than in the Bible's Psalms and Jesus's teaching through parables. Another unique quality about Jesus is that he welcomed people whom no other religious leader would be caught dead with – society's rejects, reviled tax collectors, and prostitutes. By caring for outcasts and the disenfranchised, Jesus showed a radical level and standard of mercy and love never seen before. Once, when Jesus was having dinner with a Jewish Pharisee, a woman convicted by her own sin came to Jesus to wash his feet with her tears and hair and then apply expensive perfume. His host was aghast at the immoral woman's presence, but Jesus responded that God's work is to forgive sinners, and that those who are forgiven much can then love much. Utterly unique in other ways, Jesus performed many miracles, healing the sick, blind, crippled, and deaf – the news of which traveled throughout the land, prompting many more to seek him out. And he healed them all. Jesus also confronted evil head on and drove demonic spirits out of people dangerously possessed and abandoned by society. His work did not stop with miraculous healing. Because God himself became flesh in the person of Jesus to save people through their own faith, he went on to demonstrate his love and power in an ultimate way that could not be missed or denied: bringing the dead back to life. One such resurrection miracle was that of Lazarus, who was irrefutably dead and entombed for four days. Upon Jesus's command, Lazarus got up and walked out of the tomb – that people would know beyond a shadow of a doubt who Jesus was. All other religions require works to achieve enlightenment and salvation. Christianity turns that on its head: faith in Christ and all his teachings transforms the heart, from which good works naturally follow. In saying, \"My yoke is easy and my burden is light,\" Jesus presents an ingeniously compelling appeal that even the most hardened cynic can't easily refuse. Skeptics of the Bible's truth and the reality of Jesus need understand that there's actually much more reliable historical evidence for his life, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection than there is evidence for any other historical figure of ancient times. Consider that no one doubts the authenticity of the life and acts of Alexander the Great. Yet there are only two original biographical accounts of his life, which were written by Arrian and Plutarch some four hundred years after Alexander died. The manuscripts of Virgil and Horace, both of whom lived within a generation of Christ, were written more than four centuries after their deaths, yet no one doubts that they lived and authored poetic masterpieces. Looking at the big picture, there are about 1,000 times as many manuscripts preserving the New Testament (about 25,000) than other classical ancient works with the exception of Homer, whose Iliad is backed by 1,800 manuscripts (but still less than one tenth of the New Testament number). We know the historical Jesus mainly through four different accounts known as the Gospels – Matthew, Luke, Mark, and John – all written within a generation or two of Jesus's life. Matthew and John provide eyewitness accounts from their years of walking with Jesus as disciples. Mark also had eyewitness experience. Luke, the doctor, learned about Jesus from his friend Paul, the apostle who wrote most of the letters of the New Testament. Easter is the commemoration of the single event that transformed the world forever – the resurrection of Jesus after his death on the cross. That God would send his Son to die as a sacrifice for the sin of all who would believe in Him is an unbelievable gift – beyond most people's comprehension. That a resurrection and a joyous eternal life await believers is beyond anything anyone could imagine. That is the promise and essence of Easter.

        "articles": "Conservatives are patriots. When we see an American president in trouble, we tend to see his problems as our own. Which makes it hard to know how to react to Obama's troubles in Syria. I am going to make an unusual case here that Obama's Syrian stumbles actually benefit the United States and the civilized world. If that sounds odd -- well, it is. I can think of only one precedent: Jimmy Carter's punch in the nose from Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, which caused American voters to elect Ronald Reagan instead. Reagan speedily restored respect for America in the world. For one thing, as soon as Reagan was elected Khomeini released his US hostages in Tehran. Ten years later the Soviet Empire crumbled. Looking back, it seems that Jimmy Carter and his NSC advisor Zbig Brzezinski actually helped the sadistic Khomeini regime rise to power after pulling the rug out from our ally, the Shah of Iran. Apparently Carter thought the United States deserved to lose Iran as an ally because of what happened in 1953, almost three decades before, when Stalin was in power in the Soviet Union. This is plainly insane, but Carter and Brzezinski still defend their screwy reasoning today, while the Iranian theocracy kills its young people and commits aggression against us. In the upshot, defeating Carter was a very good thing for the United States and the West. Obama is the second fervently anti-American president we have seen. That was hard to accept for a long time, but after the overthrow of our longtime ally Mubarak in Egypt, after Obama's active support for the Islamofascist Muslim Brotherhood, after the Benghazi arms-smuggling operation to Al Qaida-allied rebels in Syria, and now, after Obama's selective outrage against Syrian poison gas attacks in a civil war where 130,000 Syrians have died -- after all those facts I don't think Obama is running a pro-American policy any more. After all, Obama is running the \"apologize for white folks\" administration. It's the \"American guilt\" administration. It's the \"bow to tyrants\" administration. All that stuff looked like a farce when it happened. But it turns out to be the real Obama. While we were scratching our heads about his oddball president, his tiny inner circle -- Obama, Jarrett, Michele, Axelrod -- were going Go 'Bama! Bow down to another murderous tyrant, please! If that seems perverse, it was. This is the most perverse administration in American history. By now it's impossible to avoid the conclusion that Obama is fervently anti-American. Which is what you might learn from his personal history, all the way from Mom the Stalinist, to his \"mentor\" Frank Davis the child pornographer, all the way to the \"Reverend\" Jerry Wright and the Alinsky Machine in Chicago. They all sing the same song, and love for America is never part of it. There's no way Obama could have been marinated in that toxic stew all his life and not come out as a feverishly anti-American ideologue. Today we see the proof. Five years ago, after Obama was elected by our America-loathing political class, the One delivered his Message to the Muslim World from Al Azhar University in Cairo. We now know that Obama's speech signaled a radical reversal of American policy, flipping 180 degrees to support Jihadist war cults like Al Qaida, the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's mullah cult. On the face of it, supporting your deadly enemy in a time of war is insane. But this is Obama. Maybe he explains it to our Chiefs of Staff as a clever way to split the Sunnis from the Shiites. Lying is Obama's biggest talent, and no doubt he spins his actions in different ways to different people. But look at the facts. Obama is now exposed as having directly supported Islamic jihad cults in Egypt, Libya, and Syria. He has done it in close coordination with the Islamist regime of Recip Erdogan in Turkey and with the Muslim Brotherhood in America. There is a good reason why Huma Abedin was Hillary's \"personal aide\" as Secretary of State. Huma had worked as a magazine editor for the MBs, and her close family is Muslim Brotherhood. There is not much doubt where her loyalties lie. (The fact that Tony Weiner the penis texter is married to Huma suggests that Tony has at least one other talent: Swinging enough money from the Brotherhood to run for mayor of New York. Just a wild guess, you understand. For all I know, Tony might the best qualified guy in Manhattan.) But let's get back to Obama. Wherever Obama saw a chance he has tried to shaft our Middle East allies, including Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Netanyahu in Israel, and even the Saudis, who hate Obama's retreat in the face of their biggest threat, Iranian nukes and missiles. The Saudis live right across the Persian Gulf from Iran, and Khomeini tried to overthrow them thirty years ago. They haven't forgotten that. Still, the Arabs have resisted Obama as much as possible. They have suffered a great deal. Today, Egypt is still in chaos. Libya is in a civil war. Millions of Syrians have fled from the war between Sunni radicals (supported by Obama) and the Assad regime. No wonder the Saudis are trying to make a deal with Vladimir Putin. America used to protect its allies. Today we just shaft them. On top of that Obama has orchestrated a retreat from Afghanistan by negotiating with the Taliban -- remember them? They are the sadists who blow up girls' schools over there, because women should never be educated. They also harbored Osama bin Laden and Al Qaida in the run-up to 9/11/01. Without the Taliban, the Twin Towers would still be standing in Manhattan. Today Obama is trying to make friends with them. Obama has bowed low to the priesthood of Iran, now under \"moderate\" president Rouhani, who commanded their attack on the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983, killing 241 Marines on a peacekeeping mission. \"Moderate\" Rouhani also takes public credit for suckering the Americans long enough to build 17,000 working uranium centrifuges someplace in Iran. In brief, none of Obama's actions have served our country and our allies. Judging by five years of Obama foreign policy, he is radically anti-American, just like all his friends. This is all of a piece with Obama's domestic contempt for the Constitution, as shown in his flaming abuse of the IRS, the FBI, the NSA, EPA, DOJ and who knows what else. We've got the fox in our chicken house. Fortunately, this particular fox has a fixed habit of trying to gnaw its own tail off. Should Americans hold their breath and hope he keeps failing? Obama is a blunderer. He is arrogant and ideologically blind, so he always acts in an overconfident way that ignores realities on the ground. Obama routinely gets suckered by the rug merchants of Persia and the chess players of Russia. In some weird way this means we might survive him after all. Here are some specifics. 1. In Egypt Obama was directly involved in stirring up the vaunted \"Arab Spring,\" which was a gambit to bring the radical Muslim Brotherhood to power. In the end, modernist Egyptians rebelled against the MBs, and today our friend Brother Morsi is awaiting trial for inciting the murder of Egyptian civilians. 2. In Libya, Obama's Ambassador Christopher Stevens helped to whip up a rebellion against Muammar Gadaffi, helped by direct US and NATO bombing. Yet Gadaffi had kept the peace in Libya for decades, and had surrendered his nuclear program to the Bush Administration. He posed no danger to us. The Libyan adventure was a blatant double-cross of Gadaffi. Obama's bizarre Libyan policy was exposed in the Benghazi fiasco. Ambassador Stevens was in bandit country of Benghazi, far from the capital of Tripoli, supervising CIA arms shipments of Libyan arms to the Al Qaida rebels in Syria. He made alliances with Al Qaida gangs, who ended up stabbing him in the back, the way they always do. In the end the Qaida types got away with burning the CIA \"annex\" on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11/01, a symbolic date if ever there was one. They also bagged 400 ground-to-air missiles, which can be used to shoot down civilian airliners for years to come. Benghazi was a huge defeat for the Obama \"policy,\" and it ended up exposing him just before the last election. That is why it had to be covered up by a bizarre pack of lies that no sane observer believed. Benghazi exposed Obama's pro-Jihadist policy for all the world to see. It was a sad day for America, but it was worse for Obama's anti-American shenanigans. Benghazi was the beginning of public exposure for radical ideologue Obama, the man who suckered us in two presidential elections. Both Egypt and Libya were Obama gambits to shaft our allies and support our enemies in the Jihad War. Whether his inner cult figured they were splitting the enemy, or whether they were simply running a subversive anti-American policy, is hard to tell. In any case, the American people need to know the truth, and Congressional hearings are the only way they ever will. Now comes today's Syria fiasco. 3. In Syria, Obama allied with Turkey and Saudi money men to stir up a Sunni revolt against Assad. The Assads, father and son, are pretty evil, as we know by now. But they are not worse than the Al Qaida maniacs who seem to be running the \"Free Syrian Army.\" Assad at least promised stability. Al Qaida doesn't believe in stability. We are therefore facing a lose-lose situation in Syria. If Assad wins, the Iranians will threaten U.S. allies including Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. So we lose in Syria -- no matter which side wins. How's that for brilliant American statesmanship? A few weeks ago this column warned that Obama was getting trapped in Syria. Today the trap has snapped shut, and Obama's self-inflicted wounds are making headlines around the world. And while he is trying to evade the consequences of his folly by making the U.S. Congress responsible, in fact this is the fifth year of Obama's overreach and the resulting failures. So here is Obama's scoresheet. 1. Egypt: Massive overreach and failure. 2. Libya: Massive overreach and anarchy, plus the Benghazi fiasco. 3. Syria: Another overreach and a classical lose-lose trap. But here's the real kicker. Obama's failurex may be good for America and for the world. I can't remember a time when a major foreign policy defeat looked like good news for the United States. But then I can't remember a time when a president was so perversely anti-American. In these strange times, Obama's five years of overreach and defeat in the Muslim world must be considered good news for civilization. Conservatives are patriots. When we see an American president in trouble, we tend to see his problems as our own. Which makes it hard to know how to react to Obama's troubles in Syria. I am going to make an unusual case here that Obama's Syrian stumbles actually benefit the United States and the civilized world. If that sounds odd -- well, it is.

On the face of it, supporting your deadly enemy in a time of war is insane. But this is Obama. Maybe he explains it to our Chiefs of Staff as a clever way to split the Sunnis from the Shiites. Lying is Obama's biggest talent, and no doubt he spins his actions in different ways to different people. But look at the facts. Obama is now exposed as having directly supported Islamic jihad cults in Egypt, Libya, and Syria. He has done it in close coordination with the Islamist regime of Recip Erdogan in Turkey and with the Muslim Brotherhood in America. There is a good reason why Huma Abedin was Hillary's \"personal aide\" as Secretary of State. Huma had worked as a magazine editor for the MBs, and her close family is Muslim Brotherhood. There is not much doubt where her loyalties lie. (The fact that Tony Weiner the penis texter is married to Huma suggests that Tony has at least one other talent: Swinging enough money from the Brotherhood to run for mayor of New York. Just a wild guess, you understand. For all I know, Tony might the best qualified guy in Manhattan.) But let's get back to Obama. Wherever Obama saw a chance he has tried to shaft our Middle East allies, including Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Netanyahu in Israel, and even the Saudis, who hate Obama's retreat in the face of their biggest threat, Iranian nukes and missiles. The Saudis live right across the Persian Gulf from Iran, and Khomeini tried to overthrow them thirty years ago. They haven't forgotten that. Still, the Arabs have resisted Obama as much as possible. They have suffered a great deal. Today, Egypt is still in chaos. Libya is in a civil war. Millions of Syrians have fled from the war between Sunni radicals (supported by Obama) and the Assad regime. No wonder the Saudis are trying to make a deal with Vladimir Putin. America used to protect its allies. Today we just shaft them. On top of that Obama has orchestrated a retreat from Afghanistan by negotiating with the Taliban -- remember them? They are the sadists who blow up girls' schools over there, because women should never be educated. They also harbored Osama bin Laden and Al Qaida in the run-up to 9/11/01. Without the Taliban, the Twin Towers would still be standing in Manhattan. Today Obama is trying to make friends with them. Obama has bowed low to the priesthood of Iran, now under \"moderate\" president Rouhani, who commanded their attack on the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983, killing 241 Marines on a peacekeeping mission. \"Moderate\" Rouhani also takes public credit for suckering the Americans long enough to build 17,000 working uranium centrifuges someplace in Iran. In brief, none of Obama's actions have served our country and our allies. Judging by five years of Obama foreign policy, he is radically anti-American, just like all his friends. This is all of a piece with Obama's domestic contempt for the Constitution, as shown in his flaming abuse of the IRS, the FBI, the NSA, EPA, DOJ and who knows what else. We've got the fox in our chicken house. Fortunately, this particular fox has a fixed habit of trying to gnaw its own tail off. Should Americans hold their breath and hope he keeps failing? Obama is a blunderer. He is arrogant and ideologically blind, so he always acts in an overconfident way that ignores realities on the ground. Obama routinely gets suckered by the rug merchants of Persia and the chess players of Russia. In some weird way this means we might survive him after all. Here are some specifics. 1. In Egypt Obama was directly involved in stirring up the vaunted \"Arab Spring,\" which was a gambit to bring the radical Muslim Brotherhood to power. In the end, modernist Egyptians rebelled against the MBs, and today our friend Brother Morsi is awaiting trial for inciting the murder of Egyptian civilians. 2. In Libya, Obama's Ambassador Christopher Stevens helped to whip up a rebellion against Muammar Gadaffi, helped by direct US and NATO bombing. Yet Gadaffi had kept the peace in Libya for decades, and had surrendered his nuclear program to the Bush Administration. He posed no danger to us. The Libyan adventure was a blatant double-cross of Gadaffi. Obama's bizarre Libyan policy was exposed in the Benghazi fiasco. Ambassador Stevens was in bandit country of Benghazi, far from the capital of Tripoli, supervising CIA arms shipments of Libyan arms to the Al Qaida rebels in Syria. He made alliances with Al Qaida gangs, who ended up stabbing him in the back, the way they always do. In the end the Qaida types got away with burning the CIA \"annex\" on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11/01, a symbolic date if ever there was one. They also bagged 400 ground-to-air missiles, which can be used to shoot down civilian airliners for years to come. Benghazi was a huge defeat for the Obama \"policy,\" and it ended up exposing him just before the last election. That is why it had to be covered up by a bizarre pack of lies that no sane observer believed. Benghazi exposed Obama's pro-Jihadist policy for all the world to see. It was a sad day for America, but it was worse for Obama's anti-American shenanigans. Benghazi was the beginning of public exposure for radical ideologue Obama, the man who suckered us in two presidential elections. Both Egypt and Libya were Obama gambits to shaft our allies and support our enemies in the Jihad War. Whether his inner cult figured they were splitting the enemy, or whether they were simply running a subversive anti-American policy, is hard to tell. In any case, the American people need to know the truth, and Congressional hearings are the only way they ever will. Now comes today's Syria fiasco. 3. In Syria, Obama allied with Turkey and Saudi money men to stir up a Sunni revolt against Assad. The Assads, father and son, are pretty evil, as we know by now. But they are not worse than the Al Qaida maniacs who seem to be running the \"Free Syrian Army.\" Assad at least promised stability. Al Qaida doesn't believe in stability. We are therefore facing a lose-lose situation in Syria. If Assad wins, the Iranians will threaten U.S. allies including Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. So we lose in Syria -- no matter which side wins. How's that for brilliant American statesmanship? A few weeks ago this column warned that Obama was getting trapped in Syria. Today the trap has snapped shut, and Obama's self-inflicted wounds are making headlines around the world. And while he is trying to evade the consequences of his folly by making the U.S. Congress responsible, in fact this is the fifth year of Obama's overreach and the resulting failures. So here is Obama's scoresheet. 1. Egypt: Massive overreach and failure. 2. Libya: Massive overreach and anarchy, plus the Benghazi fiasco. 3. Syria: Another overreach and a classical lose-lose trap. But here's the real kicker. Obama's failurex may be good for America and for the world. I can't remember a time when a major foreign policy defeat looked like good news for the United States. But then I can't remember a time when a president was so perversely anti-American. In these strange times, Obama's five years of overreach and defeat in the Muslim world must be considered good news for civilization.",

This, in turn, has provoked a debate over whether the Founders considered complete substitutes to be valid amendments. A recently-republished piece of evidence suggests that they did. The Constitution’s Origination Clause requires that “All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.” Because the final version of Obamacare imposed a variety of taxes, it unquestionably was a “Bill for raising Revenue.” Obamacare’s taxes, appropriations, and health care regulations did not exist in the House-passed version of H.R. 3590. That incarnation of the bill was only a few pages long and was limited to making minor adjustments to the Internal Revenue Code irrelevant to health care. Under the guise of amendment, the Senate gutted the original language and substituted over 2,000 pages of Obamacare. Some writers argue that complete substitutions were not considered valid amendments during the Founding Era, while others contend that they were. Last year, I undertook a wide-ranging investigation into the subject that will be published within the next few weeks by the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy. The article is summarized at length here. I found that complete substitutions may have been unknown in the British Parliament, one source of the Constitution’s House origination rule. I also found, however, that they were occasionally used in several states between Independence and the time the Constitution was ratified, and that they were considered valid amendments in those states. This year, the Wisconsin Historical Society issued two new volumes of the magisterial Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution. Those volumes cover the debate over the Constitution waged in Maryland from 1787 through the end of 1788. The first of the volumes reprints a pamphlet written in favor of the Constitution by “Aristides,” the pen name of jurist Alexander Contee Hanson. Hanson was a respected figure in Maryland, and his pamphlet was read widely both in that state and in Virginia. At one point he addressed the question of whether the Constitutional Convention exceeded its authority on the (substantially false) assumption that the delegates’ commissions had been limited to proposing amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Hanson argued that proposing a substitute was a recognized form of “amendment”: Amendment, in parliamentary language, means either addition, or diminution, or striking out the whole, and substituting something in its room. Hanson’s assertion is particularly relevant to the Constitution’s original meaning because his own state legislature is not among those offering contemporaneous evidence of complete substitutions. Hanson was reflecting, in other words, an understanding that extended beyond his own state’s boundaries. Unfortunately for advocates of Obamacare, the validity of complete substitutions as “Amendments” does not resolve the issue of constitutionality. During the Founding Era, even complete substitutes had to be connected to the subject matter of the original bill – or, in modern language, “germane” to the original. Otherwise, they were new bills, not valid amendments. For reasons documented in my article, H.R. 3590 as passed by the House qualified constitutionally as a “bill for raising Revenue” (even though it was revenue-neutral) because it amended the tax code. Under Founding-Era rules, all the Senate’s revenue changes were germane to the original, and therefore valid. However, the Senate-added appropriations and regulations were not germane to the subject of revenue. By including them, the Senate exceeded its authority to amend a “bill for raising Revenue.” This means that by the Founders’ understanding of the Origination Clause, those additions were unconstitutional and void.

        "articles": "People who pride themselves on rational thinking know there are few feelings worse than being wrong about something, especially something that they made a big noise about at the time. What helps lessen this intellectual humiliation is understanding that, given the information available at the time, the decision was a rational one at the time. The remedy for the initial error is to use the newly available information to reach a more reasoned decision. As the campaign season goes forward, we’re learning more about Donald Trump’s politics and seeing his initial ebullient puckishness too often give way to self-referential arrogance and venomous hubris. Now is a good time for Trump supporters to use this new information to revisit their original conclusion about him and to realize, with no shame attached, that he’s not the candidate they thought he was. When Trump first appeared on the 2015 political scene, he was a breath of fresh air. Most conservatives enjoyed his irreverence in tweaking the media rules favoring Progressives and demonizing conservatives -- rules before which Republicans had long bowed down. It was galvanizing to hear Trump state in plain English that we need to address the holes in immigration that allow Islamic terrorists easy entry, even if doing so meant temporarily stopping all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to separate the moderate wheat from the murderous chaff. Likewise, Hillary’s opponents enjoyed his refusal to allow Hillary’s double-X chromosomes to stifle the fact that the only woman Hillary supports is Hillary. To that end, she enabled her husband’s predatory, misogynistic sexual misbehavior for more than thirty years. Trump was the first Republican to remind everyone how appalling and hypocritical Hillary’s behavior has been. Early on, Trump was loud about conservative positions: Securing our borders; supporting Israel; ending the abortion culture, and protecting Second Amendment rights. It therefore seemed as if the dream conservative candidate was presenting himself. Here was a man who bulldozed the political correctness that stifles conservative thought and who openly, and in simple language, embraced conservative positions. Based upon that information, it was eminently reasonable to support Donald Trump. The media also encouraged Trump’s candidacy. He was good for ratings and they considered him un-electable. Given the media’s overwhelming progressive bias, they wanted to advance a Republican candidate they were sure would lose. They therefore gave him 25 times more coverage than the rest of the GOP field combined. That’s a lot of free advertising in a nation that appreciates colorful characters. For months, then, for someone bewildered by the exceptionally crowded Republican field, Trump seemed like the answer to seven years of Obama’s efforts to turn America into another saggy, flabby semi-socialist country; to hand the Middle East over to Putin; and to tear down our national security by destroying America’s borders and having our military focus obsessively on climate change and social re-engineering. That was then. This is now. Now the opposition research is finally coming to light, and it seems that Trump (shame on him, not shame on you) has been lying to America’s conservatives. Up until he threw himself into this election cycle, Trump was the very model of a modern elite Progressive. Moreover, as the campaign progresses, his current statements give the lie to his past promises. Specifically: Trump on party affiliation: Trump changes political parties like Will Smith’s son changes clothes -- with frequent regularity and without any coherent belief system driving his decisions. When it comes to an ideological home, Trump has never demonstrated fixed principles. In a present, fixed principles are nice. Trump on political donations: For decades Trump has donated to both Democrats and Republicans. In 2006, he donated heavily to Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, helping them retake Congress from the Republicans. Over the years, even when donating to both Democrats and Republicans, Democrats got the larger share of the wealth. Some say that, as a wise businessman, Trump needed to keep both parties happy -- an argument that ignores the fact that his donations skewed Left over the years. However, when you’re voting for president, wouldn’t you prefer someone who was guided over the years at least a little bit by principle, not just profit? As a conservative, would you ever, under any circumstances, donate to Nancy Pelosi? If you answer “no” to that question, you need to ask yourself why you’re forgiving the same conduct in Donald Trump. Trump on socialized medicine: Conservatives don’t like socialized medicine or semi-socialized Obamacare. Why? Because: (1) The only way government can control costs is to ration care -- which is why old people in England are so often put on death pathways. (2) Without market competition, medical care providers can get away with murderously bad behavior. The VA, which traps veterans in a socialist medical hell, is a perfect example. (3) The preeminent WHO study Leftists cite to disparage the American system was a con, having as its highest metric the fact that a medical system is socialized, and giving scant attention to actual outcomes. (4) The data used to compare American outcomes to those in other nations is often apples versus oranges, falsely disparaging American care. (5) Conservatives know that, in medicine, as in all other aspects of the economy, the free market is the surest way to achieve the best product at the lowest prices, something as true for buying medical insurance as it is for buying medical care. But what does Donald Trump believe? According to a recent interview, it turns out that Trump supports fully socialized medicine, with the government as the only paying customer (using dollars it forcibly extracts from taxpayers, of course) I am going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now. [snip] I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. [snip] The government’s gonna pay for it. Please realize that what Trump is advocating is an even purer from of socialized medicine than Obamacare. The latter at least clings to a pretense of the free market insofar as it still allows insurance (even though insurers are forced to provide government-controlled insurance and consumers are forced to buy that insurance or go without). Trump’s dream, however, is as pure as Britain’s National Health Service, where everyone sees a doctor for free, but the care is abysmal those deemed too expensive to care for (the old and very sick) are left to die. Trump on eminent domain for crony benefit: If you’ve heard the phrase “eminent domain” tossed about a bit regarding Trump, but aren’t quite sure what it is, here’s a quick primer: The Fifth Amendment allows government to forcibly purchase private property for a fair price if that purchase is for the public good (e.g., roads or reservoirs). The Supreme Court, in Kelo v. City of New London, fundamentally changed traditional eminent domain principles by removing the public good from the equation. Kelo held that government can force the sale of private property to another individual citizen (usually a large developer) for the latter’s financial benefit. The standard is no longer the public good, but the possibly that a development might increase tax revenue. A decision that allows government coercion in the service of cronyism is as bad as it gets. Trump, however, liked crony-based eminent domain. The only thing that stopped Trump in the 1990s from using government force to seize a widow’s home so that he could build a parking lot was a pre-Kelo court decision holding that government could not use eminent domain to benefit one of its cronies. Trump currently professes to value eminent domain only in its purest, constitutional form. Trump’s history, though, which he hasn’t disavowed, shows that he has no compunction about using government force as his private economic army. Trump on the Iraq War: During the South Carolina debate, Trump savagely attacked Jeb Bush by claiming that George W. Bush lied to get America into war. Trump added that, with his usual acumen, he always knew that the Iraq War would be a disaster. Given South Carolina’s support for Dubya, Trump showed a disturbing intemperance in attacking him. Conservatives may argue about the wisdom of the Iraq War, but they don’t believe Bush lied. They believe instead that he made his decision on the best information available at the time. Whatever else Bush was, he wasn’t a liar. The lead Republican candidate shouldn’t sound like a Daily Kos blogger. Trump’s alleged insights and long-standing anti-war stance are also untrue. Trump believed as early as 2000 that Iraq was working to get WMDs. Moreover, in the critical time from 2001-2004, there’s no evidence that Trump ever said a word about the wisdom of going into Iraq. Trump lied on that South Carolina stage and he slandered a good man, as well as all the people who supported that good man. During a recent press conference, Trump made a profoundly ignorant statement about pre-War Iraq. He praised Saddam Hussein. Iraq today, says Trump, Iraq a “Harvard for terrorism,” not because Obama’s premature withdrawal created a vacuum into which terrorism flowed, but because before the war “Saddam Hussein understood and he killed terrorists.” Wow. Just wow. Aside from giving the anti-War Left and Barack Obama a complete pass, that’s just historically wrong. The reality is that Saddam Hussein, in addition to using genocidal terrorism against Iraqi Kurds, and generally terrorizing his own people, routinely funded and sheltered terrorists. In the face of this newly revealed re-write of his own personal history and ignorance about Iraq, is Trump really ready to lead America on foreign policy? Trump on Israel. Politically-conservative Jews, some of whom I know well and respect greatly, flocked to Trump because, when he first hit the campaign trail, he was unabashed in his support for Israel. He forcefully criticized Obama’s approach to Israel, and recognized that Obama’s agreement with Iran sold Israel down the river. His open support for Israel, combined with his recognition that Islam is a threat to the West, made him an appealing candidate for people tired of RINOs who did little to stop Obama. Recently, though, Trump has backed down from supporting Israel. He now insists that he’ll be “neutral” about the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Neutrality, of course, implies that he finds each side’s position reasonable, and therefore cannot take sides. Those who support Israel do not agree with this moral relativism. On the one hand, you have a liberal democracy that extends full civil rights to all of its citizens, that opens its religious sites to all comers, and that has repeatedly traded land (and prisoners) for peace. That would be Israel, a dynamic, life-oriented, pro-capitalist nation that has long been a friend to America. On the other hand, you have a totalitarian theocracy that wants a blood purge of the Middle East, making it judenrein; that is misogynistic, homophobic, anti-American, anti-Christian; that uses peace initiatives as an opportunity to expand its killing abilities; that hides behind civilians during war; and that recently has been encouraging its young people to stab to death as many Israeli citizens as possible. And between these two parties, Trump now professes neutrality? I don’t think so. In addition to moral relativism, Trump’s recent statements reveal him to be all over the board when it comes to whether a deal can be brokered (probably not except he can probably do it) and who’s really at fault in the Middle East (they’re both bad but Israel maybe isn’t trying). If you support Israel, shouldn’t this new information change your belief that Trump will support the only liberal democracy in the Middle East? Trump on Planned Parenthood: Donald Trump has claimed since 2011 that he is pro-Life. Fair enough, even if his pro-Life views are rather strange. What’s disturbing is that Trump still supports Planned Parenthood. In 2011 alone, Planned Parenthood aborted 333,964 babies, with special emphasis on aborting minority babies (something that would have made Margaret Sanger proud). Whether they’re pro-Life or not, conservatives understand that it’s wrong for American taxpayers to provide 45% of Planned Parenthood’s funding. If the issue really is “women’s health,” there are many other women’s health clinics that provide comprehensive healthcare short of abortion. Planned Parenthood’s insistence that it doesn’t use federal dollars to pay for abortions is meaningless. Money is fungible, after all, and the dollars it doesn’t have to spend on paying for utilities, supplies, and staff, can go to abortion services. For the financially-savvy Trump, who understands money’s fungibility, to continue to support Planned Parenthood makes no sense. Trump on Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton is Donald Trump’s opponent in this race, and we can be sure that he will rip her to shreds (although he’s currently more interested in shredding Republican candidates, a circular firing squad approach to the primaries that is terribly damaging to the conservative brand). In the past, though, Trump thought highly of Hillary. When Trump married his current wife, in 2005, the Clintons attended. Seven years later, in 2012, he was raving about the wonders of Hillary: Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman. I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard. Trump also admired Hillary as Secretary of State: “I think she really works hard and I think she does a good job. I like her.” Admittedly, Hillary has moved to the Left recently in a bizarre attempt to outflank Communist Bernie Sanders, but she’s was in 2005 and 2012 pretty much what she’s always been and still is now: A woman who’s used men and trampled on other women to achieve her political rise; an ideologue who dotes on her vision of Big Government; a compulsive liar; and someone who seems drawn to corruption like a moth to a flame. If Trump can’t explain the reason he’s turned on Hillary, other than his personal ambition to get to the White House, it’s reasonable to believe that Trump’s current attacks on Hillary are merely to assuage his new conservative base and have nothing to do with his core faith in her. Trump on overseas labor: Trump shot to fame on the subject of immigration. His first line of attack was against the Muslims the Obama administration wants to admit, even though the administration concedes it current cannot vet incoming immigrants for terrorist ties. Having succeeded with this stance, Trump expanded the immigration debate to say that he intends to stop illegal immigration altogether by building a wall and forcing Mexico to pay for it. Many conservatives agree with Trump’s willingness to speak bluntly on the issue of illegal immigration. A sovereign state must have control over its borders; otherwise, it’s Rome when the barbarians overwhelmed it, first by unlimited immigration, then by force of arms. Except. . . . Except that it appears that Trump’s anti-immigrant stance doesn’t extend to protecting American workers. Trump talks about immigrants taking American jobs or, worse, having American jobs shipped right out of the country, but Trump’s business practices don’t support his words. Trump’s line of clothing is manufactured overseas and has been for a long time. Moreover, Trump has been lying about this for a long time too, telling everyone he doesn’t ship jobs overseas when, in fact, he does. Character matters. The whole overseas labor issue does not reflect well on Trump’s character. Trump on Putin: Conservatives have been concerned that Barack Obama has welcomed Vladimir Putin as a Middle Eastern savior. Starting with Syria, Obama basically turned the Middle East over to Putin who is using his new status there, along with the cozy relationship he’s always had with Iran, to resurrect the Cold War glories of Russian world domination. What’s freaky is that Trump views Putin the same way -- as a great guy to work with, as someone who can get the job done in Syria, and as a potential ally. Really? Trump’s dishonesty. All politicians puff and shade the narrative. They are, after all, selling a product (themselves) and we accept that they’re going to heighten the good stuff and downplay the bad stuff. And then there’s Donald Trump. What was not obvious at the end of 2015, when Trump was gaining a foothold with fed-up conservatives is that Trump is a Hillaryesque liar. Take, for example, Trump’s bankruptcies. During the South Carolina debate, Trump denied ever filing for bankruptcy. In fact, Trump has filed for bankruptcy four different times to prop up his business. Trump’s claim that his campaign is entirely self-funded is also untrue. In fact, the majority of his campaign money comes from donors. Likewise, those donations Trump solicited for veterans, implying that they’d go directly to veteran’s causes, instead go into his personal foundation. And as noted above, Trump has consistently lied about his willingness to circumvent American labor for cheap overseas worker. Trump’s stability: When his run for the White House was still something of a lark, Trump’s pugnacious style was leavened with a bit of humor and cheer. He was his reality-TV self -- pushy, outspoken, but kind of goofy/funny. Recently, though Trump has become darker and meaner in his attacks on his opponents? It started with the spat with Megyn Kelly. If Trump wanted to make war with the media . . . well, whatever. Since then, though, Trump’s increasingly in your face, vicious, and often obscene or bizarre attacks on his primary opponents are becoming worrisome. Take, for example, Trump calling Cruz a “pussy.” This is silly because Cruz is disliked by Senate RINOs because he is willing to stand and fight. What’s more upsetting is that a candidate would use a sexual insult in a national forum. It’s worse than just tone, though. The bigger issue is whether we want as President someone who resorts to obscene school yard name-calling in a fight. (See also Trump’s recent claims that he’ll going to sue Cruz for just about everything.) The South Carolina primary revealed some other cracks in the Trump facade. He didn’t look like a happy warrior when he kept saying Rubio “sweats” too much to be effective or when he went full Daily Kos against Jeb and embraced the “Bush lied, people died” mantra. Instead, he looked feral and unstable. Trump’s South Carolina performance made for dynamic reality TV, but an American president is real life. Angry hysteria will be a problem in the Situation Room during a crisis or when engaged in delicate debates with foreign leaders. If you believe, as John Podhoretz does, that Trump went beyond the pale in South Carolina, you need to think about his future performance as president. Conclusion. The Trump who burst onto the political scene in 2015 was a breath of fresh air. He blew apart the Leftist shibboleths that stifle political debate in America. He spoke truth about our porous border, about Hillary’s misogyny, about Muslim terrorism and immigration, and about myriad othyer problems with Obama’s policies at home and abroad. He presented himself as a successful problem-solver, a dynamo unfettered by political correctness, and a clean slate uncorrupted by political dealings. No wonder conservatives who were long ago abandoned by the Republican political machine flocked to his banner. It’s become clear that Donald Trump has been lying to frustrated conservatives. Politically, he’s almost indistinguishable from Hillary Clinton, the friend he supported for so many years. He wants socialized medicine, he thinks “Bush lied, people died,” he approves of taxpayer support for Planned Parenthood, he likes turning the Middle East over to Vladimir Putin, he believes Israel is every bit as bad as the Iran-supported Muslims who seek her destruction, and he’s got a tin ear and a temper that do not bode well for a job as this nation’s chief executive officer. Dear Trump supporters: There was no shame in your offering him your support in 2015 when he appeared as a brave, fun, and energetic conservative. Now, though, there’s no shame in your backing away from that support in the face of new information showing he’s not the man you thought he was. Bookworm blogs at bookwormroom.com. People who pride themselves on rational thinking know there are few feelings worse than being wrong about something, especially something that they made a big noise about at the time. What helps lessen this intellectual humiliation is understanding that, given the information available at the time, the decision was a rational one at the time. The remedy for the initial error is to use the newly available information to reach a more reasoned decision. As the campaign season goes forward, we’re learning more about Donald Trump’s politics and seeing his initial ebullient puckishness too often give way to self-referential arrogance and venomous hubris. Now is a good time for Trump supporters to use this new information to revisit their original conclusion about him and to realize, with no shame attached, that he’s not the candidate they thought he was. When Trump first appeared on the 2015 political scene, he was a breath of fresh air. Most conservatives enjoyed his irreverence in tweaking the media rules favoring Progressives and demonizing conservatives -- rules before which Republicans had long bowed down. It was galvanizing to hear Trump state in plain English that we need to address the holes in immigration that allow Islamic terrorists easy entry, even if doing so meant temporarily stopping all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to separate the moderate wheat from the murderous chaff. Likewise, Hillary’s opponents enjoyed his refusal to allow Hillary’s double-X chromosomes to stifle the fact that the only woman Hillary supports is Hillary. To that end, she enabled her husband’s predatory, misogynistic sexual misbehavior for more than thirty years. Trump was the first Republican to remind everyone how appalling and hypocritical Hillary’s behavior has been. Early on, Trump was loud about conservative positions: Securing our borders; supporting Israel; ending the abortion culture, and protecting Second Amendment rights. It therefore seemed as if the dream conservative candidate was presenting himself. Here was a man who bulldozed the political correctness that stifles conservative thought and who openly, and in simple language, embraced conservative positions. Based upon that information, it was eminently reasonable to support Donald Trump. The media also encouraged Trump’s candidacy. He was good for ratings and they considered him un-electable. Given the media’s overwhelming progressive bias, they wanted to advance a Republican candidate they were sure would lose. They therefore gave him 25 times more coverage than the rest of the GOP field combined. That’s a lot of free advertising in a nation that appreciates colorful characters. For months, then, for someone bewildered by the exceptionally crowded Republican field, Trump seemed like the answer to seven years of Obama’s efforts to turn America into another saggy, flabby semi-socialist country; to hand the Middle East over to Putin; and to tear down our national security by destroying America’s borders and having our military focus obsessively on climate change and social re-engineering. That was then. This is now. Now the opposition research is finally coming to light, and it seems that Trump (shame on him, not shame on you) has been lying to America’s conservatives. Up until he threw himself into this election cycle, Trump was the very model of a modern elite Progressive. Moreover, as the campaign progresses, his current statements give the lie to his past promises. Specifically: Trump on party affiliation: Trump changes political parties like Will Smith’s son changes clothes -- with frequent regularity and without any coherent belief system driving his decisions. When it comes to an ideological home, Trump has never demonstrated fixed principles. In a present, fixed principles are nice. Trump on political donations: For decades Trump has donated to both Democrats and Republicans. In 2006, he donated heavily to Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, helping them retake Congress from the Republicans. Over the years, even when donating to both Democrats and Republicans, Democrats got the larger share of the wealth. Some say that, as a wise businessman, Trump needed to keep both parties happy -- an argument that ignores the fact that his donations skewed Left over the years. However, when you’re voting for president, wouldn’t you prefer someone who was guided over the years at least a little bit by principle, not just profit? As a conservative, would you ever, under any circumstances, donate to Nancy Pelosi? If you answer “no” to that question, you need to ask yourself why you’re forgiving the same conduct in Donald Trump. Trump on socialized medicine: Conservatives don’t like socialized medicine or semi-socialized Obamacare. Why? Because: (1) The only way government can control costs is to ration care -- which is why old people in England are so often put on death pathways. (2) Without market competition, medical care providers can get away with murderously bad behavior. The VA, which traps veterans in a socialist medical hell, is a perfect example. (3) The preeminent WHO study Leftists cite to disparage the American system was a con, having as its highest metric the fact that a medical system is socialized, and giving scant attention to actual outcomes. (4) The data used to compare American outcomes to those in other nations is often apples versus oranges, falsely disparaging American care. (5) Conservatives know that, in medicine, as in all other aspects of the economy, the free market is the surest way to achieve the best product at the lowest prices, something as true for buying medical insurance as it is for buying medical care. But what does Donald Trump believe? According to a recent interview, it turns out that Trump supports fully socialized medicine, with the government as the only paying customer (using dollars it forcibly extracts from taxpayers, of course) I am going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now. [snip] I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. [snip] The government’s gonna pay for it. Please realize that what Trump is advocating is an even purer from of socialized medicine than Obamacare. The latter at least clings to a pretense of the free market insofar as it still allows insurance (even though insurers are forced to provide government-controlled insurance and consumers are forced to buy that insurance or go without). Trump’s dream, however, is as pure as Britain’s National Health Service, where everyone sees a doctor for free, but the care is abysmal those deemed too expensive to care for (the old and very sick) are left to die. Trump on eminent domain for crony benefit: If you’ve heard the phrase “eminent domain” tossed about a bit regarding Trump, but aren’t quite sure what it is, here’s a quick primer: The Fifth Amendment allows government to forcibly purchase private property for a fair price if that purchase is for the public good (e.g., roads or reservoirs). The Supreme Court, in Kelo v. City of New London, fundamentally changed traditional eminent domain principles by removing the public good from the equation. Kelo held that government can force the sale of private property to another individual citizen (usually a large developer) for the latter’s financial benefit. The standard is no longer the public good, but the possibly that a development might increase tax revenue. A decision that allows government coercion in the service of cronyism is as bad as it gets. Trump, however, liked crony-based eminent domain. The only thing that stopped Trump in the 1990s from using government force to seize a widow’s home so that he could build a parking lot was a pre-Kelo court decision holding that government could not use eminent domain to benefit one of its cronies. Trump currently professes to value eminent domain only in its purest, constitutional form. Trump’s history, though, which he hasn’t disavowed, shows that he has no compunction about using government force as his private economic army. Trump on the Iraq War: During the South Carolina debate, Trump savagely attacked Jeb Bush by claiming that George W. Bush lied to get America into war. Trump added that, with his usual acumen, he always knew that the Iraq War would be a disaster. Given South Carolina’s support for Dubya, Trump showed a disturbing intemperance in attacking him. Conservatives may argue about the wisdom of the Iraq War, but they don’t believe Bush lied. They believe instead that he made his decision on the best information available at the time. Whatever else Bush was, he wasn’t a liar. The lead Republican candidate shouldn’t sound like a Daily Kos blogger. Trump’s alleged insights and long-standing anti-war stance are also untrue. Trump believed as early as 2000 that Iraq was working to get WMDs. Moreover, in the critical time from 2001-2004, there’s no evidence that Trump ever said a word about the wisdom of going into Iraq. Trump lied on that South Carolina stage and he slandered a good man, as well as all the people who supported that good man. During a recent press conference, Trump made a profoundly ignorant statement about pre-War Iraq. He praised Saddam Hussein. Iraq today, says Trump, Iraq a “Harvard for terrorism,” not because Obama’s premature withdrawal created a vacuum into which terrorism flowed, but because before the war “Saddam Hussein understood and he killed terrorists.” Wow. Just wow. Aside from giving the anti-War Left and Barack Obama a complete pass, that’s just historically wrong. The reality is that Saddam Hussein, in addition to using genocidal terrorism against Iraqi Kurds, and generally terrorizing his own people, routinely funded and sheltered terrorists. In the face of this newly revealed re-write of his own personal history and ignorance about Iraq, is Trump really ready to lead America on foreign policy? Trump on Israel. Politically-conservative Jews, some of whom I know well and respect greatly, flocked to Trump because, when he first hit the campaign trail, he was unabashed in his support for Israel. He forcefully criticized Obama’s approach to Israel, and recognized that Obama’s agreement with Iran sold Israel down the river. His open support for Israel, combined with his recognition that Islam is a threat to the West, made him an appealing candidate for people tired of RINOs who did little to stop Obama. Recently, though, Trump has backed down from supporting Israel. He now insists that he’ll be “neutral” about the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Neutrality, of course, implies that he finds each side’s position reasonable, and therefore cannot take sides. Those who support Israel do not agree with this moral relativism. On the one hand, you have a liberal democracy that extends full civil rights to all of its citizens, that opens its religious sites to all comers, and that has repeatedly traded land (and prisoners) for peace. That would be Israel, a dynamic, life-oriented, pro-capitalist nation that has long been a friend to America. On the other hand, you have a totalitarian theocracy that wants a blood purge of the M iddle East, making it judenrein; that is misogynistic, homophobic, anti-American, anti-Christian; that uses peace initiatives as an opportunity to expand its killing abilities; that hides behind civilians during war; and that recently has been encouraging its young people to stab to death as many Israeli citizens as possible. And between these two parties, Trump now professes neutrality? I don’t think so. In addition to moral relativism, Trump’s recent statements reveal him to be all over the board when it comes to whether a deal can be brokered (probably not except he can probably do it) and who’s really at fault in the Middle East (they’re both bad but Israel maybe isn’t trying). If you support Israel, shouldn’t this new information change your belief that Trump will support the only liberal democracy in the Middle East? Trump on Planned Parenthood: Donald Trump has claimed since 2011 that he is pro-Life. Fair enough, even if his pro-Life views are rather strange. What’s disturbing is that Trump still supports Planned Parenthood. In 2011 alone, Planned Parenthood aborted 333,964 babies, with special emphasis on aborting minority babies (something that would have made Margaret Sanger proud). Whether they’re pro-Life or not, conservatives understand that it’s wrong for American taxpayers to provide 45% of Planned Parenthood’s funding. If the issue really is “women’s health,” there are many other women’s health clinics that provide comprehensive healthcare short of abortion. Planned Parenthood’s insistence that it doesn’t use federal dollars to pay for abortions is meaningless. Money is fungible, after all, and the dollars it doesn’t have to spend on paying for utilities, supplies, and staff, can go to abortion services. For the financially-savvy Trump, who understands money’s fungibility, to continue to support Planned Parenthood makes no sense. Trump on Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton is Donald Trump’s opponent in this race, and we can be sure that he will rip her to shreds (although he’s currently more interested in shredding Republican candidates, a circular firing squad approach to the primaries that is terribly damaging to the conservative brand). In the past, though, Trump thought highly of Hillary. When Trump married his current wife, in 2005, the Clintons attended. Seven years later, in 2012, he was raving about the wonders of Hillary: Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman. I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard. Trump also admired Hillary as Secretary of State: “I think she really works hard and I think she does a good job. I like her.” Admittedly, Hillary has moved to the Left recently in a bizarre attempt to outflank Communist Bernie Sanders, but she’s was in 2005 and 2012 pretty much what she’s always been and still is now: A woman who’s used men and trampled on other women to achieve her political rise; an ideologue who dotes on her vision of Big Government; a compulsive liar; and someone who seems drawn to corruption like a moth to a flame. If Trump can’t explain the reason he’s turned on Hillary, other than his personal ambition to get to the White House, it’s reasonable to believe that Trump’s current attacks on Hillary are merely to assuage his new conservative base and have nothing to do with his core faith in her. Trump on overseas labor: Trump shot to fame on the subject of immigration. His first line of attack was against the Muslims the Obama administration wants to admit, even though the administration concedes it current cannot vet incoming immigrants for terrorist ties. Having succeeded with this stance, Trump expanded the immigration debate to say that he intends to stop illegal immigration altogether by building a wall and forcing Mexico to pay for it. Many conservatives agree with Trump’s willingness to speak bluntly on the issue of illegal immigration. A sovereign state must have control over its borders; otherwise, it’s Rome when the barbarians overwhelmed it, first by unlimited immigration, then by force of arms. Except. . . . Except that it appears that Trump’s anti-immigrant stance doesn’t extend to protecting American workers. Trump talks about immigrants taking American jobs or, worse, having American jobs shipped right out of the country, but Trump’s business practices don’t support his words. Trump’s line of clothing is manufactured overseas and has been for a long time. Moreover, Trump has been lying about this for a long time too, telling everyone he doesn’t ship jobs overseas when, in fact, he does. Character matters. The whole overseas labor issue does not reflect well on Trump’s character. Trump on Putin: Conservatives have been concerned that Barack Obama has welcomed Vladimir Putin as a Middle Eastern savior. Starting with Syria, Obama basically turned the Middle East over to Putin who is using his new status there, along with the cozy relationship he’s always had with Iran, to resurrect the Cold War glories of Russian world domination. What’s freaky is that Trump views Putin the same way -- as a great guy to work with, as someone who can get the job done in Syria, and as a potential ally. Really? Trump’s dishonesty. All politicians puff and shade the narrative. They are, after all, selling a product (themselves) and we accept that they’re going to heighten the good stuff and downplay the bad stuff. And then there’s Donald Trump. What was not obvious at the end of 2015, when Trump was gaining a foothold with fed-up conservatives is that Trump is a Hillaryesque liar. Take, for example, Trump’s bankruptcies. During the South Carolina debate, Trump denied ever filing for bankruptcy. In fact, Trump has filed for bankruptcy four different times to prop up his business. Trump’s claim that his campaign is entirely self-funded is also untrue. In fact, the majority of his campaign money comes from donors. Likewise, those donations Trump solicited for veterans, implying that they’d go directly to veteran’s causes, instead go into his personal foundation. And as noted above, Trump has consistently lied about his willingness to circumvent American labor for cheap overseas worker. Trump’s stability: When his run for the White House was still something of a lark, Trump’s pugnacious style was leavened with a bit of humor and cheer. He was his reality-TV self -- pushy, outspoken, but kind of goofy/funny. Recently, though Trump has become darker and meaner in his attacks on his opponents? It started with the spat with Megyn Kelly. If Trump wanted to make war with the media . . . well, whatever. Since then, though, Trump’s increasingly in your face, vicious, and often obscene or bizarre attacks on his primary opponents are becoming worrisome. Take, for example, Trump calling Cruz a “pussy.” This is silly because Cruz is disliked by Senate RINOs because he is willing to stand and fight. What’s more upsetting is that a candidate would use a sexual insult in a national forum. It’s worse than just tone, though. The bigger issue is whether we want as President someone who resorts to obscene school yard name-calling in a fight. (See also Trump’s recent claims that he’ll going to sue Cruz for just about everything.) The South Carolina primary revealed some other cracks in the Trump facade. He didn’t look like a happy warrior when he kept saying Rubio “sweats” too much to be effective or when he went full Daily Kos against Jeb and embraced the “Bush lied, people died” mantra. Instead, he looked feral and unstable. Trump’s South Carolina performance made for dynamic reality TV, but an American president is real life. Angry hysteria will be a problem in the Situation Room during a crisis or when engaged in delicate debates with foreign leaders. If you believe, as John Podhoretz does, that Trump went beyond the pale in South Carolina, you need to think about his future performance as president. Conclusion. The Trump who burst onto the political scene in 2015 was a breath of fresh air. He blew apart the Leftist shibboleths that stifle political debate in America. He spoke truth about our porous border, about Hillary’s misogyny, about Muslim terrorism and immigration, and about myriad othyer problems with Obama’s policies at home and abroad. He presented himself as a successful problem-solver, a dynamo unfettered by political correctness, and a clean slate uncorrupted by political dealings. No wonder conservatives who were long ago abandoned by the Republican political machine flocked to his banner. It’s become clear that Donald Trump has been lying to frustrated conservatives.

        "articles": "The Black Lives Matter movement began as a hashtag in July 2013 immediately after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Although the movement would be reinforced along the way by any number of lies -- “Hands up don’t shoot” comes quickly to mind -- not enough attention has been paid to the original lie, one that may eventually launch a thousand riots before it burns itself out, namely that Trayvon Martin was an innocent little boy. On the night of February 26, 2012, George Zimmerman shot and killed the seventeen-year-old Martin. For a week the story went nowhere until the attorneys representing Martin’s family reached out to Ryan Julison, an Orlando-based media strategist and the one white member of what was rapidly becoming Team Trayvon. Team leader, attorney Benjamin Crump, understood that the national media were suckers for a story with a racial angle, specifically one that featured a black victim of white injustice. If Zimmerman’s parents had named their son Jorge´ Zimmerman -- he was named after his Uncle Jorge´-- there might not have been a Black Lives Matter movement. After meeting with Crump, Julison immediately began pitching the Trayvon saga to the larger world. Reuters bit first. On March 7, just two days after Julison was contacted, Reuters posted an article headlined “Family of Florida boy killed by Neighborhood Watch seeks arrest.” The oversized opening sentence establishes a thesis that has proved irresistible to the major media for the last half century: “The family of a 17-year-old African-American boy shot to death last month in his gated Florida community by a white Neighborhood Watch captain wants to see the captain arrested.” Trayvon was a “good kid.” He hoped to be a pilot. He was carrying the soon to be iconic ice tea and Skittles, the latter for the “thirteen-year-old” son of Trayvon’s father’s girlfriend, now elevated to the role of Martin’s “brother.” Said Crump, “Trayvon only has skittles. He has the gun.\" On March 8, Current TV’s \"The Young Turks\" took up Trayvon’s cause. Co-host Ana Kasparian, an impressively self-righteous twenty-five at the time, made no fewer than a dozen errors in her five-minute presentation, including this whopper, “There was no self-defense in this situation.” As Kasparian envisioned the action, Zimmerman called 911 and said “there was someone in the gated community who looks very suspicious, i.e. a young black man who makes me uncomfortable.” Apparently to ease his discomfort, “George Zimmerman decides to go ahead and shoot the 17-year-old black boy in the chest which led to his death.” “Oh, my God,” gasped her co-host Cenk Uygur. “He just shot him?” “He just shot him,” affirmed Kasparian, who then pontificated, “I get so angry when people deny there is racism in this country.” In fact, Zimmerman, an Obama supporter, made about as unlikely a racist poster child as America could produce. He had most notably involved himself in a December 2010 incident in which a white police lieutenant’s son sucker punched a black homeless man named Sherman Ware outside a bar. Although Ware suffered a concussion, and there was video evidence of the punch, no action was taken for nearly a month. As Zimmerman would later relate, he and his wife Shellie printed fliers demanding that the community “hold accountable” officers responsible for misconduct. They then drove the fliers around to area churches and passed them out on a Sunday morning. As a result of the publicity, Police Chief Brian Tooley, whom Zimmerman blasted for his “illegal cover-up and corruption,” was forced to resign, and the lieutenant’s son was arrested. Zimmerman headlined his fliers with a famous quote from Anglo-Irish statesman Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” He might more accurately have quoted another Anglo-Irishman, Oscar Wilde, “No good deed goes unpunished.” In her book on the Zimmerman trial, Suspicion Nation, NBC’s Lisa Bloom does not mention this incident. Although at least one member of Team Trayvon worked with Zimmerman on the Ware case, the team chose to introduce him to the world as a thuggish white man, a loose cannon, an armed vigilante who preyed on undersized black children. To make this narrative work, Team Trayvon also had to scrub Martin’s background and package him as something that he was not, an innocent little boy. They would have remarkable success in doing both. On March 8, CBS’s \"Good Morning\" interviewed Trayvon’s father, Tracy Martin, and encouraged him to express his outrage that Zimmerman had not been arrested. Getting the biological parents in front of the cameras was at the heart of Julison’s strategy. No one dared challenge a parent who buried a child. On March 10, \"Good Morning America\" added a new wrinkle or two, but it only reinforced the narrative established by Team Trayvon. Trayvon was the unarmed teenager carrying Skittles. He had always wanted to be a pilot or a football player. The viewer saw him as a smiling innocent through a montage of pre-adolescent photos. For the first time, Tracy Martin and Trayvon’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, were interviewed together. Sybrina got the last word. “This clearly was murder. It was not an accident,” she cried, “and it hurts. It hurts as a mother.” Weeks before the shooting, Fulton had thrown Trayvon out of the house for fighting. There is a time-honored standard in America’s newsrooms to use the most recent photo. The media across the spectrum ignored this. On March 28, for instance, People Magazine ran a cover story titled “An American Tragedy” and subtitled “Heartbreaking New Details.” There, staring out from the magazine racks on just about every supermarket aisle in America, was a clean-cut Trayvon, age about thirteen. Those who read no deeper than the cover learned that the death of this “unarmed” lad left “a family devastated and a country outraged.” Zimmerman met an entirely different Trayvon Martin on the night of February 26. His Trayvon towered over Zimmerman. In fact, his Trayvon was roughly the same height and weight as legendary boxer Tommy “The Hitman” Hearns. His Trayvon was into street fighting, drugs, guns, burglary, and mixed martial arts. The one good eyewitness confirmed this within a half-hour of the shooting. He told the Sanford police he saw a “black man in a black hoodie on top of either a white guy... or an Hispanic guy in a red sweater on the ground yelling out help.” According to this witness, the black man on top was “throwing down blows on the guy MMA style.” In her book, NBC’s Bloom made no mention of this key witness’s testimony, not even at the trial. On March 23, four weeks after the shooting, Barack Obama addressed the nation. By this time, the White House had access to all the information the Sanford Police Department did. The courageous step for Obama would have been to defend the police and to demand an end to the media lynching of Zimmerman. As an African American, he had more latitude to do this than a white politician would have. If Obama had called attention to the painful fractures in Martin’s domestic life, his suppressed criminal record, his all but unseen descent into drugs and violence, and especially his reckless attack on Zimmerman, Obama could have sent a powerful message to black America. But he did not. He went with the lie. Said Obama for the ages, “My main message is to the parents of Trayvon -- If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.” With the police intimidated into inaction, kids like Trayvon have been dying ever since. The Black Lives Matter movement began as a hashtag in July 2013 immediately after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Although the movement would be reinforced along the way by any number of lies -- “Hands up don’t shoot” comes quickly to mind -- not enough attention has been paid to the original lie, one that may eventually launch a thousand riots before it burns itself out, namely that Trayvon Martin was an innocent little boy.

It was not an accident,” she cried, “and it hurts. It hurts as a mother.” Weeks before the shooting, Fulton had thrown Trayvon out of the house for fighting. There is a time-honored standard in America’s newsrooms to use the most recent photo. The media across the spectrum ignored this. On March 28, for instance, People Magazine ran a cover story titled “An American Tragedy” and subtitled “Heartbreaking New Details.” There, staring out from the magazine racks on just about every supermarket aisle in America, was a clean-cut Trayvon, age about thirteen. Those who read no deeper than the cover learned that the death of this “unarmed” lad left “a family devastated and a country outraged.” Zimmerman met an entirely different Trayvon Martin on the night of February 26. His Trayvon towered over Zimmerman. In fact, his Trayvon was roughly the same height and weight as legendary boxer Tommy “The Hitman” Hearns. His Trayvon was into street fighting, drugs, guns, burglary, and mixed martial arts. The one good eyewitness confirmed this within a half-hour of the shooting. He told the Sanford police he saw a “black man in a black hoodie on top of either a white guy... or an Hispanic guy in a red sweater on the ground yelling out help.” According to this witness, the black man on top was “throwing down blows on the guy MMA style.” In her book, NBC’s Bloom made no mention of this key witness’s testimony, not even at the trial. On March 23, four weeks after the shooting, Barack Obama addressed the nation. By this time, the White House had access to all the information the Sanford Police Department did. The courageous step for Obama would have been to defend the police and to demand an end to the media lynching of Zimmerman. As an African American, he had more latitude to do this than a white politician would have. If Obama had called attention to the painful fractures in Martin’s domestic life, his suppressed criminal record, his all but unseen descent into drugs and violence, and especially his reckless attack on Zimmerman, Obama could have sent a powerful message to black America. But he did not. He went with the lie. Said Obama for the ages, “My main message is to the parents of Trayvon -- If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.” With the police intimidated into inaction, kids like Trayvon have been dying ever since.",

        "articles": "Harry Reid's ham-fisted action to curb the filibuster of presidential appointment creates an enormous political opportunity for Republicans in 2014. As more than one pundit has noted, ending the filibuster for nominations means that a Senate Republican majority can end the filibuster for legislation as well, and Reid has removed the political cover for Democrats who would have used the filibuster to block Republican initiatives. What we have today bears remarkable similarities to the Republican tidal wave twenty years ago, in 1994. Newt Gingrich and other House Republicans tested with polling data the most telling weaknesses of Democrats on policy issues, and from that, they produced the \"Contract With America.\" The Contract was emphatically not a promise that Republicans would be able to pass into law (or into constitutional amendment) the ten items on the list. What Gingrich rather promised was that if Republicans ran the House of Representatives, they would bring each of the ten items up for a vote in the House within the first 100 days of the Congress. House Republicans did everything promised, and did it ahead of schedule. Until 1994, House Democrat leadership provided members of their caucus with cover by simply not bringing politically popular conservative measures before the House for a vote. Bills that the Democrat leadership did not want members to have to vote on were simply dumped into the Rules Committee or never heard in the committee assigned the bill. In the Senate, any party that had at least forty-one stalwart votes could prevent a measure from coming before the Senate, and, as in the House, the party that controlled the Senate and its committees could also prevent any bill from being voted on by the Senate. Reid has changed that for good. If Republicans gain six seats in the Senate, then they can amend the rule on cloture for legislation, and the new Republican leadership can call up any bill for a roll call vote to nail each senator's hide on a clear record. Because it is highly likely that Republicans will have an even larger House majority after 2014, this means that something like a Contract With America, only this time proposed by Senate Republicans, can tell America that within 100 days of taking power, the new Republican Senate leadership will call up for vote a number of items, and the House can promise to swiftly pass the bills and send these to the Senate well before that date. What items should be in the new Contract? Each should be very popular and very easy to understand. Repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a bill that allows people to keep their own health insurance plan is one thought. Allowing interstate competition for health insurance is another idea. Enacting tort reform for medical lawsuits -- or maybe simply taxing all contingent fees above $1,000,0000 at a 95% tax rate? -- is another idea. Why not put into law that any health care plan for ordinary Americans must be the health care plan for all members of the federal government? Senate Republicans, when proclaiming their Contract, and promising that each item will come up for an up-or-down vote within 100 days of taking power, can also put Harry Reid in trouble right now. They can challenge him to do today what Republicans promise to do when they take power. They can ask Senate Democrats in red states facing voters in 2014 to support their efforts to bring these items up now -- confident that Reid and Senate Democrats will never allow such a vote while they have power. The problems for Democrats will get much worse in January 2015. Because of what Reid has done with the filibuster, the House can quickly pass those ten bills, and the Senate majority can then compel all Senate members to vote \"Yea\" or \"Nay\" on these ten items. Obama will, of course, veto all the measures, and then Democrats in both houses of Congress will have to go on record as voting to override Obama (and so defying their president and party leader), or else voting to support Obama's veto. These Democrats will have no good choices at all. Republicans will be able to address each issue Americans care about, and no filibuster will be able to prevent them from putting each Democrat in Congress on record. Obama's vetoes will make him increasingly look like a hapless president whose only approach to the problems our nation faces is to veto bills sent to him by Congress. That means that in 2016, Democrats will be on the defensive, with members of Congress in both houses trying to explain to voters why they supported Obama. And it will allow Republicans to make a compelling case as to why American needs a president who will sign reforms passed by a Republican Congress -- and reforms wanted by the American people.

Without ever attending a meeting, let alone a march, or even making a donation, they got to celebrate Obergefell v. Hodges as if it were V-J day. These are the same people, of course, who protested not a peep in 1996 when Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law, the same people who voted giddily for Barack Obama in 2008 despite his avowed support for traditional marriage, the same people who cannot wait until their next water cooler encounter to dress down some hapless co-worker as a “bigot.” Moral hauteur has never come so cheaply. So immune are our friends to history, they likely do not know who it is they have to thank for the accelerated transmutation of this highly unlikely idea into law. As I note in my forthcoming book, Scarlet Letters, if there were a Che Guevara in this movement, it was his hysterical homeboy, Perez Hilton. Born Mario Armando Lavandeira in Miami, Hilton had rechristened himself in homage to airhead celebrity Paris Hilton and gossiped his way to fame, if not fortune, through his supremely catty blog. Well before he turned thirty, Hilton emerged as what one gay rival called the media’s “bad-boy darling go-to gay.” A natural neo-puritan, Hilton prided himself on “outing” those celebrities who chose not to share their sexual inclinations with the world. In 2006, he had scored a media hit when he forced former Doogie Howser star Neil Patrick Harris to admit his homosexuality. “We are so proud (despite the nay-sayers) in having a hand in bringing about change,” Hilton boasted at the time. “We’ve said it before and we will say it again: the closet no longer exists if you are a celebrity or a politician!” The bully boy tactics of this self-styled “gossip gangsta” did not thrill everyone in the gay community. Many had problems with the ethics of forcing private individuals to reveal their sexuality. “What purpose does it serve?” asked gay comedy writer Bruce Vilanch. Hilton and other “gay people for a living” seemed to forget, said Vilanch, that most homosexuals had day jobs and did not appreciate having their privacy rights shredded. Writing in Salon, Japhy Grant believed the straight media cottoned to Hilton because he fulfilled the stereotype of “the bitchy gay man who has all the dish,” a homosexual equivalent of “Stepin Fetchit.” Grant missed Hilton’s real value: he was doing the neo-puritan’s dirty work in advancing the gay agenda. Hilton got his best chance to advance that agenda on April 19, 2009, Patriot’s Day. The site was Las Vegas. The occasion was the Miss USA pageant, at which Hilton held forth as a celebrity judge. “Next, let’s have California, Carrie Prejean,” said Billy Bush, host of the Miss USA 2009 pageant. The tall, twenty-one year-old blond strode nervously to the center stage. One of five finalists, she hoped to avoid the kind of embarrassment that befell many a would-be beauty queen on the Q & A portion of such contests. Prejean reached into the bowl of questions hoping to acquit herself well. In 2009, no celebrity judge in America save Hilton would have dared to ask the question that Prejean drew: “Vermont recently became the 4th state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think every state should follow suit. Why or why not?\" Indeed, just a few months before the 2008 election, Senator Barack Obama told California pastor Rick Warren, “I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it’s also a sacred union. God’s in the mix.” With Obama at the top of the ticket, black and Latino voters turned out in record numbers and helped pass Proposition 8 in California defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Hollywood was still fuming when Prejean answered Perez’s question innocently, if a bit awkwardly, “Well I think it’s great that Americans are able to choose one way or the other. We live in a land where you can choose same-sex marriage or opposite marriage. You know what, in my country, in my family, I think I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman, no offense to anybody out there. But that’s how I was raised and I believe that it should be between a man and a woman.” As soon as she gave her answer, Prejean could tell from the reaction of the judges, especially Perez, that this was not what they wanted to hear. “He looked absolutely devastated,” Prejean remembered. Although her answer mirrored the president’s on that same question, the judges were not hearing Barack Obama. They were hearing George Wallace. The fitting had already begun for Prejean’s Scarlet H. Firebrand Hilton took the lead. He reportedly gave Prejean a “zero” vote on her answer, which likely cost her the Miss USA crown. She would be judged first runner-up. “If that girl would have won Miss USA I would have gone up on stage, I sh** you not,” Hilton boasted on his blog, “and snatched that tiara off her head.” Hilton’s rants grew progressively more obscene because no one of consequence in his world objected. Hollywood’s anger was directed instead at Prejean. “A lot of people are mad at you,” her gay manager texted her in discouraging her from attending the coronation ball. “I’m afraid of what might happen to you. You really shouldn’t come.” He apologized not to Prejean for the invectives his allies hurled at her -- Nazi, bigot, b****, c*** -- but to Perez for Prejean’s answer. Her female coach meanwhile apologized to the sponsors. Over the next several months Prejean would suffer any number of insults and indignities culminating in the loss of her Miss California crown. The pretext for this anti-Christian tiara snatch was Prejean’s alleged failure to cooperate with the Miss California executives then scheming to take her crown away. After her bushwhacking at the Miss USA contest, the media dug into Prejean’s virtual dumpster almost as eagerly as they had dug into Sarah Palin’s literal one. They delighted in shocking themselves with the prurient tidbits they unearthed -- photos of her modeling lingerie, reports of a breast enhancement, a graphic home video. These were the kind of discoveries that usually advance an actress’s career, but not Prejean’s. Reporters saw in Prejean what the lions saw huddled before them in the Colosseum -- fresh Christian meat. The leaders of the other cults in the neo-puritan synod held their tongues. Nary a feminist anywhere protested the shameful, sexist treatment of Prejean. God was no longer so much “in the mix” that Obama saw fit to defend Prejean or chastise her persecutors. And, as always, the Muslims and their supporters laid low. The memo had been sent and received. There would be no negative consequences for defaming a Christian. The tumbrils were rolling. This past weekend has been heady one for our friends on the soft-core left. Without ever attending a meeting, let alone a march, or even making a donation, they got to celebrate Obergefell v. Hodges as if it were V-J day.

Writing in Salon, Japhy Grant believed the straight media cottoned to Hilton because he fulfilled the stereotype of “the bitchy gay man who has all the dish,” a homosexual equivalent of “Stepin Fetchit.” Grant missed Hilton’s real value: he was doing the neo-puritan’s dirty work in advancing the gay agenda. Hilton got his best chance to advance that agenda on April 19, 2009, Patriot’s Day. The site was Las Vegas. The occasion was the Miss USA pageant, at which Hilton held forth as a celebrity judge. “Next, let’s have California, Carrie Prejean,” said Billy Bush, host of the Miss USA 2009 pageant. The tall, twenty-one year-old blond strode nervously to the center stage. One of five finalists, she hoped to avoid the kind of embarrassment that befell many a would-be beauty queen on the Q & A portion of such contests. Prejean reached into the bowl of questions hoping to acquit herself well. In 2009, no celebrity judge in America save Hilton would have dared to ask the question that Prejean drew: “Vermont recently became the 4th state to legalize same-sex marriage. Do you think every state should follow suit. Why or why not?\" Indeed, just a few months before the 2008 election, Senator Barack Obama told California pastor Rick Warren, “I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it’s also a sacred union. God’s in the mix.” With Obama at the top of the ticket, black and Latino voters turned out in record numbers and helped pass Proposition 8 in California defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Hollywood was still fuming when Prejean answered Perez’s question innocently, if a bit awkwardly, “Well I think it’s great that Americans are able to choose one way or the other. We live in a land where you can choose same-sex marriage or opposite marriage. You know what, in my country, in my family, I think I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman, no offense to anybody out there. But that’s how I was raised and I believe that it should be between a man and a woman.” As soon as she gave her answer, Prejean could tell from the reaction of the judges, especially Perez, that this was not what they wanted to hear. “He looked absolutely devastated,” Prejean remembered. Although her answer mirrored the president’s on that same question, the judges were not hearing Barack Obama. They were hearing George Wallace. The fitting had already begun for Prejean’s Scarlet H. Firebrand Hilton took the lead. He reportedly gave Prejean a “zero” vote on her answer, which likely cost her the Miss USA crown. She would be judged first runner-up. “If that girl would have won Miss USA I would have gone up on stage, I sh** you not,” Hilton boasted on his blog, “and snatched that tiara off her head.” Hilton’s rants grew progressively more obscene because no one of consequence in his world objected. Hollywood’s anger was directed instead at Prejean. “A lot of people are mad at you,” her gay manager texted her in discouraging her from attending the coronation ball. “I’m afraid of what might happen to you. You really shouldn’t come.” He apologized not to Prejean for the invectives his allies hurled at her -- Nazi, bigot, b****, c*** -- but to Perez for Prejean’s answer. Her female coach meanwhile apologized to the sponsors. Over the next several months Prejean would suffer any number of insults and indignities culminating in the loss of her Miss California crown. The pretext for this anti-Christian tiara snatch was Prejean’s alleged failure to cooperate with the Miss California executives then scheming to take her crown away. After her bushwhacking at the Miss USA contest, the media dug into Prejean’s virtual dumpster almost as eagerly as they had dug into Sarah Palin’s literal one. They delighted in shocking themselves with the prurient tidbits they unearthed -- photos of her modeling lingerie, reports of a breast enhancement, a graphic home video. These were the kind of discoveries that usually advance an actress’s career, but not Prejean’s. Reporters saw in Prejean what the lions saw huddled before them in the Colosseum -- fresh Christian meat. The leaders of the other cults in the neo-puritan synod held their tongues. Nary a feminist anywhere protested the shameful, sexist treatment of Prejean. God was no longer so much “in the mix” that Obama saw fit to defend Prejean or chastise her persecutors. And, as always, the Muslims and their supporters laid low. The memo had been sent and received. There would be no negative consequences for defaming a Christian. The tumbrils were rolling.",

        "articles": "Obamacare insurance companies are asking for rate increases up to 50% or more, and the reason is predictable: new customers are sicker than they originally thought. New York Times: Health insurance companies around the country are seeking rate increases of 20 percent to 40 percent or more, saying their new customers under the Affordable Care Act turned out to be sicker than expected. Federal officials say they are determined to see that the requests are scaled back. Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans — market leaders in many states — are seeking rate increases that average 23 percent in Illinois, 25 percent in North Carolina, 31 percent in Oklahoma, 36 percent in Tennessee and 54 percent in Minnesota, according to documents posted online by the federal government and state insurance commissioners and interviews with insurance executives. The Oregon insurance commissioner, Laura N. Cali, has just approved 2016 rate increases for companies that cover more than 220,000 people. Moda Health Plan, which has the largest enrollment in the state, received a 25 percent increase, and the second-largest plan, LifeWise, received a 33 percent increase. Jesse Ellis O’Brien, a health advocate at the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group, said: “Rate increases will be bigger in 2016 than they have been for years and years and will have a profound effect on consumers here. Some may start wondering if insurance is affordable or if it’s worth the money.” President Obama, on a trip to Tennessee this week, said that consumers should put pressure on state insurance regulators to scrutinize the proposed rate increases. If commissioners do their job and actively review rates, he said, “my expectation is that they’ll come in significantly lower than what’s being requested.” The rate requests, from some of the more popular health plans, suggest that insurance markets are still adjusting to shock waves set off by the Affordable Care Act. It is far from certain how many of the rate increases will hold up on review, or how much they might change. But already the proposals, buttressed with reams of actuarial data, are fueling fierce debate about the effectiveness of the health law. It's not likely that states, who set the insurance rates, will allow companies the increases they say they need to remain viable. This may precipitate a mass exodus by insurance companies from Obamacare, putting the program in a death spiral. For the first two years of the program, companies promised the government that they would keep increases to a minimum. Now that the actuarial reality is setting in, not even money from the Obamacare slush fund that reimburses companies for their losses is enough to make them a profit. As Laszewski explains, Obamacare contains a “Reinsurance Program that caps big claim costs for insurers (individual plans only).” He writes that “in 2014, 80% of individual costs between $45,000 and $250,000 are paid by the government [read: by taxpayers], for example.” In other words, insurance purchased through Obamacare’s government-run exchanges isn’t even full-fledged private insurance; rather, it’s a sort of private-public hybrid. Private insurance companies pay for costs below $45,000, then taxpayers generously pick up the tab—a tab that their president hasn’t ever bothered to tell them he has opened up on their behalf—for four-fifths of the next $200,000-plus worth of costs. In this way, and so many others, Obamacare takes a major step toward the government monopoly over American medicine (“single payer”) that liberals drool about in their sleep. Laszewski adds, “The reinsurance program has done and will continue to do what it was intended to do; help attract and keep more carriers in Obamacare than might have otherwise come.” Thus, Obamacare is being aided by having taxpayers subsidize big insurance companies’ business expenses. (Who could ever have guessed that big government and big business might be natural allies?) But, amazingly, it doesn’t stop there. Laszewski writes that Obamacare also contains a “Risk Corridor Program that limits overall losses for insurers.” So insurers not only don’t have to pay out all of their costs; they also don’t have to swallow all of their losses. A 20% increase in my policy would mean more than $100 out of my pocket every month. No wonder consumers will be weighing whether it will be cheaper to pay the fine and go without insurance, or pony up for what's bound to be several years of massive rate increases. The mandate has failed miserably to bring in healthy young people to offset older, sicker Americans who actually need insurance. Do you think we're going to find out how many people are dropping their insurance instead of renewing? Sorry, that's classified.

But numbers from the New York Times and ten stories from good ol' Colin this year documenting hundreds of black mass shootings did not do much to remove the blinders of those who insist mass shootings are a white thing. \"Here's a fact that republicans are too stupid to grasp,\" said Mark K (@MarkRK47) on Twitter. \"Every mass shooting in the US is carried out by a white supremacist. Every. Single. One.\" Sibel Edmonds (@SibelEdmonds) chimed in to at least admit the possibility that not all mass shooters are white: \"One hard hitting fact: In the chronic USA mass shooting incidents, in 99+% of the cases, the perpetrators: White, Anglo-Saxon, Christian, Americans.\" Salon, the Daily Beast, Mother Jones, and other staples of the mass media cannot spread these fairy tales fast enough. The facts tell a different story — the opposite story. Anyone up for a magical mystery tour of mass shootings over the last two weeks where black people shot three or more people?

        "articles": "Freedom from religion was not what those who fled the oppression and persecution of European monarchies sought and not what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they wrote the Constitution. Yet the Freedom of Religion Foundation seeks to impose its values and restrict the free exercise of religion guaranteed in the First Amendment. Its latest targets are high school football camps in Arkansas, where, presumably, you are allowed take a knee to protest our racist flag but cannot take a knee in thanks to the Creator the Declaration of Independence notes endowed us with our unalienable rights: It's not just illegal for public schools to host pre or postgame prayer sessions. They can't do it at summer football camps, either. At least that's the stance of the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF), which has sent a letter to the Danville (Ark.) Public School District citing a Constitutional violation related to the comments made to high school football campers by a local pastor named Konnor McKay. The FFRF letter, which you can see here, insists that Danville, \"not allow its football program to be used as a captive audience for evangelists.\" That came in response to this social media post by McKay himself, celebrating his speech to a group of high school football players at Waldron High School. In the ongoing struggle for religious liberty, constitutional conservatives like to say the Constitution was written by those fleeing from religious persecution and that the First Amendment guaranteed freedom of religion and not freedom from it. The FFRF begs to differ. One of the atheist group's recent targets were the athletes at West Branch High School in Beloit, Ohio who liked to gather in prayer at their games: A southern Mahoning County school district is no longer saying a prayer before sporting events. The school's superintendent says it all stemmed from a local complaint that got a national organization involved. West Branch Superintendent Tim Saxton said he received a complaint letter from The Freedom From Religion Foundation, an anti-Christian organization, based out of Madison, Wisconsin. The letter claimed a prayer performed at a public school sporting event violates the constitution and does not provide for a separation between church and state. The FFRF is on a crusade to expunge religious expression from the public square, and the group gets the meaning of \"separation of church and state,\" a phrase that appears nowhere in the Constitution, all wrong. This isn't the first time its target has been high school football. The FFRF went ballistic not long ago over the baptism of an on-the-field high school football coach in Villa Rica, Georgia. Attendance was voluntary, and the students who attended did so on their own time and of their own free will. When the FFRF saw a video of the ceremony, it fired off a letter of righteous indignation to the Carroll County School superintendent: \"It is illegal for coaches to participate in religious activities with students, including prayer and baptisms,\" attorney Elizabeth Cavell wrote. \"Nor can coaches allow religious leaders to gain unique access to students during school-sponsored activities.\" They called the full emersion [sic] baptisms an \"egregious constitutional violation.\" ... \"I believe we live in a free country,\" the pastor said. \"These people that are trying to say you can't do that – well – they're taking away freedom. When did it become illegal to bow your head and pray? When did it become illegal to say I'm a Christian?\" Indeed, one would think publicly baptizing a high school football coach, rather than threatening the constitutional foundations of our democracy, is covered under the \"free exercise thereof\" clause in the First Amendment. The irony here is that the FFRF on its website touts itself as \"the largest free thought association in North America.\" It seems it depends on what you're thinking about to these thought police. Expressions of religion in sports are not uncommon, from the baseball pitcher pointing heavenward after a big strikeout to the singing of \"God Bless America\" in the 7th inning of baseball games after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Such expressions of religious liberty guaranteed by the Constitution are not always well received by those seeking to expunge all expressions of religious belief from the public square. NFL quarterback Tim Tebow believed, as was written in the Declaration of Independence, that we are endowed, not by government, but by our Creator, with inalienable rights. Tebow believed that his talents and opportunities, as well as his rights, come from that Creator, and for that, he was roundly mocked by his secular critics. A lawsuit filed on December 27, 2012 by the FFRF concerned sermons considered by the political left political speech by tax-exempt organization in alleged violation of federal law. These sermons, which can contain commentary on issues of the day in a religious context, are considered electioneering by the atheist left. The FFRF sought enforcement by the IRS of the 1954 Johnson Amendment, which states that tax-exempt groups, including churches, are not allowed to endorse political candidates. But the FFRF stretches that law to interpret churches taking positions from the pulpit in opposition to, say, the redefinition of marriage or the Obanacare mandates on providing contraceptive coverage as support for political candidates, albeit unnamed, who might share that opposition. The FFRF even asked the IRS to monitor and regulate religious speech. Investor's Business Daily, in a biting July 31, 2014 editorial, ripped apart the FFRF's faulty logic: But is the Catholic Church \"politicking\" when it proclaims its \"Fortnight for Freedom\" dedicated to opposing ObamaCare's contraceptive mandate and the government's forcing schools and charities it considers an extension of its faith to include it in insurance coverage or face crippling fines? Are Protestant and evangelical churches \"politicking\" when they participate in \"Pulpit Freedom Sunday\" this year on Oct. 5 to encourage congregations to \"vote their faith,\" which they consider to be an exercise of free speech and freedom of religion? The FFRF says that such events at \"rogue churches\" have \"become an annual occasion for churches to violate the law with impunity.\" But doesn't the Constitution say that Congress can make no such laws? The Constitution if fact guarantees freedom of religion, not freedom from it. Thomas Jefferson, source for the \"separation of church and state\" phrase often invoked by liberals, also said, \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against any form of tyranny over the mind of man.\" That should apply to those who speak their mind from the pulpit or on a high school football field as well. As Investor's Business Daily editorialized, those opposed to the free expression of religion and free speech get the establishment clause and church and state thing all wrong: The phrase \"separation of church and state\" in fact appears nowhere in the Constitution but in a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1802 to a group of Danbury Baptists assuring them that the First Amendment prohibited Congress from establishing a national church, such as the Church of England. Imposing political correctness upon the Tim Tebows of the world is tyranny. Thomas Jefferson feared what the British Crown tried to do: impose a state church on all the American people. The fact is that in Jefferson's time, the state and the church were inextricably linked. The Founding Fathers did fear the possible establishment of a national church like the Church of England, and to prevent it, they wrote the First Amendment to say \"Congress\" shall make no laws regarding the establishment of religion, meaning any particular religion. But it says nothing about the states, and it also says Congress shall make no laws restricting the free exercise thereof. Anyone who wants to know what the Founding Fathers intended with their words should analyze their actions. As Yale's Prof. Jon Butler writes: [T]he 1780 Massachusetts constitution authorized 'towns, parishes, precincts and other bodies politic to levy taxes 'for the institution of public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance of public Protestant teachers of piety, religion and morality.' ... Connecticut and New Hampshire had similar laws. Virginia, on the other hand, moved rapidly after the Revolutionary War to disestablish the Anglican church and separate the state from formal religious institutions. Curiously, no framer of the Constitution ever declared that Massachusetts, with its state-supported religious education, or Virginia, with its official secularism, were guilty of violating the 1st Amendment or any other fundamental constitutional principle. The Constitution mandates government's neutrality to religion, but its alleged desire to avoid any endorsement of religion has mutated into an unmistakable hostility. Perhaps the most egregious example occurred in April 1995, when the Murrah Federal Building was bombed and attorneys for the Clinton administration were ready to deny churches the same disaster assistance that every other building with collateral damage received because of the alleged separation of church and state. It took special congressional action to prevent this absurdity. I don't think this is what Thomas Jefferson had in mind. We have drifted a long way from the Founding Fathers' clear intent about the relationship between the free exercise of religion and government. People are no longer free to apply their religious beliefs to their businesses, as the vendetta against Hobby Lobby demonstrates. The Obama administration went to court to force the Little Sisters of the Poor to provide contraceptive coverage to their workers. Bakers were forced to bake cakes for same-sex ceremonies in violation of their religious beliefs. As the late Francis Cardinal George of Chicago, former head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, once observed, President Obama's idea of religious liberty, an idea shared by many liberals, differs little from Josef Stalin's: \"Freedom of worship was guaranteed in the Constitution of the former Soviet Union,\" Chicago's Francis Cardinal George recently wrote. \"You could go to church, if you could find one. The church, however, could do nothing except conduct religious rites in places of worship – no schools, religious publications, health care institutions, organized charity, ministry for justice and works of mercy that flow naturally from a living faith. We fought a long Cold War to defeat that vision of society.\" Indeed, we did. Our country was founded by those seeking freedom of religion and the free speech and free exercise that come with it. Forgive those who think otherwise, including the FFRF, for they know not what they do.

        "articles": "Contrary to assertions by useful idiots like Robert Reich that the Berkeley riots were the work of paramilitary right-wingers, it has become increasingly evident that black-clad Antifa anarchists coordinated with Bay Area community activists and UC Berkeley student groups to orchestrate the violent protests against Milo Yiannapolous. The Antifa rioters are the same mask-wearing, black-outfitted, Molotov cocktail-throwing, fire-burning, stick-carrying pugilist punks featured in The Occupation Manifesto and The Occupation Devolution videos chronicling Occupy Oakland in 2011. Although some of us sounded the alarm, too few paid attention. Antifa is short for “anti-fascist” and is pronounced an-TEE-fah. According to left-leaning tech magazine Wired, they are “militant anti-fascist[s]” and “anarchists prone to property destruction and online abuse.they double down on political polarization, driving the national narrative even further from center.” For a deeper explanation into its historical roots, see The Washington Post, Wired Magazine, and USA Today. Antifa is believed to have been born in 1970s Germany -- a far left, communist, anti-fascist reaction to far right, neo-Nazi fascist groups ascendant at the time. It spread throughout Europe and found its way to the US where it seems to have first appeared at the WTO riots in Seattle. Like a bad rash, they keep popping up, having been actively engaged in the Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and anti-Trump movements. Like ISIS, independent “cells” exist all over the world. They are incredibly well-networked, trained in effective paramilitary tactics, and have a nuanced and sophisticated understanding, use and manipulation of the internet -- especially trolling, DDoS attacks, and their Bash the Fash and Meme Wars with the fascist alt-right. They are known for employing “Black Bloc” tactics at protests to achieve their ends -- forming a monolithic bloc by dressing in black and wearing black balaclavas or bandanas so as not to be identified by facial recognition software or cameras. According to the Washington Post, the hordes move in unison as one large, black-clad unidentifiable mass to “achieve both violent and nonviolent ends.” By putting on our masks we reveal our unity; and by raising our voices in the street together, we speak our anger at the facelessness of power,” reads a popular anarchist credo that was printed on the inside of masks distributed at a violent anti-capitalist protest in London in 1999. They carry thick poles to threaten, menace, and maim. According to USA Today: In a 2015 article published in Police Magazine, author Kory Flowers said anarchists use protests such as the ones in Ferguson, Missouri, after the shooting death of Michael Brown, to launch their signature \"chaos- and havoc-laden tactics.\" The article described Black Bloc strategy as \"throngs of criminal anarchists all dress in black clothing in an effort to appear as a unified assemblage, giving the appearance of solidarity for the particular cause at hand.\" Robert Reich was halfway correct -- they are paramilitary -- but they are not conservative right-wingers. They are Reich’s fellow travelers on the communist magical mystery tour. We tend to think of the political spectrum as a line with the far left at one end, followed by Democrats/liberals, centrists in the middle, Republicans/conservatives to the right, and the far right at the other end. But it is actually more of a circle with the far left and far right overlapping where the circle closes. The extremes share an intolerance for alternate viewpoints and a commitment to force the adoption of their viewpoints under threat of incarceration, injury, or death; they share an ease imposing martial law and tactics to gain power; and they share a proclivity to limit the freedoms of ordinary citizens once they are in power. Their shared end goal is the creation of an omnipotent State in whatever form it takes, while browbeating the masses into submission to achieve whatever ends are desired. This is the point of the smiley face with the Hitler mustache on the cover of Jonah Goldberg’s Liberal Fascism. It is no coincidence that this seemingly innocuous icon of the 70s would don the mustache of history’s most notorious fascist -- a creamy hippy-socialism inside, covered by a chocolately National Socialism on the outside. Sickeningly sweet. But there are some differences between how each side regards the extremes. The left embraces the far left -- in this case, the Antifa. But the average rightwing conservative, Republican, or tea partier, abhors both the far left and the far right. Fidel, Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Goebbels, David Duke, and chameleon-opportunists who fit in nowhere and anywhere like Lyndon LaRouche have no place in the conservative agenda. All are equal-opportunity despots under whose rule none of us wants to live. But the left doesn’t understand that -- they think conservatives are allied with Nazis or Nazi-sympathizers. They cast mainstream conservatives in with these monsters, knowing full well that the only commonality the two share is what appears to be a random and meaningless placement on the right side of the political spectrum. Hillary Clinton was the mastermind behind this mindset: she conflated mainstream conservatives -- especially those who supported Trump -- with neo-Nazis and White Supremacists in her August 2016 Reno campaign speech. She singlehandedly primed the pump for the radical Pussy Hat March, Inauguration Day violence, and the Berkeley riots. Falsely accusing mainstream conservatives of being members of the far right is akin to saying the Jews drank the blood of Christian children. Blaming the Berkeley chaos on conservatives is like blaming the Jews for killing Jesus. Such blood libels do not end well for the victims, as charismatic rabble-rousers -- whether in the Pale of Settlement or Berkeley, CA -- rile up hysterical mobs that scapegoat their misery on the targeted group and ransack on demand. Rights become malleable or irrelevant in such situations. And, as reported in Berkeleyside.com, the freedoms to speak and assemble only apply to those who agree with the mob: Yvette Felarca, a [Berkeley Unified School District] teacher and a leader of [By Any Means Necessary], who has been captured on film engaging in violent resistance to right-wing speakers, declared the night a success. “I think shutting down and forcing the cancellation of a white supremacist like Milo Yiannopoulos was a stunning achievement….” “It isn’t a question of free speech,” said Felarca. “This is about our right to be free of intimidation.” And thus, their hypocrisy is on full display: protesters and rioters have a right not to be intimidated but Milo, the College Republicans, and those who wanted to hear his presentation, do not enjoy the same rights. The Berkeley Socialist Students posted on Indybay that Milo is “a figurehead for some of the most hateful right-wing elements in Trump's camp. We should allow no space for his message at UC Berkeley.” Socialists have the unfettered freedom to express their views, but capitalists like Milo, do not. These radicals are so blinded by their Weltanschauung, that they cannot see how their quest for tolerance and equality yields quite the opposite. Conservatives, who believe we should just sit back and watch the left be hoisted by their own petard, are naïve. It is wishful thinking to believe with each protest, riot and absurd comment, conservatives will look better while liberals implode. Here is the cold hard truth: with each riot and outrageous accusation, the left is emboldened. It doesn’t matter that their message is chaotic, their delivery cacophonous. It is irrelevant that WE think they look ridiculous. What matters to them is that they can manipulate the political scene today to achieve long-term goals ASAP. This is the culmination of decades of liberal efforts behind the scenes. They are simply leveraging the online infrastructure they have constructed, the vast networks they have built among the schools, the culture, the media, ex-Presidents, and current politicians, and the unity they have cultivated. They have just been waiting for the right moment to pounce. The election of a guy like Trump at a time when the fate of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance, when all political power in the states and federal government has shifted right, has provided them with that Arab Spring, Cuban Revolution, Bolshevik moment that gives them a collective thrill up their legs. This is all about building momentum towards a General Strike, a Revolution, the Fundamental Transformation. UC Berkeley student organizations may claim that they didn’t physically partake in the violence, that they merely pressured the university to cancel the event and, if that did not happen, they would (and did) take to the streets. Yet, when they failed to get the desired results, they were perfectly content to stand by and let Antifa throw police barricades through storefront windows, beat up Milo supporters, and start fires. This does not absolve them of responsibility. Via standing by and doing nothing while hoodlums in black shirts suppress speech and assembly, spread blood libels, batter fellow citizens, and destroy property, they incriminated themselves This is not simply leftwing hysteria we should ignore because we believe it will reflect poorly on liberals. It represents decades of rancor and resentment rising to the surface after a deliberate and systematic policy of dividing the country along gender, racial, and all manner of demographic lines. By dividing the nation into haves and have-nots instead of focusing on the “possibles,” the leftwing agenda has destroyed our great melting pot in all of its variety where the American Dream is achievable for all, and created instead, a cesspool of black and white between those who have achieved the American dream and others who are entitled to share in that success. Do not brush off these protests as the usual left wing rent-a-mobs. This is the stuff coups and revolutions are made of. Will our brainwashed children turn against us or worse yet, turn us in? Will our neighbors shoot us? Steal from us? Jail us? When the young and those who feel marginalized because of their color or economic circumstances are repeatedly told that conservatives are the devil, their parents are deplorable, and their neighbors are alt-right Nazis, they can actually see the horns on their parents’ heads and the brown shirts covering their neighbors’ bodies. When Democrats characterize mainstream Republicans and conservatives as members of the alt-right, they aren’t just on a slippery slope, but a sheer vertical drop from which there is no return. If this continues unaddressed, they will have our blood on their hands. I think the Berkeley College Republicans said it best: “It is tragic that the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement is also its final resting place.” Conservatives must decide if they want to prevent these self-proclaimed anti-fascist fascists from digging the grave, or stand by and watch. Hat tip: long time Bay Area resident, Lia, the inspiration for this article. Contrary to assertions by useful idiots like Robert Reich that the Berkeley riots were the work of paramilitary right-wingers, it has become increasingly evident that black-clad Antifa anarchists coordinated with Bay Area community activists and UC Berkeley student groups to orchestrate the violent protests against Milo Yiannapolous. The Antifa rioters are the same mask-wearing, black-outfitted, Molotov cocktail-throwing, fire-burning, stick-carrying pugilist punks featured in The Occupation Manifesto and The Occupation Devolution videos chronicling Occupy Oakland in 2011. Although some of us sounded the alarm, too few paid attention. Antifa is short for “anti-fascist” and is pronounced an-TEE-fah. According to left-leaning tech magazine Wired, they are “militant anti-fascist[s]” and “anarchists prone to property destruction and online abuse.they double down on political polarization, driving the national narrative even further from center.” For a deeper explanation into its historical roots, see The Washington Post, Wired Magazine, and USA Today. Antifa is believed to have been born in 1970s Germany -- a far left, communist, anti-fascist reaction to far right, neo-Nazi fascist groups ascendant at the time. It spread throughout Europe and found its way to the US where it seems to have first appeared at the WTO riots in Seattle. Like a bad rash, they keep popping up, having been actively engaged in the Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and anti-Trump movements. Like ISIS, independent “cells” exist all over the world. They are incredibly well-networked, trained in effective paramilitary tactics, and have a nuanced and sophisticated understanding, use and manipulation of the internet -- especially trolling, DDoS attacks, and their Bash the Fash and Meme Wars with the fascist alt-right. They are known for employing “Black Bloc” tactics at protests to achieve their ends -- forming a monolithic bloc by dressing in black and wearing black balaclavas or bandanas so as not to be identified by facial recognition software or cameras. According to the Washington Post, the hordes move in unison as one large, black-clad unidentifiable mass to “achieve both violent and nonviolent ends.” By putting on our masks we reveal our unity; and by raising our voices in the street together, we speak our anger at the facelessness of power,” reads a popular anarchist credo that was printed on the inside of masks distributed at a violent anti-capitalist protest in London in 1999. They carry thick poles to threaten, menace, and maim. According to USA Today: In a 2015 article published in Police Magazine, author Kory Flowers said anarchists use protests such as the ones in Ferguson, Missouri, after the shooting death of Michael Brown, to launch their signature \"chaos- and havoc-laden tactics.\" The article described Black Bloc strategy as \"throngs of criminal anarchists all dress in black clothing in an effort to appear as a unified assemblage, giving the appearance of solidarity for the particular cause at hand.\" Robert Reich was halfway correct -- they are paramilitary -- but they are not conservative right-wingers. They are Reich’s fellow travelers on the communist magical mystery tour. We tend to think of the political spectrum as a line with the far left at one end, followed by Democrats/liberals, centrists in the middle, Republicans/conservatives to the right, and the far right at the other end. But it is actually more of a circle with the far left and far right overlapping where the circle closes. The extremes share an intolerance for alternate viewpoints and a commitment to force the adoption of their viewpoints under threat of incarceration, injury, or death; they share an ease imposing martial law and tactics to gain power; and they share a proclivity to limit the freedoms of ordinary citizens once they are in power. Their shared end goal is the creation of an omnipotent State in whatever form it takes, while browbeating the masses into submission to achieve whatever ends are desired. This is the point of the smiley face with the Hitler mustache on the cover of Jonah Goldberg’s Liberal Fascism. It is no coincidence that this seemingly innocuous icon of the 70s would don the mustache of history’s most notorious fascist -- a creamy hippy-socialism inside, covered by a chocolately National Socialism on the outside. Sickeningly sweet. But there are some differences between how each side regards the extremes. The left embraces the far left -- in this case, the Antifa. But the average rightwing conservative, Republican, or tea partier, abhors both the far left and the far right. Fidel, Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Goebbels, David Duke, and chameleon-opportunists who fit in nowhere and anywhere like Lyndon LaRouche have no place in the conservative agenda. All are equal-opportunity despots under whose rule none of us wants to live. But the left doesn’t understand that -- they think conservatives are allied with Nazis or Nazi-sympathizers. They cast mainstream conservatives in with these monsters, knowing full well that the only commonality the two share is what appears to be a random and meaningless placement on the right side of the political spectrum. Hillary Clinton was the mastermind behind this mindset: she conflated mainstream conservatives -- especially those who supported Trump -- with neo-Nazis and White Supremacists in her August 2016 Reno campaign speech. She singlehandedly primed the pump for the radical Pussy Hat March, Inauguration Day violence, and the Berkeley riots. Falsely accusing mainstream conservatives of being members of the far right is akin to saying the Jews drank the blood of Christian children. Blaming the Berkeley chaos on conservatives is like blaming the Jews for killing Jesus. Such blood libels do not end well for the victims, as charismatic rabble-rousers -- whether in the Pale of Settlement or Berkeley, CA -- rile up hysterical mobs that scapegoat their misery on the targeted group and ransack on demand. Rights become malleable or irrelevant in such situations. And, as reported in Berkeleyside.com, the freedoms to speak and assemble only apply to those who agree with the mob: Yvette Felarca, a [Berkeley Unified School District] teacher and a leader of [By Any Means Necessary], who has been captured on film engaging in violent resistance to right-wing speakers, declared the night a success. “I think shutting down and forcing the cancellation of a white supremacist like Milo Yiannopoulos was a stunning achievement….” “It isn’t a question of free speech,” said Felarca. “This is about our right to be free of intimidation.” And thus, their hypocrisy is on full display: protesters and rioters have a right not to be intimidated but Milo, the College Republicans, and those who wanted to hear his presentation, do not enjoy the same rights. The Berkeley Socialist Students posted on Indybay that Milo is “a figurehead for some of the most hateful right-wing elements in Trump's camp. We should allow no space for his message at UC Berkeley.” Socialists have the unfettered freedom to express their views, but capitalists like Milo, do not. These radicals are so blinded by their Weltanschauung, that they cannot see how their quest for tolerance and equality yields quite the opposite. Conservatives, who believe we should just sit back and watch the left be hoisted by their own petard, are naïve. It is wishful thinking to believe with each protest, riot and absurd comment, conservatives will look better while liberals implode. Here is the cold hard truth: with each riot and outrageous accusation, the left is emboldened. It doesn’t matter that their message is chaotic, their delivery cacophonous. It is irrelevant that WE think they look ridiculous. What matters to them is that they can manipulate the political scene today to achieve long-term goals ASAP. This is the culmination of decades of liberal efforts behind the scenes. They are simply leveraging the online infrastructure they have constructed, the vast networks they have built among the schools, the culture, the media, ex-Presidents, and current politicians, and the unity they have cultivated. They have just been waiting for the right moment to pounce. The election of a guy like Trump at a time when the fate of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance, when all political power in the states and federal government has shifted right, has provided them with that Arab Spring, Cuban Revolution, Bolshevik moment that gives them a collective thrill up their legs. This is all about building momentum towards a General Strike, a Revolution, the Fundamental Transformation. UC Berkeley student organizations may claim that they didn’t physically partake in the violence, that they merely pressured the university to cancel the event and, if that did not happen, they would (and did) take to the streets. Yet, when they failed to get the desired results, they were perfectly content to stand by and let Antifa throw police barricades through storefront windows, beat up Milo supporters, and start fires. This does not absolve them of responsibility. Via standing by and doing nothing while hoodlums in black shirts suppress speech and assembly, spread blood libels, batter fellow citizens, and destroy property, they incriminated themselves This is not simply leftwing hysteria we should ignore because we believe it will reflect poorly on liberals.

The host asked, \"What is the Tea Party doing to be more diverse?\" I replied, \"Nothing.\" I went on to explain that I did not see a need for the Tea Party to make special concessions or pander to me because I am black. The host pressed further. \"No, I am not asking for special concessions. I want to know: what is the Tea Party doing to be more inclusive?\" I may have misunderstood his question. Perhaps I suffer slightly from Battered Conservative Syndrome. I get annoyed whenever I hear suggestions that conservatives should be more \"diverse\" and \"inclusive,\" because it usually means lowering behavioral and academic standards. When are you stuffy conservatives going to modernize, embrace an \"anything goes\" mindset, and appeal to the lowest common denominator? In essence, when are we going to be more like the Democrats? I believe that a majority of Americans instinctively gravitate to the pride and dignity of earning your own way. We do not want cradle-to-grave government dependency and imperialistic control over every aspect of our lives. We want our schools back; kids learning reading, writing, and arithmetic rather than curricula designed solely to create good liberals. We want fiscal responsibility. We want freedom and liberty restored. For these principles, patriots of all races stand side by side at Tea Party rallies. A popular belief is the word \"conservative\" has become toxic and polarizing. We are advised to spread our message subtly, without actually saying \"conservative.\" Hogwash! Educating Americans on the superiority of conservatism over liberalism can be achieved only by boldly touting conservatism's virtues, not by disguising who we are. Back to my radio interview. Well, I went into a rant defending the Tea Party. I called Democrat congressman Alan Grayson a despicable human being for comparing the Tea Party to the KKK. I chided NAACP president Ben Jealous for lying about seeing signs that read, \"Lynch Barack Obama\" and \"Lynch Eric Holder\" at a Tea Party. The host abruptly ended the interview: \"So sorry, Lloyd, we are out of time. Thank you very much.\" After the interview, I wondered if I overreacted and misunderstood the host's question. Perhaps he was simply asking what is the Tea Party doing in terms of outreach. I do believe that it is time for the Tea Party/conservatives to seriously reach out -- to get our message to a broader audience. More Americans need to know that conservatism is the best route to all achieving their American dream with pride and dignity. The Democrats are masters of low-rent \"pandering politics\" -- of sleazy, selfish politicians dividing Americans into weak, helpless, victimized voting blocs. Their message: You need me to protect you from rich white male racist conservative Republicans. In my youth, President Ronald Reagan made me feel good about myself and my country -- inspired to be all I could be. And yet, I do not recall Reagan making any references to my skin color, or telling me I was a victim of anything. The Tea Party attracted me by simply touting wholesome, commonsense, traditional, all-American principles and values. Word on the political street is that the GOP is getting \"whiter and older.\" To attract young and minority voters, the GOP must kick out old fuddy-duddy conservatives. They should forever pander to blacks as traumatized victims of slavery. I submit that decades of liberal Democrat pandering, of lowering the bar, has devastated the black community; over 70% born out of wedlock, over 70% school dropout rate, high incarceration, and nearly 50% of black pregnancies ending in abortion. How's that black monolithic embrace of liberal Democrat fixes workin' for ya? However, conservatives must do a much better job of reaching dumbed down voters and our indoctrinated youths. In the war of messaging, liberal Democrats are kicking our butts. At one time, I thought we were in a battle of ideas. We are not. History confirms that conservatism is the far superior idea. Liberalism fails everywhere it is tried. Ours is a war of messaging -- ofgetting the truth to the masses and countering the lies of Democrats, Hollywood, and liberal media. Rush Limbaugh's new bestselling children's book, Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims, is a prime example of Tea Party/conservative outreach -- of spreading truth in a creative and entertaining way. I would love to see \"Reach Your Dreams\" rallies brought to minorities, with successful conservative black and Hispanic speakers sharing their personal stories, supported with conservative rappers and singers providing musical entertainment. Please note that I am not advocating pandering to minorities with a \"liberal lite\" message. I am talking about an unapologetic celebration of conservatism packaged to communicate to targeted audiences. Though our messaging task may be Herculean, conservatism truly is \"real\" compassion.

        "articles": "We now know that the FBI's dereliction of duty regarding Hillary Clinton's e-mail malfeasance is complete. Not only did Director James Comey have the gall to explain her guilt in the very statement in which he announced that he (against the better judgment of some agents) would not recommend charges against her, but the FBI actually agreed to destroy laptops containing relevant evidence, thereby handicapping any future investigation. Loyal Democrat voters could breathe easily again. For months, they had squirmed under the awkward burden of knowing their presidential nominee had been caught violating federal law. Let me emphasize that point. They were not afraid their nominee had broken the law; they believed, as we all did, that she had broken it. (Not only do I feel confident in asserting that most of Clinton's supporters know she violated the law; in assuming this, I am actually applying the principle of charity, as I am granting that her supporters have enough common sense to see the obvious.) The important question in their minds was whether she would actually be prosecuted for her violation, as any of us would certainly be in like circumstances. Not that a prosecution would have changed anyone's voting preference, mind you. After all, Democrat voters, like most products of late modernity's progressive socialization process, have long-since accepted that the privileged members of the ruling political and corporate elite cannot be held to the same moral or legal standards as the rest of us. These voters wouldn't want to think the teenager who made their fast food burgers had been shoplifting from a convenience store. But knowing that they are about to give the most powerful office on Earth to a serial violator of federal law -- even of a law with the ominous title \"The Espionage Act\" -- causes nary a twinge of self-doubt. For you see, they, and we, all feel, deep in our hearts, that the teenager at the burger joint, the middle manager at the bank, the construction worker, the housewife, the small business owner, the nurse, and we ourselves, being mere ordinary people, are subject to the laws of our respective communities, whereas the progressive elite -- the elect and the elected -- are above the law. We all instinctively sense that among the elite, crime and punishment are mere political ploys. The progressive Republican Party hoped to have Clinton prosecuted for the same reason the progressive Democratic Party wanted to have Congressman Tom Delay prosecuted: it's good electoral strategy. The loyal Democrat voters' only concern was the pragmatic question of whether they would have to vote for Hillary without knowing the outcome of her trial, not whether a woman who flaunts her disdain for the laws and security of her country has any business running for office. Having been spared this discomfort by the powers that be, they could finally rally behind her \"historic campaign\" with vigor. They were relieved not because she was innocent, but because, though obviously guilty by any standard applicable to ordinary people, Clinton, who is not of ordinary blood, would not have to deal with any \"October surprise\" publicity in the form of a prosecution. This is not a victory of justice, a category that does not apply to the elite, much as Aristotle says it does not apply to the gods. It is a victory of politics, of electoral gamesmanship. Hillary had her pieces lined up in a way that allowed her to get away (again!) with acts that, in the bygone age of equality before the law, might have landed her in prison. Two points for her! In the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, I wrote that America had voted to end modern civilization -- literally, that a major world-historical shift had, for the first time, been effected by means of a democratic election. America, the planet's last principled guardian of modernity's political victories -- natural equality, individual sovereignty, limited republican government -- was faced with the choice of reelecting or rejecting a Marxist president supported by the Communist Party, who had promised to fundamentally transform the country and used his first term to begin fulfilling that promise. She voted to stay the course, although the course, in this case, meant an ever-accelerating descent toward the abyss of Ronald Reagan's projected \"thousand years of darkness.\" When I wrote that assessment in 2012, many dismissed my thesis as poetic excess or a passing mood evoked by a disappointing election result. Wrong. \"Disappointing\" is a word we use to describe a result that might realistically have turned out otherwise. Watching your favorite baseball team being eliminated from the playoffs is disappointing. Finding out the new owners of your favorite restaurant have changed the recipes is disappointing. But watching a glorious seven-hundred-year historical arc exhausting itself at last; seeing the immense intellectual achievements of philosophers and artists from Aquinas and Dante to Locke and Swift being snuffed out in favor of neo-Marxist critical theory and the nihilistic, infantilizing vulgarity of our popular entertainment; and observing in real time the final outcome of the civilized world's two-hundred-year submersion in the moral quicksand of government-controlled child-rearing (i.e., public school), is not \"disappointing.\" It is revelatory. What has been revealed is that this age has tempted fate too long. Tocqueville's prediction, more than one hundred seventy-five years ago, about the peculiar threat to political freedom, namely the successful free people's careless slide into the comfortable compliance of soft despotism, has not merely proved correct; it has perhaps become irreversible. (If you think Donald Trump can reverse it, or would even care to, I'll grant that this is a moment for grasping at straws if ever there was one; for my part, I am inclined to see him as, in effect if not in intention, the best friend Hillary Clinton ever had.) The disaster must play itself out, one way or another. The American majority, primed over generations for this moment, is finally embracing its demise, and therefore indirectly the demise of the entire civilized world, which for generations has stupidly and ungraciously enjoyed its Doomsday Eve party primarily on America's dime. One of the chief, and most irreversible, symptoms of modernity's decay is the abandonment of the premise of all justice in a modern free society, namely equality before the law. When a majority of men accept the immunity of their \"betters\" to federal law, not merely as a practical fact of political corruption but as a forgivable and overlookable reality -- that is, as acceptable -- you can be sure you are witnessing a society in freefall. For its majority has succumbed to the fundamental legal premise of tyranny, which means men have rationalized their own enslavement. The Doomsday Eve party is winding down. The remaining drunken revelers, exhausted by excess and having crossed the line between Dionysian freedom and Dionysian chaos, are slowly being delivered into a long, much-needed sleep. Not a very restful one, I'm afraid. (The author invites you to visit his new website, darenjonescu.com, where you can find his new book, The Case Against Public Education, and much more.) We now know that the FBI's dereliction of duty regarding Hillary Clinton's e-mail malfeasance is complete. Not only did Director James Comey have the gall to explain her guilt in the very statement in which he announced that he (against the better judgment of some agents) would not recommend charges against her, but the FBI actually agreed to destroy laptops containing relevant evidence, thereby handicapping any future investigation.

(If you think Donald Trump can reverse it, or would even care to, I'll grant that this is a moment for grasping at straws if ever there was one; for my part, I am inclined to see him as, in effect if not in intention, the best friend Hillary Clinton ever had.) The disaster must play itself out, one way or another. The American majority, primed over generations for this moment, is finally embracing its demise, and therefore indirectly the demise of the entire civilized world, which for generations has stupidly and ungraciously enjoyed its Doomsday Eve party primarily on America's dime. One of the chief, and most irreversible, symptoms of modernity's decay is the abandonment of the premise of all justice in a modern free society, namely equality before the law. When a majority of men accept the immunity of their \"betters\" to federal law, not merely as a practical fact of political corruption but as a forgivable and overlookable reality -- that is, as acceptable -- you can be sure you are witnessing a society in freefall. For its majority has succumbed to the fundamental legal premise of tyranny, which means men have rationalized their own enslavement. The Doomsday Eve party is winding down. The remaining drunken revelers, exhausted by excess and having crossed the line between Dionysian freedom and Dionysian chaos, are slowly being delivered into a long, much-needed sleep. Not a very restful one, I'm afraid. (The author invites you to visit his new website, darenjonescu.com, where you can find his new book, The Case Against Public Education, and much more.)",

That problem beat out the economy (11%), unemployment (10%), and health care (7%). March was the fourth month in a row, and the eighth time in the past year, that government was named as the primary problem. The latest poll results are based on interviews conducted March 5-8, 2015. A random sample of 1,025 adults were asked, \"What do you think is the most important problem facing the country today?\" The margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. And here is a big problem with government: The Gallup poll result is consistent with research conducted by Ilyana Kuziemko, Michael I. Norton, Emmanuel Saez, and Stefanie Stantcheva, published in 2013 by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Five thousand Americans polled by this research didn't trust the government to do the redistributing of income. An original research assumption was that \"the more people knew about how the rich were getting richer, the more they would pressure their representatives in Washington to redistribute that wealth more 'fairly'.\" But \"[e]vidence from survey data does not support this prediction.\" In fact, exactly the opposite is occurring. The research found: Author Emmanuel Saez said: Standard models predict that support for redistribution should increase with income inequality, yet there has been little evidence of greater demand for [government] redistribution over the past thirty years in the US, despite historic increases in income concentration[.] \"Standard models,\" huh? Perhaps they need to be updated. But don't expect the Democrats or the MSM to do it. After all, they got Obama elected and re-elected. Further, research by Matthew Luttig found exactly the same thing. Said Luttig: Numerous political theorists suggest that rising inequality and the shift in the distribution of income to those at the top should lead to increasing support for liberal policies. But recent evidence contradicts these theories[.] ... In general, the evidence supports the claim that rising inequality has been a force promoting conservatism in the American public. ... the absolute level and the changing structure of inequality have largely been a force promoting conservatism, not increasing support for redistribution as theoretically expected. The MSM, not wanting to appear foolish (too late), has recently published several articles on this subject, albeit two years tardy.

        "articles": "Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) plans to introduce (or has already introduced) gun-control legislation in the 113th Congress, ostensibly to protect the lives of children, and to curb mass murders, like the one that occurred in Newtown, CT. At the same time, Feinstein is very pro-choice and supports taxpayer funding for abortions. She opposes bans on partial-birth abortion. She has spoken about the constitutional right to an abortion and, in 2003, on the Senate floor, spoke in support of Roe v Wade. She, in 2005, opposed the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. The above paragraph alone demonstrates Senator Feinstein's hypocrisy when it comes to protecting the lives of children. But let's go farther. Feinstein has, in her public life, said that she is Jewish. Then Feinstein said, before running for the Senate, that she is not Jewish. So it seems that Feinstein's religion could best be described as feminism or liberalism. In the words of \"Church Lady\" on SNL, \"How conveeenient!\" The Jewish faith does not permit abortions unless the health of the mother is threatened (in other words, not on demand). Feinstein decided that she was not Jewish when the faith's tenets interfered with her personal beliefs. There were, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in 2009 11,493 people murdered with guns. But Senator Feinstein seemed to overlook the fact that, in 2008, 1.21 million abortions were performed. Just so you know, the CDC says that in 1998 (the last year for which estimates were made), over 23 percent of legally induced abortions were performed in California. By the way, Feinstein was elected to the U.S. Senate from California in 1992. Abortion and election coincidence? Your call. Planned Parenthood (PP) announced that, in 2011 alone, it performed 333,964 abortions. PP said that was a record year for the organization. PP performed, between 2009 and 2011, almost 1 million abortions. Fully 92 percent of pregnant women who seek help from PP get an abortion. PP likes to talk about its \"other\" services, but records indicate that other services are declining: abortions are up while contraception services are down. Since 2009, contraceptive services have dropped by 12 percent. Similarly, cancer screening and prevention services have dropped by 29 percent. Prenatal care and adoption referrals accounted for only 7 percent and 0.6 percent of their other services. For perspective, PP performed 145 abortions for each adoption referral. For further perspective, fully 45 percent of PP's annual revenue is provided by taxpayer dollars. PP received, in FY2011, government grants, contracts, and Medicaid reimbursements of $542 million in taxpayer funding. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA List, said: \"Planned Parenthood has spent much of the last few years demanding that taxpayers add millions more to their coffers, citing their non-profit status and so-called focus on women's health. What have we received for our money? While government subsidies to Planned Parenthood have reached an all time high, so too has the number of lives ended by this profit-driven abortion business. Destroying nearly one million children in three years is not health care and does not reflect a concern for vulnerable women and girls. As Planned Parenthood's funding goes up, abortions increase and real health services for women go down. \"As if these numbers weren't already horrifying, Planned Parenthood has upped the ante even further by mandating that all affiliates provide abortions beginning this year. Americans are sick and tired of underwriting the nation's largest abortion business. We call on Congress to immediately investigate and defund Planned Parenthood.\" PP, in FY2011, reported $87.4 million in revenue that exceeded expenses. It also has in excess of $1.2 billion in net assets. Americans United for Life spokeswoman Charmaine Yoest said: Planned Parenthood's story in 2013 reveals an abortion-centered business model. The nation's largest abortion provider continues to make ever-more money from the suffering of women and girls as the leader of Big Abortion. So, Senator Feinstein, you will introduce a bill designed to outlaw \"the sale, the transfer, the importation and the possession of assault weapons.\" Yet nowhere can I find a bill that you've introduced defunding PP, or even reducing its abortion activities. Can I not find the bill because you failed to introduce it? You are, after all, trying to protect the lives of children, regardless of how they are murdered. Or is your hypocrisy again showing?

Inevitably, the conversation turned to Venezuela.My friend from Venezuela shared a joke going around Caracas. It goes sort of like this: \"What did we do before Chávez?\" The answer is: \"We used electricity and hair-dryers.\"We laughed, but not for long. The follow-up joke was this: \"What's the hottest selling item on sale at the Venezuela-Colombia border?\" The answer is \"candles.\" At this point, I did not laugh, but I did say an \"expletive deleted\" comment about Chávez and Maduro.According to Sukanti Bhave, who has been working with refugees on the border, the situation is terrible: The bridge in Cucuta is the busiest border between the two countries. With the shortage of necessities in Venezuela, residents of the border town, San Antonio de Tachira, often buy basic necessities (toilet paper, diapers, laundry detergent, etc.), from Colombian supermarkets at the border. Jaimes Suarez and his wife have three children, including a six-month-old daughter. The couple crossed the border with their baby to buy groceries and candles in Cucuta. \"San Antonio isn't a functional city anymore. Stores are closed. Candles are sold on the black market. But they are very expensive,\" says Suarez. Without electricity, they have no means of storing food or milk for the baby. Neither can they cook fresh meals. A few years ago, the Suarez family started using an electric stove. \"Cooking gas is state managed, and we would get one cylinder every few months. It was difficult to cook sufficient meals until the next distribution of gas cylinders. The service was unreliable,\" he adds. They tell me that electricity is heavily subsidized in Venezuela. However, there have been frequent power cuts since 2009. \"Caracas wasn't affected by power cuts before this year, but in many other states, we remained without electricity for three to four hours almost every day.

The corrupt Obama/Biden Justice department continually used the false dossier to mislead the FISA court to spy on Trump associates. The biased Mueller investigation continued its witch hunt against Trump associates even though they knew the Russian collusion story was a hoax. They destroyed people like Gen. Michael Flynn even though they knew he committed no crime. The media and other Democrats not only weren’t outraged that they targeted innocent people, they feigned outrage when Trump pardoned Flynn and others destroyed by the corrupted Justice department. The biased Muller team didn’t go after any of the criminals in the Obama/Biden administration who perpetuated the fraud of the Russian collusion. Rep. Adam Schiff, former intelligence chief James Clapper, Rep. Eric Swalwell, and others continually lied about having evidence of Russian collusion. The media still uses these congenital liars as sources. The media not only didn’t get outraged by the false Russian collusion stories, they participated for years in spreading the lies and then gave themselves journalism awards for intentionally misleading the public. The corrupt Obama Justice department was used to target political opponents and obstructed justice by destroying computers and lying to Congress. The corrupted Justice department under wingman Attorney General Eric Holder let them off. They were all above the law. Hillary Clinton and her aides repeatedly violated the nation's security laws and were allowed by the corrupt Justice department to destroy computers and documents. They were also above the law. That the corrupt Obama/Biden administration continually lied through the compliant media to get the Iran deal done, gave cash kickbacks to Iran's tyrants, and let off terrorist drug runners, all to appease Iran. Most of the media still support the deal with the biggest terrorist-sponsoring state that still pledges death to America. The Bidens and Clintons used their powerful government positions to enrich themselves and their families with huge kickbacks from foreign parties. Biden blackmailed Ukraine with one billion of taxpayer money if they didn’t fire a prosecutor. Biden continually lied that he had no idea what his son was doing. The media covered up the Hunter Biden story including the laptop while they were campaigning for him. Schiff and fifty former intelligence officials willingly lied that the Hunter Biden laptop story in the New York Post looked like Russian disinformation. The media used that as a cover story to bury the information from the public. Antifa and other leftist groups looted, committed arson, destroyed communities, and intentionally harmed police. The compliant media called these violent groups \"mostly peaceful\" to mislead the public. The Washington Post, CNN and others sought to destroy white Christian boys by calling them racists for the crime of wearing MAGA hats. The Washington Post and others sought to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh without evidence, just because they didn’t like his Constitutional views. Politicians keep schools and other businesses closed despite no scientific evidence supporting the closures. Democrats refuse to support giving health care to babies born alive. Election officials in several states violated the Constitution and their state laws in the 2020 election. To the media and other Democrats, it is baseless to question this lawlessness. Election officials in some states stopped counting, for no apparent reason, stopped counting on election night for a while and poll watchers were kicked out. We are told that any questions are baseless. Signatures on voting records aren’t matched against the ballots. Voting machines switch votes. We are told that is not a problem. And now we see the same thing again, this time in Georgia, with its last-ditch Senate runoff. Of course, most of the media and other Democrats baselessly say that photo IDs to vote are racist because they really don’t care about election integrity. But there is absolute outrage by the media, Democrats, and some Republicans that Trump dares call the secretary of state in Georgia to ask for a signature audit in Fulton County, to ask why poll watchers were sent away, and why counting occurred while they were gone, as well as to ask why there was a fake water main break to stop the counting. There has also been fake outrage for years about Trump supposedly not denouncing white supremacists and allowing the lies about what Trump said in Charlottesville by Biden and others to continue. They also spread the Atlanta Journal-Constitution story, with much evidence that it didn’t happen, that Trump disparaged the military, before the election to help Biden. There are many threats to our freedom, democracy, and prosperity and none of them have to do with Trump challenging the election results when there was so much intentional malfeasance. What's a real threat are the thought police and the cancel culture. When Pelosi and Democrats in the House say you can’t use terms like mother, father, sister, and brother, we have powerful swamp creatures who are lacking common sense and at odds with what Americans value. When the media blocks information that contradicts Dr. Anthony Fauci and the World Health Organization (WHO), no matter how much they have gotten wrong, that is dangerous. When people disagree with the indoctrination about climate change, they are stifled. No matter how wrong the previous dire predictions have been, the public is told that the science is settled, and we must stop using oil. The climate change pushers never have to give evidence to support their policies. But the biggest threat of all to our freedom, democracy, prosperity, and survival as a great country is a media that almost exclusively campaigns for one party and seeks to destroy the other. They do not care how corrupt or radical the Democrats are if they have that “D” behind their name. Just repeating talking points is worthless and non-essential. It is a shame that most of them have remained on payrolls while they support lockdowns that are greatly harming the poor, the middle class, women, children, minorities, and small businesses, whom they only pretend to care about. All they care about is power for Democrats and the government.

The media used that as a cover story to bury the information from the public. Antifa and other leftist groups looted, committed arson, destroyed communities, and intentionally harmed police. The compliant media called these violent groups \"mostly peaceful\" to mislead the public. The Washington Post, CNN and others sought to destroy white Christian boys by calling them racists for the crime of wearing MAGA hats. The Washington Post and others sought to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaugh without evidence, just because they didn’t like his Constitutional views. Politicians keep schools and other businesses closed despite no scientific evidence supporting the closures. Democrats refuse to support giving health care to babies born alive. Election officials in several states violated the Constitution and their state laws in the 2020 election. To the media and other Democrats, it is baseless to question this lawlessness. Election officials in some states stopped counting, for no apparent reason, stopped counting on election night for a while and poll watchers were kicked out. We are told that any questions are baseless. Signatures on voting records aren’t matched against the ballots. Voting machines switch votes. We are told that is not a problem. And now we see the same thing again, this time in Georgia, with its last-ditch Senate runoff. Of course, most of the media and other Democrats baselessly say that photo IDs to vote are racist because they really don’t care about election integrity. But there is absolute outrage by the media, Democrats, and some Republicans that Trump dares call the secretary of state in Georgia to ask for a signature audit in Fulton County, to ask why poll watchers were sent away, and why counting occurred while they were gone, as well as to ask why there was a fake water main break to stop the counting. There has also been fake outrage for years about Trump supposedly not denouncing white supremacists and allowing the lies about what Trump said in Charlottesville by Biden and others to continue. They also spread the Atlanta Journal-Constitution story, with much evidence that it didn’t happen, that Trump disparaged the military, before the election to help Biden. There are many threats to our freedom, democracy, and prosperity and none of them have to do with Trump challenging the election results when there was so much intentional malfeasance. What's a real threat are the thought police and the cancel culture. When Pelosi and Democrats in the House say you can’t use terms like mother, father, sister, and brother, we have powerful swamp creatures who are lacking common sense and at odds with what Americans value. When the media blocks information that contradicts Dr. Anthony Fauci and the World Health Organization (WHO), no matter how much they have gotten wrong, that is dangerous. When people disagree with the indoctrination about climate change, they are stifled. No matter how wrong the previous dire predictions have been, the public is told that the science is settled, and we must stop using oil. The climate change pushers never have to give evidence to support their policies. But the biggest threat of all to our freedom, democracy, prosperity, and survival as a great country is a media that almost exclusively campaigns for one party and seeks to destroy the other. They do not care how corrupt or radical the Democrats are if they have that “D” behind their name. Just repeating talking points is worthless and non-essential. It is a shame that most of them have remained on payrolls while they support lockdowns that are greatly harming the poor, the middle class, women, children, minorities, and small businesses, whom they only pretend to care about. All they care about is power for Democrats and the government. Image credit: Pixabay public domain",

        "articles": "Of all the executive orders that newly elected Joe Biden swiftly enacted, nothing is more indicative of his anti-American animus and radical left-wing influence than his revoking Trump's \"1776 Commission\" to promote \"patriotic education.\" The 1776 Commission to Create a Patriotic History Curriculum is in direct contrast to the \"1619 Project,\" which reflects a decidedly anti-American, factually incorrect, and blatantly biased program currently being pushed through the U.S. education system. The mission of the 1776 Commission is \"to defend the legacy of America's founding, the virtue of America's heroes, and the nobility of the American character.\" But the left continues the mendacious onslaught of falsehoods about America. Considering the people Biden is choosing to assist him, this move should come as no surprise. After all, Susan Rice, his incoming domestic policy adviser, views America as a racist nation. In fact: [I]n 1986 she wrote an 86-page book titled A History Deferred, which claimed that because most U.S. students were 'taught American history, literature, art, drama, and music largely from a white, western European perspective, their grasp of the truth, of reality, is tainted by a myopia of sorts.' Hence, '[t]he greatest evil in omitting or misrepresenting Black history, literature, and culture in elementary or secondary education is the unmistakable message it sends to the black child,' Rice elaborated. 'The message is 'your history, your culture, your language and your literature are insignificant. And so are you.' Susan Rice's presence indicates that we are headed for Obama's third term with Biden as a mere figurehead. In truth, the \"1619 Project rewrites American history to teach our children that we were founded on the principle of oppression, not freedom. Nothing could be further from the truth. America's founding set in motion the unstoppable chain of events that abolished slavery, secured civil rights, defeated communism and fascism, and built the most fair, equal and prosperous nation in human history.\" That an American president would find it palatable to replace American history with a blatantly \"leftist warped, distorted and deceptive one\" is a frightening portent. Other radical left-wingers include secretary of defense nominee Lloyd Austin, who said that if he is confirmed, he will \"rid our ranks of racists and extremists.\" By \"racists and extremists,\" he is referring to white male Trump supporters. And for the first time in our lives, free speech is about to be criminalized — the ultimate leftist dream come true. All of Biden's edicts flow from this abhorrence of American ideas. Clearly, his actions are meant to efface every MAGA achievement by President Trump. Biden is quite willing and eager to rob Americans of their birthright. In his final speech, President Trump asserted that Now, as I leave the White House, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world's most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes, for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. At the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are and how we got here could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It's not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions. These ideas stand in utter contrast to the left/Marxist/communist ideology, which is all about identity politics, not liberty and justice. Government by consent is an anathema to the totalitarian left. Indeed, \"[f]or far too long American students ... have been taught to consider America to be a hateful, racist country instead of a republic [which is] a government ... designed to be directed by the will of the people rather than the wishes of a single individual or a narrow class of elites.\" Elites like these, perhaps? Moreover, Biden is on board for the diversity and equity theories of the left. But the 1776 Report clearly states that \"by dividing Americans into oppressed and oppressor groups, activists of identity politics propose to punish some citizens ... while rewarding others. This new system denies that human beings are endowed with the same rights and creates new hierarchies with destructive assumptions and practices. Members of oppressed groups are told to abandon their shared civic identity as Americans and think of themselves in terms of their sexual or racial status.\" Such \"diversity training programs which are based on identity politics often use a person's race to degrade or ostracize him or her.\" Nonetheless, Biden's \"cabinet nominees, whether in health, finance, environmental policy, or education, have declared that eradicating systemic racism is their top priority. How this agenda will play out has already been adumbrated in the CDC's initial priority list for Covid vaccinations: hold off on vaccinating the elderly, despite their higher risk levels, because the elderly are disproportionately white. Racial quotas will become even more the order of the day than now. The diversity obsessives in the federal science bureaucracies ... will now redouble their efforts to treat a researcher's race and sex as scientific qualifications in the awarding of federal research grants. Expect to see any mention of merit or excellence denounced as a form of bigotry[.]\" The charge about systemic racism is standard leftist offal. It flies in the face of the fact that \"Kamala Harris is not only our first female vice president but also the first Democratic vice president who is a person of color.\" Thus, \"her charge of 'systemic racism' would make it impossible for her to discharge the duties of her office because she would not be eligible to vote or serve in public office if it were true.\" Moreover, \"systemic racism would require the interposition and nullification of the 15th and 19th Amendments to the Constitution [but] these facts do not matter.\" Because so many Americans are unschooled concerning the major foundational American ideas, they fail to see that \"the degradations of individuals on the basis of race expose the lie that identity politics promotes the equal protection of rights.\" In essence, \"identity politics denies the fundamental tenet of the Declaration of Independence, that human beings are equal by nature.\" So what exactly would newly elected President Biden find problematic or offensive with the 1776 Project? It does not align with his values or the beliefs of his radical leftist allies. In the past 50 years, leftists have taken over the schools, and the endgame is a total transformation of this country. The puppet-master Obama said as much. Never forget that the left is hell-bent on destroying the nuclear family and making government the \"parent.\" We are about to see \"a great socialist/Marxist reset in America in which these things will be brought to bear upon us by a radicalized leftist Democrat party. Globalism will be implemented by almost imperceptible increments.\" If we continue \"to fail to educate American youth about effective, representative, and limited government, the rule of law and the security of civil rights and private property\" as well as a \"love of the natural world and the arts, good character and religious faith\" we will no longer be the \"shining city on the hill\" and that will be a tragedy of epic proportions. If we do not \"instill the beauty and glory of American identity,\" as President Trump explained, we are, indeed, in dire danger of losing who we are to the poisonous ideology that rules the leftist mind. Clearly, Biden is delighted with that possibility. Eileen can be reached at middlemarch18@gmail.com. Image: Gage Skidmore via Flickr, CC BY-SA 2.0.

A McClatchy story published yesterday must have Democratic Party elders and the Obama White House, especially Valerie Jarrett, plotting the most effective way to dump her before she takes down the party in the 2016 election. Using already-published texts of one email and leaks apparently from a congressional staffer, McClatchy Washington Bureau reporters Marisa Taylor, Greg Gordon And Anita Kumar write: The classified emails stored on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private server contained information from five U.S. intelligence agencies and included material related to the fatal 2012 Benghazi attacks, McClatchy has learned. Of the five classified emails, the one known to be connected to Benghazi was among 296 emails made public in May by the State Department. Intelligence community officials have determined it was improperly released. (snip) â¨ McClatchy also has determined some details of the five emails that the intelligence community’s inspector general has described as classified and improperly handled. Intelligence officials who reviewed the five classified emails determined that they included information from five separate intelligence agencies, said a congressional official with knowledge of the matter. â¨Hillary’s previous statement that there was nothing on her emails that was “classified at the time” just won’t wash: “Even if Secretary Clinton or her aides didn’t run afoul of any criminal provisions, the fact that classified information was identified within the emails is exactly why use of private emails . . . is not supposed to be allowed,” said Bradley Moss, a Washington attorney who specializes in national security matters. “Both she and her team made a serious management mistake that no one should ever repeat.” â¨The 30,000 emails that she has turned over to the State Department also exist, completely outside of any security protection, on a thumb drive she turned over to her lawyer, David Kendall. This means that any mugger, burglar, or intelligence agency conceivably could get ahold of this US government confidential information: On June 25, McCullough notified members of Congress that he understood that Clinton’s attorney, David Kendall, possessed the more than 30,000 Clinton emails on a computer thumb drive. In a July 24 letter to FBI Director James Comey, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa expressed concern about “a compromise of national security information” because of Kendall’s possession of the thumb drive. He called on Comey to explain what steps the FBI had taken to secure the information. “This raises very serious questions and concerns if a private citizen is somehow retaining classified information,” wrote Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Kendall did not respond to phone and email messages. The FBI and the Justice Department declined to say whether security officials had recovered the device or had arranged for its secure storage. â¨”Reckless” is the kindest accurate description of this sort of behavior. It is, quite simply, indefensible, and any GOP candidate for president could demolish Hillary in a debate over her exposing secrets to any foreign intelligence agency that cared to look. “Thumb drive” is an expression that carries a concrete image for most people under the age of 80. The picture of David Kendall walking around with a thumb drive in his pocket containing vital secrets of 5 US intelligence agencies is made for a 30 second TV spot. Hillary’s fate now rests in the tender hands of Valerie Jarrett, who almost certainly is advising President Obama on what to do next. The last thing she or he wants is a Republican president who can undo his executive orders. They do not want to be seen as torpedoing Hillary willfully, but they need to signal her that if she does not withdraw “in order to spend more time with her granddaughter,” the forensics team at the FBI is going to be working on the hard drive of her home server recovering the sordid details of her haggling with foreign governments and state-controlled enterprises over money for the Clinton Foundation and Bill’s speaking fees. My guess is that the new(ish) Attorney General Loretta Lynch is going to nod in the direction of launching an investigation, not publicly, but in ways that let Team Hillary know that they will be coming for her server if things don’t change.

        "articles": "President Obama has broken many promises. One that he has not broken is his boast that he would \"fundamentally transform America.\" He and his fellow Democrats are on the verge of doing just that by turning us into a nation of loafers. A loafer is an idle person who lives off others. Barack Obama seemingly has no problem with such people. He might even relate to them. He does have a serious problem with his own work ethic, and finds work boring. He also denigrates the work of others who build businesses through dint of hard work and risk-taking (\"You didn't build that\"); talks incessantly of \"fat cats\" on Wall Street; embraced the Occupy Wall Street Movement of squatters and pumped up their own inflated self-importance by telling them \"You are the reason I ran for office\"; and accuses doctors of running up the tab by, among other evils, taking tonsils out for money instead of diagnosing problems as allergies). He has yet to speak critically of union leaders, class action lawyers and others who run up the tab for all Americans because they are, after all, the Democratic Base. But Obama and his Democratic Party allies seem to be gleeful about the rise of the loafer class. Recent revelations from the Congressional Budget Office bear witness to this phenomenon. When the CBO's prognosis on the future of Obamacare revealed that the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs would be lost because the provisions of the law would create disincentives to working (as well as hiring) what was the response from the left side of the political spectrum? Investor's Business Daily listed a few of them in The Left's Lamest Defense of ObamaCare Yet: Jason Furman, Obama's Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, also tried to spin these projected job losses into good news by saying ObamaCare would allow workers greater \"choice.\" Furman said, \"This is not businesses cutting back on jobs. This is people having new choices.\" If taxpayer-funded health insurance encourages some people to work less, \"that, in their case, might be a better choice and a better option that what they had before.\" Then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi unwittingly revealed this goal years ago in a comment that unsurprisingly got little airplay in the mainstream media when she toasted the fact that the health care reform that she and her fellow Democrats forced down America's throat would be a godsend for the \"creative class\": Think of an economy where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance. Yes...think about it! The lady from San Francisco does not think about the plumbers, contractors, accountants, sanitation workers and legions of other Morlocks toiling away for the benefit of artistic Elois and their patrons. Maybe performers can be hired to entertain government bureaucrats during over-the-top government junkets, or for IRS training films, or sculpt artwork that can be sold at outrageous prices to grace American embassies across the world for the delectation of Obama donors-ambassadors. Well, these people's choice to work less in order to qualify for subsidies to pay their health insurance premiums means that other people are paying for their liberation from work and from the responsibilities of being an adult and an American (at least what used to be considered an American). But such a goal is very attractive for loafers. ObamaCare also makes it very appealing for children to be coddled by their parents. Instead of becoming fully-functioning adults, paying their own way in the world, they can stay under their parents' insurance policies until the age of 26-further reducing the incentive to mature out of loafer-dom. Paul Ryan noted this sad state of affairs at the Republican National Convention: College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life. More 27-year olds are living in their parents' basements than with roommates-and this is true for college graduates, as well. But what if the Democratic Party does not want them to be anything other than loafers? That can be a very appealing prospect for many people. After all, Obama telegraphed his goal in 2008, making a Kinsley gaffe (a politician accidentally telling the truth) when he went off the teleprompter and told Joe the Plumber that his goal was to \"spread the wealth.\" How have Obama and his fellow Democrats achieved that goal? Count the ways: Endless extensions of unemployment insurance to anesthetize jobless Americans from the pain of reckless Democratic anti-growth policies; Record high food stamp usage; A record number on disability were getting the highest-ever monthly benefits; Labor Force participation rates have declined; people not in the labor force are at a record 91.8 million; Democrats are encouraging people to get on the government dole at an early age. High-school students are constantly exhorted to go to college. John Kerry typified the view of liberals when he told a crowd of Ohio voters: You know, education, if you make the most of it, if you study hard and you do your homework, and you make an effort to be smart, uh, you, you can do well. If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq. Barack Obama has repeatedly said that he thinks everyone should go to college -- seemingly oblivious to the reality that college may not be appropriate for everyone. Millions of people have come out of college with degrees that do not lead to jobs but have led to unsupportable debt loads. Collectively there may be more than a trillion dollars in student loan debt -- and it is a growing menace to the health of America. But the federal government has continued to feed the beast because colleges may not to lead to jobs but do lead to many more Democratic voters. Democrats have hinted of future plans to wipe away the debt of college students --effectively transferring the debt to taxpayers. Michelle Obama recently urged high school students to grab as much taxpayer money as they can by applying for federal aid when they go to college. At T.C.Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia she told students that applying for federal student aid is easier than they think: \"Don't leave money on the table,\" Mrs. Obama said. \"Almost everyone is eligible for some form of financial aid, and all you have to do to access that aid is fill out this one little form. It's so simple.\" \"Through FAFSA [Free Application for Federal Student Aid], the Department of Education provides more than $150 billion every year in low-interest loans, in grants that you don't have to pay back, and work study programs that can help cover your educational expenses,\" As Dr. Susan Berry wrote at Big Government: Mrs. Obama, however, emphasized that there are \"thousands of dollars to help you and your family pay for college,\" and that students could receive federal aid regardless of how well they perform in school or even if their families are not at poverty level. \"You don't have to be the valedictorian. You don't have to major in a certain subject,\" the First Lady said. \"You don't even have to be at the very bottom of the income ladder to receive the money...\" Yet student loan defaults continue to skyrocket. One day the bubble will burst and Republicans will be handed the blame. If the clichÃ© that insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result is true, then the Obama administration is certifiable (that's okay since mental health care is covered by Obamacare and by the time he finishes his second term many Americans will be seeking mental health professionals). Obama's pick to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, former Congressman Mel Watt, has made clear his intention to spend taxpayer dollars to help otherwise unqualified home buyers to purchase homes. Formerly, one had to work and get a good credit rating to be able to take out a mortgage and purchase a home. Not anymore. There is a new sheriff in town and he is not interested in enforcing reasonable and sound credit standards and rules . The administration is also pressuring banks, and cities to make it far easier for people to buy cars and homes -- regardless of how sensible and sustainable such purchases and loans may be or how solid the job prospects are for purchasers. Obama has used his executive authority to gut workfare -- one of the great bipartisan reform efforts over the years to transform welfare and get people off the government dole and into the workforce. Barack Obama also subtly changed the federal definition of \"poverty\" so that many people on welfare don't have to \"worry\" about being dropped from the welfare rolls, secure in the knowledge that the checks from taxpayers will continue to flow. So when Republicans declare their goal is to grow the economy and create more jobs and thus more taxpayers, they lose the loafer vote. And when Democrats are in the forefront of legalizing marijuana even for non-medical purposes they gain the loafer vote. As the liberal Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus wrote: \"...persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline broadly across domains of functioning, even after controlling for years of education.\" Long-term users saw an average decline of eight IQ points. Once again, teenage toking was the problem. The decrease in IQ was linked only to those with adolescent marijuana use, not those who started in adulthood Lassitude, lethargy and lack of motivation follow -- sounds like a drug tailor-made for loafers. Barack Obama was a member of the Choom Gang in his fancy Hawaii high-school. One wonders if those effects can persist? Didn't Obama make clear he was all out for the loafer vote -- and that his goal was to create another class in America, the loafer class? After all, wasn't his animated campaign pitch \"The Life of Julia\" celebrating cradle to grave dependency on big government (the role of taxpayers was left on the cutting room floor)? As Ethel Fenig wrote on American Thinker: Julia would attend a government school complete with Head Start, go on to a government college thanks to government funds, start a business with government help, birth and raise a child supplemented with government funds and finally retire to a happy, healthy old age with her living and health care expenses all paid for with government funds. Isn't Julia's perfect match, Pajama Boy, a poster child for the loafer life: lolling about in PJs, sipping hot chocolate, advocating Obamacare at Thanksgiving instead of, say, talking about his job? Rich Lowry wrote in \"Pajama Boy, An Insufferable Man-Child\" about Julia and PJ Boy: But it's hard not to see Pajama Boy as an expression of the Obama vision, just like his forbear Julia, the Internet cartoon from the 2012 campaign. Pajama Boy is Julia's little brother. She progressed through life without any significant family or community connections. He is the picture of perpetual adolescence. Neither is a symbol of self-reliant, responsible adulthood. And so both are ideal consumers of government. Julia needed the help of Obama-supported programs at every juncture of her life, and Pajama Boy is going to get his health insurance through Obamacare (another image shows him looking very pleased in a Christmas sweater, together with the words \"And a happy New Year with health insurance\"). The breakdown of marriage and its drift into the 30s mean there are more Julias and Pajama Boys than ever. The growth of government feeds off this trend, and at the margins, augments it. In other words, they are loafers. But wouldn't Pajama Boy, though androgynous in a metrosexual way, be more suited as Julia's mate? Barbie had Ken; Eve had Adam. Addicted to Other People's Money, mainlined by Democrats, hooked at an early age they could have the politically correct two children and raise them as True Believers in Big Brother. Brave New World! President Obama has broken many promises. One that he has not broken is his boast that he would \"fundamentally transform America.\" He and his fellow Democrats are on the verge of doing just that by turning us into a nation of loafers. A loafer is an idle person who lives off others. Barack Obama seemingly has no problem with such people. He might even relate to them. He does have a serious problem with his own work ethic, and finds work boring. He also denigrates the work of others who build businesses through dint of hard work and risk-taking (\"You didn't build that\"); talks incessantly of \"fat cats\" on Wall Street; embraced the Occupy Wall Street Movement of squatters and pumped up their own inflated self-importance by telling them \"You are the reason I ran for office\"; and accuses doctors of running up the tab by, among other evils, taking tonsils out for money instead of diagnosing problems as allergies). He has yet to speak critically of union leaders, class action lawyers and others who run up the tab for all Americans because they are, after all, the Democratic Base. But Obama and his Democratic Party allies seem to be gleeful about the rise of the loafer class. Recent revelations from the Congressional Budget Office bear witness to this phenomenon. When the CBO's prognosis on the future of Obamacare revealed that the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs would be lost because the provisions of the law would create disincentives to working (as well as hiring) what was the response from the left side of the political spectrum? Investor's Business Daily listed a few of them in The Left's Lamest Defense of ObamaCare Yet: Jason Furman, Obama's Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, also tried to spin these projected job losses into good news by saying ObamaCare would allow workers greater \"choice.\" Furman said, \"This is not businesses cutting back on jobs. This is people having new choices.\" If taxpayer-funded health insurance encourages some people to work less, \"that, in their case, might be a better choice and a better option that what they had before.\" Then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi unwittingly revealed this goal years ago in a comment that unsurprisingly got little airplay in the mainstream media when she toasted the fact that the health care reform that she and her fellow Democrats forced down America's throat would be a godsend for the \"creative class\": Think of an economy where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance. Yes...think about it! The lady from San Francisco does not think about the plumbers, contractors, accountants, sanitation workers and legions of other Morlocks toiling away for the benefit of artistic Elois and their patrons. Maybe performers can be hired to entertain government bureaucrats during over-the-top government junkets, or for IRS training films, or sculpt artwork that can be sold at outrageous prices to grace American embassies across the world for the delectation of Obama donors-ambassadors. Well, these people's choice to work less in order to qualify for subsidies to pay their health insurance premiums means that other people are paying for their liberation from work and from the responsibilities of being an adult and an American (at least what used to be considered an American). But such a goal is very attractive for loafers. ObamaCare also makes it very appealing for children to be coddled by their parents. Instead of becoming fully-functioning adults, paying their own way in the world, they can stay under their parents' insurance policies until the age of 26-further reducing the incentive to mature out of loafer-dom. Paul Ryan noted this sad state of affairs at the Republican National Convention: College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life. More 27-year olds are living in their parents' basements than with roommates-and this is true for college graduates, as well. But what if the Democratic Party does not want them to be anything other than loafers? That can be a very appealing prospect for many people. After all, Obama telegraphed his goal in 2008, making a Kinsley gaffe (a politician accidentally telling the truth) when he went off the teleprompter and told Joe the Plumber that his goal was to \"spread the wealth.\" How have Obama and his fellow Democrats achieved that goal? Count the ways: Endless extensions of unemployment insurance to anesthetize jobless Americans from the pain of reckless Democratic anti-growth policies; Record high food stamp usage; A record number on disability were getting the highest-ever monthly benefits; Labor Force participation rates have declined; people not in the labor force are at a record 91.8 million; Democrats are encouraging people to get on the government dole at an early age. High-school students are constantly exhorted to go to college. John Kerry typified the view of liberals when he told a crowd of Ohio voters: You know, education, if you make the most of it, if you study hard and you do your homework, and you make an effort to be smart, uh, you, you can do well. If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq. Barack Obama has repeatedly said that he thinks everyone should go to college -- seemingly oblivious to the reality that college may not be appropriate for everyone. Millions of people have come out of college with degrees that do not lead to jobs but have led to unsupportable debt loads.

Even with the best of intentions, the odds are not in our favor to successfully counter the Democrat-Media Complex, the educational system, and pop culture. That doesn’t mean there aren’t success stories (some in my own family), but I hear more about the failure and the disaffection it engenders in conservative families. Conservative parents have learned the hard way that how your kids turn out depends on a host of factors that, at some point during the maturation process, are way beyond our control -- friends, personal experiences, a particular book or documentary, brain chemistry, friends, a teacher/professor/boss, personality, a romantic relationship, college activities, pop culture, hobbies, and…friends. Usually, it’s not one but an amalgamation of several factors and presto chango! The kid who was once the lone conservative arguing at the lunch table, now thinks David Hogg and AOC are bitchin’. We see them everywhere -- the emaciated college-age vegans working at Starbucks, hysterical young girls pounding on Supreme Court doors, attractive anti-Semites leading the charge in Congress. I’m sure some of them had conservative upbringings -- you cannot assume they were all raised by liberals. Yet, in her reporting about out-of-control liberal college students some time ago, I heard Laura Ingraham link their behavior to their upbringing. Only a parent whose children hadn’t yet attended high school could make such an absurd connection. We can try but we cannot guarantee what our children will believe. Once again, I find myself referencing Red Scare movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It resonates. We have to be vigilant, stay informed, understand the arguments of the other side and how to combat them. If we don’t, eventually the pods take us over. I graduated high school a Reagan Republican whose political arguments were admittedly my Dad’s. When I arrived at a competitive college filled with smart, often private-school educated Merit scholars, I lost every political debate. I just didn’t have the breadth of information and understanding of history to counter their arguments. Thus, I graduated college…a Democrat. In time, I fell back on those critical thinking skills my parents instilled in me. A desire to understand more as I graduated from law school and entered the work force, led me to self-educate and, eventually, return to my conservative roots. That was also in the ‘80s and early ‘90s when life was simpler and more balanced: when “gay marriage” was still an oxymoron; before triggers and safe spaces, the internet, social media, doom and gloom “climate change,” and legalized pot; before we had an alphabet of sexualities to choose from and the ability to change sexes; before blended families became the norm; before hatred became the quintessential reason for all of society’s ills. Not all teachers and professors were proselytizing progressives, the media was less corrupt, and your politics were not a factor in getting or retaining a job. Because of the deep societal changes since then, not every Millennial or Gen Xer has the wherewithal, the background, or the backbone to recognize and then punch back against the forces of propaganda, fess up to and toil with their own ignorance, or simply engage in respectful debate with those who have another point of view -- no matter how steeped in conservatism their childhood. I am not suggesting we stop lecturing our children about competing points of view, stop teaching them to be skeptical about what they learn in school or from their peers, or stop challenging the false orthodoxies they are barraged with on virtually every topic from sexuality to climate, energy to food, and national security to border security. We should continue to bang the drum. We must. And we must remain hopeful that someday those we lost will return to the conservative fold because they see the wisdom of conservative principles. But for all of you young parents out there who think you’ll do better than those before you, be prepared for disappointment. The conservative path is littered with the bodies of well-intentioned parents who are devastated when their formerly straight kids come out of imaginary closets, transition to the opposite sex, or demand to be called “they”; when their Jewish Day School educated children announce their support for the BDS movement; when their evangelical children support blatant infanticide; when their happy, well-adjusted kids go off to college and return believing weed is innocuous, struggling with drug addiction, or suffering from mental illness. These cultural maladies affect liberals and conservatives alike, but are unusually bitter pills for conservatives to swallow because they are packaged in a lifestyle and value system antithetical to everything we teach our children -- resilience, pride, integrity, honesty, open-mindedness, self-reliance, individuality, taking responsibility for our actions, doing right when we screw up, and teaching a man to fish. Liberals cast us as hypocrites whose principles clash with reality, but what they don’t understand is that we believe in taking responsibility for and learning from our missteps so we constantly evolve into better beings (and don’t get mired in unbridled, misplaced hatred and lifelong victimhood).Secondly, conservative parents are treated by their children with a level of hostility that doesn’t seem to afflict liberal parents with conservative children. Loving, nurturing conservative parents find themselves catapulted to Holocaust-denier status and demoted to homophobic, intolerant, racist, privileged, religious zealots. Relics of an oppressive past. It is painful when your kids reject everything you raised them to value. Despise you. Scoff at you. Turn against you. Align with your political foes. Resent you for brainwashing them with your hateful, 1950‘s agenda. Now, some of that is typical teenage/young adult angst and rebellion. When frontal lobes are soothed by the right combination of hormones and our insecure little monsters segue into more confident adults, those nasty side effects often dissipate. But much of the antipathy they are exposed to is encouraged by “the man” in the liberal camp -- we’ll call him “the burning man.” He instructs us to hate authority, hate anything established, hate tradition, hate the moral code you grew up with, hate anyone who is white or successful, and hate those who embrace any of this. Hence, hate your parents. Hate your old neighborhood. They are the problem. And while today all you have to do is oppose them, someday you might have to actively go against them, even “turn them in.” The burning man says this is okay because you are right and the end justifies the means. I’m not being paranoid. Our entire educational system is based on appropriating the minds of our children and undoing all they have learned at home, turning them into weapons of mass societal destruction in the burning man’s toolbox. We have all participated in holiday dinners and family vacations ruined by dissension and door-slamming. Family harmony devolves into family discord, function into dysfunction, and closeness morphs into estrangement. Parents are instructed to just shut up already! Politics and religion are off the table. Dinner conversations revolve around silly cat videos and trivial drivel. Soon there is little left to discuss. After all, everything is political now -- from your sneakers to your bus commute during Pride Month. Once upon a time, we could fall back on cultural interests like music, movies, theater, travel, and sports to avoid potentially explosive conversations at family gatherings about politics and religion. Now, virtue signaling is so ubiquitous that everything seems to fall into the Realm of the verboten. It becomes more and more difficult to find common ground. Constructive input I like your haircut and simple questions Did you decide on a major? What are you doing for break? How do you like your job? are potential triggers. Family get togethers are so contentious there is an increasing tendency to minimize interactions. Even life’s big “hatching, matching, and dispatching” events are often fraught with tension -- relatives who couldn’t be seated together because of some family squabble are now separated because one has a worldview the other finds detestable.Some parents give in. They don’t want politics or values to stand in the way of their relationships with their kids, so they re-visit their Weltanschauung. Constant pressure from your 20-year-old bubelah goes a long way towards re-educating Mom and Dad. Senator Rob Portman was against gay marriage until his son came out and then… he evolved. I’d rather fight than switch is a paean to another time. This is nothing new. Many parents drank the Kool-Aid and became part of the 60s counterculture their children brought home. Ironically, many of their hippie children became yuppies and did the unthinkable -- morphed into their conservative parents. Hmm. I suppose we can be clear-eyed about the transformative societal and political forces pulling our children away from conservatism, at the same time we cling to the hope that our liberal progeny will switch and fight for conservative principles and maybe even cling to their bibles and the Constitution, too. I am skeptical that our efforts as conservative parents to produce conservative offspring will materialize.

I suppose we can be clear-eyed about the transformative societal and political forces pulling our children away from conservatism, at the same time we cling to the hope that our liberal progeny will switch and fight for conservative principles and maybe even cling to their bibles and the Constitution, too.",

Affordable health care is now turning into quite for a challenge for those who made a lot of promises. They told us that taxes would go up on the rich. Not really. They told us that you could keep your insurance or that your employer-based coverage would not be impacted. Again, not really. We are now learning that employers are reacting to Obama-Care by reducing payrolls or turning some full time employees into part timers: \"The mandate to offer health insurance doesn't take effect until 2014, but the \"measurement period\" used by the feds to determine a firm's average number of full-time employees started last month. So the cutbacks and employment dodges are underway. \" (WSJ) So how did we miss all of this? How did so many people who voted for this get it wrong? First, and most important, they didn't read it or hold hearings to \"weed out\" the fantasy from reality. Do you recall a hearing where fast-food restaurant owners were invited to react to the law? Second, no one in the media challenged the premise that you can cover everyone by just raising taxes on the rich. We can blame that on \"media bias\" but I think that it was more of \"economics\" ignorance on the part of the people who cover our news. Third, and don't underestimate this, many Democrats voted for health care thinking that The Supreme Court would bail them out. After Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts spoiled their plan, they just bet on a Romney victory and a partial or full repeal. What happens next? We will have one train-wreck after another. By the summer of 2014, Obama Care will be so unpopular that most Democrats will start running from it. What do we do? First, hold the Democrats accountable. They voted for it.

Apparently, all it took was one Mexican police raid and the caravan signups have just about vanished.Here's the rather amazing Associated Press story: Calls for a new migrant caravan went largely unheeded Tuesday as a relatively small group departed from Honduras, a week after a raid by Mexican police resulted in hundreds of detentions and the dissolution of a previous caravan. Conversation in online chat groups used to organize the caravans has been marked by anxiety since the raid and amid other policies in Mexico that seem designed to discourage movements of migrants en masse. Fewer than 300 people gathered at a bus station in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, to leave by bus and on foot in the overnight darkness. Caravans tend to grow as they move north and are joined by migrants already on the road, but the group was a far cry from previous caravans that began with around 1,000-2,000 people. The caravan that was broken up last week numbered around 3,000 at its peak. So apparently all it took was word of a police raid along swift and certain deportation and the migrants decided to stay away. Among illegal migrants, word gets around fast. They know the migrant journey is arduous. They know the Mexican public has gotten sick of the side effects of their arrivals - littering, crime, costs of food and board, and disruption. The tipping point seems to have been the raids, from the officials who will no longer stand by idly and let them do it. As a result, migrating legally to the U.S. has just gotten a little bit more attractive, and some would-be migrants will undoubtedly consider other Latin countries for new residences as better alternatives. It's amazing stuff, given that the raid was actually quite piddly, and the numbers of illegal migrants moving toward the U.S. are absolutely huge. It's actually a favor to nations such as Honduras and El Salvador, which right now can't afford to lose people based on their demographic decline.It shows just how risk-free the proposition of illegal immigration has been for those seeking to come here illegally. Up until now, it's always been something for nothing - and people falsely claiming asylum don't even have to pay fees for their phony claims, quite unlike legal immigrants. Well, that little move from the Mexicans seems to have shifted the equation, creating a bit of balance. Credit for that goes not to Mexico, but to President Trump, who only got Mexico to act by threatening to shut down the border if the Mexicans didn't act to halt the caravans. The Mexicans may well have thought their tiny raid would be good for symbolic argument's sake, a token act to get Trump off their backs, but now that we see this result, something more is going on: Trump's tweets seem to be having the effect of walls.Image credit: Fox News, via YouTube, screen shot Who says human beings, Central American, Mexican, or North American, don't respond to incentives?

And he wants the perpetrators punished. According to the Daily Caller, Paul tweeted: “Yesterday there was an attempt to incite people by publishing the personal information of Senators – including home addresses – endangering them & their families,” the Kentucky Republican tweeted. “This should be investigated & the perpetrators punished. There is too much hatred and violence in politics these days.” As usual, Paul is onto something. Already the Democrats and their supporters have a disturbing pattern of threats and violence against Republicans and they've been getting away with it easily, as each news cycle moves on to the next story. As the left's rage escalates, it's likely there is no end to it in sight. Some examples: The near murder of Rep. Steve Scalise shot on a baseball field by a crazed Bernie Sanders supporter with a gun. The heinous assault on Paul himself by a crazed leftist neighbor, leaving him with injured lungs and at least five broken ribs, along with the astonishingly light sentence this violent brute got. The open plotting of violence and assassinations against Republicans by leftist communist thugs, in the wake of a long series of antifa vandalisms at universities over conservative speakers. The restaurant mob chaseout of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, led by a Department of Justice employee acting in consort with her Democratic Socialists of America cohorts. The restaurant chaseout of White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders by a crazed leftwing restaurant owner who apparently followed her party to the next restaurant to keep protesting. The restaurant chaseout of Sen. Ted Cruz by a leftist mob over his support for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The stalking and harassing of Rep. Devin Nunes by an apparently leftist weirdo still unknown. It's so bad, it sounds like these Democrats and leftists won't be satisfied until there is a civil war. Their sense of entitlement to power, and their Ayers-like 'by any means necessary' ethos, as well as the specter of their long reign as the establishment ending, has got to be driving this. Now we have the doxxing scandal, as if there is no such thing as Democratic-aligned mobs willing to do what Democrats are thinking. And amid this lengthening pattern of leftist violence, a very weak response. Rep. Maxine Waters' office has been accused of this crime based on an IP number traceable to her office, and as she has with her calls to violence against Republicans, she denies it happened, although she didn't provide any refuting proof. Unless she does, it sounds as though she is trying to escape some kind of responsibility. It's serious, as Paul notes, because the left's record of unpunished violence is lengthening. Whoever did the doxxing, Waters or not, needs to be held accountable. If Republicans stand for rule of law in contrast to their Democratic colleagues, they need to show it.

AP writers can use the term when necessary to refer to the law, but should do so sparingly. NPR, which is partially funded by your tax dollars, is also avoiding the term \"Obamacare,\" but is just fine with the ACA formulation. Drew Zahn of World Net Daily writes: At at NPR, Stuart Seidel, managing editor for standards and practices, announced in a memo ruling earlier this week that reporters should cut back on use of the term. \"'Obamacare' seems to be straddling somewhere between being a politically-charged term and an accepted part of the vernacular.

Polling demonstrates that when the law is called the ACA, it generates far more support than when it is called Obamacare. Jonah Goldberg, writing in USA Today: CNBC polled two different groups, using \"ObamaCare\" for one and \"Affordable Care Act\" for the other. Forty-six percent of the group asked about \"ObamaCare\" opposed it. But only 37% of those asked about the health law opposed it. Conversely, ObamaCare had higher support than the law.

This means that NPR is explicitly favoring a term that the public does not understand over one the public does understand.

Biden said Democrats, “Choose truth over facts.” But he is neither the sharpest tool on the tree nor the brightest bulb in the shed. Or was it a Freudian slip? The left believes they can prescribe the “truth,” by proscribing facts. In controlling what is the “truth,” they seek to define the present and establish the nation’s “true” history in order to use this history to dictate our future. It used to be the “big lie,” emphatically told often enough to become “truth.” In this age of instant information, expediency necessitates a thousand little lies echoed by the progressive oligarchy through its components, the Democrats, media, academia, entertainment, big tech, and big finance. They lie to preclude admitting the GOP came within tens of thousands of votes from controlling both houses of the legislature and the presidency, while Republicans still control a majority of governorships and statehouses. Joe Biden does not have a “mandate” because Americans do not want the country transformed into a progressive globalist paradise. It is inevitable our frotteur president will rub people the wrong way (pun intended) with his economy-killing policies and depart the presidency with historic unpopularity. A Multitudinous but Noncomprehensive List of their Lies Trump is a white supremacist; he admitted so with Charlottesville. Trump incited an insurrection on January 6th in an attempted coup. Impeachment was not solely intended to preclude something Trump might do in 2024, by convicting him of something he did not do in 2021. Climate change is an existential crisis that requires the elite to have total control. People desire and demand oligarchic rule because rule by correct-thinking “experts” is “democracy in action.” Riots by Antifa/BLM were “mostly peaceful” demonstrations while the mostly peaceful protest on January 6th was not only a riot but also a coup. Ashli Babbitt was not assassinated by an officer shooting from a hidden position when she was not a threat. Her mere presence was violence warranting her death. Censorship protects “free speech,” and CNN is a news organization. Lockdowns and masks work with such efficaciousness the nation needs more of both in this “dark winter” of Biden’s discontent. Silence is violence; inaction is racism. The election was not stolen. Eighty million people voted for Joe Biden who is not in the grips of senescent senility hiding in the basement of the White House surrounded by his new Praetorian (nee National) Guard. Executive Orders are a legitimate way to change the Constitution and the nation. America needs a 9/11-style investigation and a Truth Commission where conservatives can confess their sins. Where We Stand If intent is the difference between manslaughter and murder, our elite has murdered truth. Biden is the front man for an oligarchy trying to eliminate the constitution and destroy the republic. Oligarchists are deliberately pushing the nation to the brink of true insurrection and violence. They act with impunity because they believe Americans who oppose them are an impotent, flaccid majority. Why shouldn’t they believe this? They stole a presidential election, and then Molly Ball bragged about it in Time magazine. Biden has issued scores of economy-destroying diktats and thrown open our borders to millions of un-COVID tested illegal aliens without any repercussions. Progressives, however, have not displayed the level of competence necessary for them to succeed. The Fight Begins Americans must begin to “fight like hell, or we are not going to have a country.” This is not a call to sedition. Americans must take a pledge to forgo violence. Use Our Voices Phone calls, letters, emails, essays, and verbal confrontations will be an integral part of this fight. In confrontations, however, keeping our distance is paramount -- we are not Democrats. If we see these usurpers “in a restaurant, in a department store, or in a gasoline station,” we do not “get in their faces” and “push back.” We make our voices heard from a nonthreatening distance (10 feet or more); we do not approach them. We call out their lies and treachery, stay no more than a minute or two and leave. We never threaten them, never approach their families, never go to their homes. Use Our Bodies We must organize into a new “Trump” Tea Party because he is either our 47th president or a kingmaker. Trump must declare for 2024 to keep raising money for rallies and to organize his tens of millions of supporters. Trump is our shadow president. He will purchase or start his own network. As a businessman with 75 million followers and no lack of conservatives to host shows, he could make another billion dollars. He should utilize new media: Parler, MeWe, and Gab. Millions will follow. We must peacefully protest every action of Joe Biden. Issue-specific rallies supporting the 2nd Amendment, and jobs and growth over the Green New Deal will be great fundraising weapons and organizing tools. The oligarchy, of course, will unleash their Antifa/BLM paramilitary upon us so all rallies should be held where paid security and a police presence are feasible. Use Our Checkbooks We should donate money to “Trump 2024” and absolutely only to those politicians who have not sold out, like Cruz, Hawley, Gaetz, Cotton, Jordan, et al.

Biden said Democrats, “Choose truth over facts.” But he is neither the sharpest tool on the tree nor the brightest bulb in the shed. Or was it a Freudian slip? The left believes they can prescribe the “truth,” by proscribing facts. In controlling what is the “truth,” they seek to define the present and establish the nation’s “true” history in order to use this history to dictate our future. It used to be the “big lie,” emphatically told often enough to become “truth.” In this age of instant information, expediency necessitates a thousand little lies echoed by the progressive oligarchy through its components, the Democrats, media, academia, entertainment, big tech, and big finance. They lie to preclude admitting the GOP came within tens of thousands of votes from controlling both houses of the legislature and the presidency, while Republicans still control a majority of governorships and statehouses.

        "articles": "The heartening success of Mark Levin's The Liberty Amendments has brought to the fore the long-standing debate over the unused second half of the Constitution's Article V. This allows two thirds of the States to require Congress to issue a call for a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution. This convention would act in place of the two-thirds vote in Congress by which all amendments to the Constitution to date have been initiated (in both cases amendments then have to be approved by three quarters of the States). Unfortunately, such a convention has never been successfully held, nor is one likely. However, this does not mean that we have to abandon all hope of using amendment to restore our lost Constitution. The solution is to first reform the amendment process to allow the States to directly amend the Constitution, without having to go though the untried and archaic mechanism of a convention. Many constitutional conservatives have long opposed using the state-called convention method for initiating an amendment proposal. Mark Levin used to be among these, and the estimable Phyllis Schlafly has continued to lay out the case against the convention method. Perhaps the most prominent opponent of the convention method was James Madison, who warned the 1787 Constitutional Convention that \"difficulties might arise as to the form, the quorum &c., which in Constitutional regulations ought to be as much as possible avoided.\" Madison very much favored the idea that the States should be able to initiate constitutional amendments, but accurately foresaw that this lack of procedural specificity for an Article V convention would doom any attempt to use that mechanism to achieve them. The numerous possible procedural disputes over an Article V convention include such critical issues as how votes will be allocated and what percentage of votes will be required for the convention to act (more detail can be found here.) Many, particularly Professor Robert Natelson, have done prodigious research on the original meaning of the convention clause to answer these objections. However, modern politicians and judges are unmoved by the original meaning of the Constitution. That is largely why we are in our current tragic mess. Without getting into the detail of the potential disputes over the procedures for an Article V convention, it is certain that, even if two thirds of the States were to call for a convention, it would be tied up in litigation for years. And if it was ever able to convene, it would likely turn out to be the largest convocation of leftist law professors ever assembled, who would dominate the media coverage and assure that no amendments would issue which would accomplish anything sought by constitutional conservatives. And yet, it is increasingly clear to many constitutional conservatives that the retail solution of electing supposedly conservative politicians and promoting the appointment of supposedly conservative judges is completely inadequate to push the federal leviathan back into its constitutional limits. Amendment offers the only wholesale solution, and the only remaining peaceful solution, to restoring our Republic. Mark Levin points the way out of this dilemma, although he does not seem to fully recognize its potency. In chapter 9 of The Liberty Amendments he proposes an amendment providing that two thirds of the States be allowed to directly amend the Constitution without having to go through a congressionally summoned convention. As he succinctly notes \"there is no persuasive reason the states need to administratively organize their amendment efforts through Congress\" (page 166). A similar but more detailed proposal which addresses other historical difficulties with the amendment process and includes certain features to attract progressive support can be found here. Instead of investing precious resources in promoting the call of a convention which would be unlikely to occur, and be equally unlikely to produce anything worthwhile even if it did occur, constitutional conservatives would do better to promote the enactment of an \"amendment amendment\" which would permit the States to directly amend the Constitution. Then grassroots efforts could be launched to pass Levin's Liberty Amendments and other measures to restore our Constitution. Other worthwhile proposals might include those by Georgetown law professor Randy Barnett, Texas independent scholar Jon Roland (who with over 70 distinct proposals is the numerical champ of conservative reformers) and perhaps some of my own. Of course, how does one enact an amendment to eliminate the convention requirement for state initiated amendments without still having to go through the sturm und drang of a convention? It is my contention that such an Amendment Amendment can be initiated by the traditional method of two-thirds vote of Congress. Now, why would Congress initiate an amendment proposal that would eliminate its de facto monopoly on that power, and why would Democrats vote for an amendment proposal which would open the possibility of constitutional amendments to restrict the power of the federal government? The answer is that Democrats, or at least the real progressives among them, have their own amendments which they want to push. Leading the list is one to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision allowing more political free speech by incorporated groups like unions and businesses. That none of the numerous proposals introduced in Congress to do this has gone anywhere presents a powerful argument for them to support opening a new path to amendment. I recognize that many readers of the American Thinker will find the idea of a short-term political alliance with progressives deeply distasteful, especially since their motive is to overturn a rare Supreme Court decision which reduced government control of free speech. However, any realistic chance of getting two thirds of the States to issue a convention call will require Democrat support. This will be especially difficult if the convention call is one limited to a conservative purpose like a balanced budget amendment. The political chances of such support are much better for a content-neutral proposal like direct state amendment. And I would dearly love to run the campaign against any member of Congress (or state legislator) who would oppose moving amendment power closer to the people. \"So Representative or Senator Power-to-the-People, how do you explain your vote against actually restoring control over the Constitution to \"We, the People\" other than rank hypocrisy and your hopeless entanglement in the corrupt Washington power structure?\" Most constitutional conservatives believe that we cannot wait any longer. I, for one, do not want to wait until my country collapses to try to restore the free nation our Founders gave us. Amending the Constitution to allow direct state amendment is our best hope of restoring our Republic in, to use George Mason's words at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, \"an easy, regular, Constitutional way [rather] than to trust to chance and violence.\" James W.

        "articles": "Last year, in the run-up to the elections, the drive-by media began demonizing Marjorie Taylor Greene, a first-time House candidate in Georgia. She was castigated as a QAnon crazy and all sorts of other things. Despite these attacks, Greene won with a resounding 75% of her district's votes. Tucker Carlson recently spent an hour talking to Greene, and I came away impressed. The only downside is that the interview is on Fox Nation, so if you're not already a member, you need to set up a trial membership to hear her. I must admit that I was already inclined to like Greene before I heard her speak. First, if the Democrat operatives in the media were attacking her with such ferocity, they clearly feared her. That intrigued me. Second, from the moment she hit D.C., she refused to let the Democrats intimidate her. Third, I read very carefully through her draft America First plan and thought it was a great statement of classically liberal and constitutional principles. The fact that the Vichy Republicans attacked her for it pretty much summed up the disgrace of the GOP. If you check out Greene's website, you'll discover a woman who has no respect for the D.C. establishment. In that regard, she aligns perfectly with those GOP voters whom Frank Luntz ignores when he whispers sweet Democrat-lite nothings in Rep. Kevin McCarthy's ears at night in their shared D.C. apartment. She's not the conservative wing of the Democrat party, as is the case for most D.C. Republicans. Instead, she is promoting a classical, pro-American agenda. That's why I carved out time to listen to Tucker Carlson's interview with her. The interview is on Fox Nation, which is a members-only service. A word about Fox Nation: I subscribed to it during 2020 when I was sucking up election news...and then ignored it completely. It just didn't have stuff that interested me. I tried to cancel my subscription after Fox's disgraceful performance on Election Night, when their Democrat-run election desk team worked to hand the election to Biden. I'm still furious about that. Fox Nation, however, has a \"no refund\" policy, so I couldn't put my anger into action by canceling my subscription. Having said that, I like Tucker Carlson. I find him witty and funny. He highlights stories I won't hear on other stations, and he bores me less than watching the other talking heads. This year, Carlson's expanded his platform so that, instead of just having Tucker Carlson Tonight, he has two other shows: an interview show during which he has hour-long conversations with people who don't necessarily get a platform elsewhere and a show in which he does long-form investigations into interesting stories. Both these shows are only on Fox Nation. During this past week, I watched two Tucker shows on Fox Nation that I highly recommend. The first was a 23-minute-long look at what Soros D.A. Kim Foxx has done to Chicago. Essentially, she's stopped prosecuting crime. The footage Tucker's team assembled for the episode is shocking. It shows a city that's gone completely feral. Too many Chicago residents have no internal moral compass, and Foxx has ensured that they need fear only each other, not the city's criminal justice system. And then, yesterday, I watched Tucker's interview with Greene and thought, \"Wow. This is an awesome politician.\" Greene is a remarkably self-assured woman with a business background. About Congress, she says what we've long suspected: most congresspeople have accomplished nothing practical in life. They've worked for the government or as employees. They've never managed anything. Worse, the Republicans have as their goal to be liked and to get re-elected, while the Democrats have victory as their goal. Greene is not intimidated by either Republicans or Democrats, although she admires Democrat tactics — especially Nancy Pelosi's and AOC's. One of Greene's most interesting points is that she keeps being told not to bring up controversial bills because they won't pass. As a businesswoman, she says that's idiotic. You start selling the bills now so that when you do regain power, you've already seeded the ground. Of course, Republicans, once elected, invariably bail on their prior promises. In a way, listening to Greene, it seems she's instantly become the Jiminy Cricket of Congress: a voice that should be the Republican Party's conscience, telling them not all the nice platitudes they want to hear, but the realities that they need to hear about winning. Her goal — and one for which she's willing to fight — is to save America as a constitutional, classically liberal, economically successful, colorblind nation that does not think it's sane to mutilate children either chemically or surgically. If I could change just one thing about her, I'd tell her that the expression is \"I couldn't care less,\" not \"I could care less.\" Oh, and I might recommend a different haircut. Here's Tucker's preview of his interview with Greene: If you're inclined to try the trial membership at Fox Nation, you can sign up here. While you're there, check out the report on Chicago. Remember, though, that if you don't want to spend the big bucks for a full subscription, you've got to calendar canceling that trial membership. Image: Marjorie Taylor Greene. YouTube screen grab.

The question of what motivates Democrats and what their values are has bedeviled me for years, since I have friends and family who are Democrats. If the government was not so big and controlling it would be less of an issue, but I find decisions I would make overruled by Democrats in power. My family and I end up paying for their mistakes on top of our own. We work hard, save as much as we can, invest in the future, and find out we have the ever-grasping government as partners who can render our efforts useless. Regulations and the overseers who impose them on us add to my misery, as do tax forms that are needlessly complicated and filled with loopholes that the rich can afford to exploit. I find the fruits of our labor are harvested and enjoyed by others. I see the Constitution trampled to advance agendas I do not share. Free speech is all too often rejected as “hate speech” while watchers for “trigger words” are all too ready to censor the speech of others. I see unions corrupt politics and teachers’ unions protect their interests and the future of their pensions over protecting the future of our children we place in their care. The work ethic is being eviscerated. People who build things are derided by President Obama as having not built things or dismissed as “lottery winners.” Doctors do not heal, they are greedy people who yank out tonsils and lop off legs solely for profit -- or so says the Democrats’ leader, Barack Obama, and the Democrats who cheer him. People who work in finance are “fat cats” and “one- percenters” who must be “toppled” -- or so sayeth the one percent of one percenter, Hillary Clinton, probably the most hypocritical person in America. Why do Democrats worship her? So I have come to just throw my hands in the air and ask, “What is wrong with Democrats?” Let’s begin the inquiry. Why do Democrats embrace Al Sharpton, an anti-white anti-Semite, liar, con man hustler who extorts millions from corporations and who is a habitual tax cheat? He has received a lot of attention lately, not because of his carnivalesque talk show on MSNBC that few watch, but because Barack Obama has appointed and anointed him as his point man on race. The riots in Ferguson and Baltimore and the tragic death of Eric Garner are fuel for Al Sharpton (he may not need much food in the wake of his bariatric surgery but he needs riots and mayhem -- and when they aren’t there, he creates them). But he has been welcomed by Democrats for many years. Heather MacDonald wrote about the Democratic Embrace of Al Sharpton last year after his birthday was celebrated by, among others, the leading luminaries of the Democratic Party: The Democratic establishment is just as obsequious. It turned out in force earlier this month to celebrate Mr. Sharpton’s 60th birthday party at New York’s tony Four Seasons restaurant. Hillary Clinton phoned in with best wishes. Barack and Michelle Obama sent a congratulatory letter. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo gushed: “He’s the nation’s Rev. Sharpton—and the nation is better for it.” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Reps. Charles Rangel and Jerry Nadler rushed to pay their respects. (snip) For those who have forgotten or are too young to recall, here is a brief history of the man now so warmly embraced by the mayor, the governor and the president. There was Mr. Sharpton’s frenzied involvement in the Tawana Brawley case. In 1987 Ms. Brawley, a 15-year-old African-American, concocted a tale of being raped by six white males. The allegation was ultimately revealed as a hoax, but not before Mr. Sharpton had commandeered the racially incendiary story and poured fuel on it by accusing a white county prosecutor of having been among the attackers. The prosecutor, Steven Pagones, won a defamation suit in 1998 against Mr. Sharpton, Ms. Brawley and her lawyers. Mr. Sharpton refused to pay the judgment against him, which was eventually discharged by a group of supporters. In 1991 a Hasidic driver in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights accidentally ran onto a sidewalk and killed a 7-year-old black child named Gavin Cato. Mr. Sharpton led protesters in angry cries of “No justice, no peace,” criticized Jewish diamond merchants in the neighborhood for selling goods from apartheid South Africa, and spoke at a rally where a banner said, “Hitler did not do the job.” During three days of violence following the accident, rioters beat to death an Australian rabbinical student named Yankel Rosenbaum. In 1995 Mr. Sharpton led a protest in Harlem to stop a Jewish landlord—a “white interloper,” in Mr. Sharpton’s words—from evicting a black-operated record shop. One of the protesters would later set fire to the store, killing seven store employees. Mr. Sharpton has never apologized for his involvement in the Brawley hoax. Nor has he taken responsibility for his agitation in Crown Heights. In 2008 the Associated Press reported that Mr. Sharpton and his business entities owed nearly $1.5 million in taxes and penalties, as well as tens of thousands of dollars in fines for unpaid workers' compensation and unemployment insurance. By this year Mr. Sharpton’s tax liabilities had ballooned to $4.7 million. This is a man welcomed at State Dinners at the White House and who receives hugs and well-wishes from Bill and Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama has run roughshod over the Constitution and the separation of powers. Have Democrats in Congress who excoriated Richard Nixon for running an imperial presidency (he was a piker compared to Barack Obama) objected to the many examples of Obama violating important principles enshrined in our Constitution? This should not be a partisan issue and is not in doubt. He routinely loses in federal court -- except for Obamacare (that may be remedied somewhat by the Supreme Court in June on the topic of the availability of subsidies). Barack Obama routinely flunks the constitutional test and has racked up quite the losing score when it comes to federal courts who actually believe in the importance of upholding the law (most recently in checking, at least temporarily, his executive order regarding immigration). Have any Democrats registered any objections to his presidential overreach? Senators and representatives take an oath, as did President Obama, to defend and support the Constitution. They have not. In fact, they have done everything they can to promote the powers of the President since they assume Democrats have a lock on the presidency. They are Democrats for a Dictatorial Presidency, as I wrote a few months ago. People blame the IRS scandal on Lois Lerner. She is just a fall gal. Many Democrats, including powerful U.S. Senators and the president are to blame for siccing the IRS on political opponents. Kimberly Strassel wrote in the Wall Street Journal about the timeline of the scandal: Ms. Lerner's focus on shutting down Crossroads GPS came only after Obama adviser David Axelrod listed Crossroads among \"front groups for foreign-controlled companies\"; only after Senate Democrats Dick Durbin, Carl Levin, Chuck Schumer and others demanded the IRS investigate Crossroads; only after the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee launched a website to \"expose donors\" of Crossroads; and only after Obama's campaign lawyer, Bob Bauer, filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission about Crossroads. Democrats pushed the IRS to target Republicans; Richard Nixon was excoriated and faced impeachment for far less when it came to trying to use the IRS against a few political opponents -- and his critics included many Republicans. Have any Democrats objected to the use of the IRS for doing the “wet work” of the Democratic Party? What is wrong with Democrats? Of course, weaponizing the IRS is just part of a broader attempt to restrict the free speech of conservatives and Republicans. Barack Obama, as part of his broad assault on Fox News and conservative media, has called for a “change in how the media reports” the news. Hillary Clinton is seemingly a foe of the First Amendment when it comes to political opponents. She and fellow Democrats hate the Supreme Court’s 2009 Citizens United decision that upheld the right of free speech in politics. This decision was based on a film that criticized her. So Hillary has called for a constitutional amendment to prohibit such speech. As Investors Business Daily wrote in” Hillary’s Call to Change First Amendment’s Free Speech”: How is Hillary Clinton appealing to an ever-more-radical Democratic base? By talking up changing the First Amendment. What better way, after all, to end the political power of anti-Big Government forces? 'We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment.\" Have Democrats objected to her attack on the First Amendment? Liberals are supposed to be open to debate and animated by the exchange of ideas. But they seem more focused on the “Shut up, they explained” mode of discourse as I wrote last year and are supporting a candidate who would gut the right of free speech. What is wrong with Democrats? Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation have been mired in scandals lately (well, correct that, for many years), but the recent crop of scandals include the Benghazi disaster, pay for play actions at the Potemkin-like charity (really a political operation masquerading as a charity), the home-brewed server and email lies and tall tales exposure -- and more to come, no doubt. The Clintons have a long record pockmarked with corruption and other scandals, yet she has remained popular as ever among Democrats. The Wall Street Journal’s Janet Hook noted something disturbing: Hillary Clinton’s stature has been battered after more than a month of controversy over her fundraising and email practices, but support for her among Democrats remains strong and unshaken, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds. In just seven weeks, a period in which Mrs. Clinton formally began her presidential campaign, the share of people with a negative view of her jumped to 42% from 36% in last month’s survey, and only a quarter of registered voters said they viewed her as honest and straightforward, down from 38% last summer. But she remains highly regarded among Democrats, with 76% saying they viewed her favorably What is wrong with Democrats? Paul Begala, a Democratic pundit who has become a one-percenter by mocking Republicans in front of applauding Democratic crowds, may be right. He said “voters do not give even a fart” about Clinton’s email scandals. He is only partly right; voters do care, but seemingly not Democratic ones. Hillary Clinton had the temerity to call for “religious beliefs to be changed” to accommodate abortion. Do Democrats care? Do they care when Barack Obama denigrates Christian history, as he repeatedly does? What is wrong with Democrats? Despite the federal courts checking of Obama’s executive action regarding illegal immigrants, Hillary Clinton declared Obama did not go far enough when he gave millions of illegal immigrants de facto amnesty (reminder: Obama himself had said before he did not have the legal power to do so -- a rare instance of his knowing and respecting the law, but it was a fleeting instant). Do any Democrats have a problem with Hillary Clinton stating that Obama’s lawbreaking did not go far enough? But then again, most Democrats think illegal immigrants should have a right to vote. What is wrong with Democrats? The Democratic Party and its base are lurching to the left, led by its leadership. There may be a silver lining, however. Democrats do not believe in compromise and view Bill Clinton’s triangulation as traitorous (it was all so twentieth century, after all). They have become a party of True Believers. They may have pulled too far to the left, Peter Wehner writes. The rest of the country does not share their ideology and does not support their agenda. As Sean Trende and David Byler wrote recently, the GOP is as strong as it’s been in decades. Yes there are problems in the Republican Party but they are dwarfed by the problems many have with the Democratic Party. This was shown in the red tide that swept Democrats out of power throughout the nation last year, an event I celebrated in “Thank you, Mr. President.” So perhaps what is wrong with Democrats is what is right with the rest of Americans. They elected Obama -- twice! And will nominate Hillary Clinton. But that is just a smidgen (as Barack Obama might say) of what is wrong with Democrats. The question of what motivates Democrats and what their values are has bedeviled me for years, since I have friends and family who are Democrats. If the government was not so big and controlling it would be less of an issue, but I find decisions I would make overruled by Democrats in power. My family and I end up paying for their mistakes on top of our own. We work hard, save as much as we can, invest in the future, and find out we have the ever-grasping government as partners who can render our efforts useless. Regulations and the overseers who impose them on us add to my misery, as do tax forms that are needlessly complicated and filled with loopholes that the rich can afford to exploit. I find the fruits of our labor are harvested and enjoyed by others. I see the Constitution trampled to advance agendas I do not share. Free speech is all too often rejected as “hate speech” while watchers for “trigger words” are all too ready to censor the speech of others. I see unions corrupt politics and teachers’ unions protect their interests and the future of their pensions over protecting the future of our children we place in their care.

        "articles": "The Children’s Crusade that has invaded our southern borders has an amazing number of well-fed gangster types, grabbing their crotches and giving the finger to the news cameras. These adult-sized gangsters are not children, and they don’t act like children. They are doing sex, dope, and almost certainly work in criminal collusion with the biggest Mexican drug cartel, Sinaloa. They certainly look more like drug smugglers and mules for the youngsters who have apparently been abandoned by their real parents and by governments south of the border, to go wandering north under conditions that simply invite abuse. Would you send your own kids in wild mobs to a strange land? Do Hispanics love and protect their children less than we do? No. This is another Obama agit-prop stunt, like the Tahrir Square “spontaneous demonstration” that brought Muslim Bro Mohammed Morsi to power in Egypt. Bill Ayers was involved in those demonstrations at Egypt’s borders with Gaza, where he agitated for the barriers to come down and let Hamas into Egypt. Then the Egyptians came to their senses, and overthrew Morsi for El Sisi, a man in the mold of Anwar Sadat. Mob agitation is a standard operating tactic of these people, in close collusion with leftist media and agitator groups like the Ruckus Society, and of course our Rotten Media. So now we have a U.S. president assaulting our southern borders. Think about that. Isn’t it always the same in this administration? Three power centers had to come together to fake this refugee crisis -- with the healthiest-looking refugees in history. First is the Obama Administration, which has a long history of doing this -- based on Alinsky and ACORN training manuals. The Children’s Crusade is just another variation of Occupy Wall Street, filled with rich trust-fund kids from Upper Manhattan, who had to take the subway all the way down to Wall Street for their heroic demos against “the 1%” -- like their parents. Ayers always said that “kill your parents” is the key to The Revolution. Well, the Wall Street Occupishers trashed and excreted on the streets for the eager cameristas of the New York Times (which helped organize the demos), leaving the black and Hispanic workers of the Sanitation Department to clean up. The second big power center colluding in this assault are governments south of the border, which always play footsie with the radical left down there, like La Raza, and the cartels. Newspapers in Central America have been actively encouraging children to throw themselves on the mercy of the American people, and to overwhelm our Border Patrol. In any civilized nation that is criminal child abuse, and in this case it is large-scale, highly organized criminal child abuse, probably a defined crime against humanity. Valerie Jarrett met “several times” with La Raza and its ilk, who want to turn the United States into “Azatlan.” -- because they are entitled to own this country, of course. Our Rotten Media are playing along, as we have seen a thousand times. The third colluding organization is the Sinaloa Cartel, the biggest and most dangerous organized drug mob, which received arms from this administration in the Fast and Furious scandal. Sinaloa used those weapons to destroy their competition south of the border, and to intimidate the U.S. Border Patrol. Sinaloa had to be involved in the Children’s Crusade, because they control the southern border, probably more effectively than we do. What we are seeing therefore is an Obama-La Raza-Sinaloa alliance at work. You need to know only three facts about Sinaloa: they are huge, they are very dangerous, and they have penetrated our political-media class in cities like Chicago. This follows Alinsky doctrine that the left rises to power by building alliances with the criminal mafia against the middle class. This administration seems to love radical gangs of all kinds, from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (slogan: All we want is to die in the way of Allah!); to Hamas, which has just received de facto recognition as part of the Pals; to Hizb’allah, the Iranian proxy terror group, which runs Lebanon and does widespread drug smuggling in South America; to Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria, which is being supported by the United States and Qatar to head-chop all the infidels they want, in exchange for slicing up Assad’s control of Syria. As SecState, Hillary Clinton allowed high-level Moob infiltration by such as Huma Abedin, her “close aide,” and former Moob magazine editrix. In this administration, if the Muslim Brotherhood doesn’t know something, it’s not worth knowing. Add that to Obama’s utter surrender to the mullahs’ nuclear program, and there is no more reasonable doubt: this administration sides with our most ferocious enemies. That is the political context for the Children’s Crusade today, timed exquisitely to coincide with the amnesty bill the RINOs were going to help Obama to push through Congress. Just an amazing coincidence, you see. When the Democrats abandoned South Vietnam, desperate Vietnamese clung to the last helicopters lifting off from our embassy roof. They were truly desperate, because soon they were going to be killed or corralled in death camps, as we later saw from the Vietnamese Boat People, who sometimes made it on rafts to the safety of U.S. Navy ships, years later. Those people deserved our compassionate help to escape the death grip of Ho Chi Minh. Today’s Children’s Crusade is a very different thing. These well-fed and reportedly sexually-active kids are not refugees. They don’t look desperate. Their long bus ride across the U.S. border is not an act of desperation, and their parents, aunts, and uncles are not far behind. No; this is an organized mob, run by adults (including Valerie Jarrett and her kind), in collusion with governments and mafias south of the border -- to give our radical leftist media a chance for another tear-jerking photo op for the Hopeless Suckers of America. This is community disorganizing the Obama way. It is the scofflaw pattern we have learned to expect from this Chicago Way administration. For the internationalist media it’s Hurricane Katrina playbook, repeated to the point of boredom. Haven’t we seen these stunts before? Americans do not want to believe it, but everybody is beginning to smell massive corruption and national betrayal in this administration. We are seeing terrorist and gangland penetration. Terror gangs like Hizb’allah also deal drugs throughout Latin America. Just look at the facts. The medieval Children’s Crusade ended in death and slavery for the children who were enticed into it. In this case, La Raza, ValJar, Obama and the Sinaloa drug cartel seem to be in collusion in a crime against human rights. The DEA stated two years ago that the Sinaloa Cartel is “so deeply embedded in Chicago, we have to operate the way we do on the border.” Which throws a whole new light on this administration. For example, the “Fast and Furious” gunrunning scandal is usually thought to be an anti-gun stunt by Obama and Holder. But factor in the Sinaloa Cartel in Chicago, and Alinsky’s preaching for a radical alliance with the Chicago mafia -- then Fast and Furious begins to look like gunrunning to benefit the Sinaloa Cartel, so it could kill off the competition on the Mexican border. Sinaloa wants to break down border enforcement, and being armed to the teeth works just fine for them. A similar political-mob alliance was negotiated in Chicago a dozen years ago by Jesse Jackson. Obama rose in the Illinois Machine, mentored by the Godfather, Emil Jones. Connect the dots... When Obama made a surprise trip to Afghanistan right before the Bergdahl surrender speech at the Rose Garden, it was proclaimed to be a gesture of appreciation for the troops, despite the fact that Mohammed Karzai, the embattled but elected president of Afghanistan, didn’t want him there and remained aloof during the visit. (Imagine the media response if something like that had happened to George W. Bush.) The fact – as Karzai well knows – is that Obama is getting ready to surrender Afghanistan to the worst terrorist, woman-hating, child-abusing, America-fighting gangs, because that is his ideology. Read that again if you don’t believe it, and then simply look at the facts. Obama’s Dreams of my Father is a tribute to his Mau Mau-supporting biological father, the Third World radical. The Mau Mau operated by head-chopping isolated white farm families in Kenya, slaughtering thousands before the Brit authorities brought them under control. . That is standard operating procedure for “liberation terrorists” in Obama’s book. For Obama, the Al Qaeda affiliates who decapitated children in the Christian Syrian village of Ma’aloula were not committing the greatest evil humans are capable of. Those kids were only unlucky bystanders in the guerilla theater of jihadist Islam. The children and adults who were butchered in Nairobi’s Western Mall for the world to see were both white and black. But Al Qaeda didn’t care, because Allah will know his own when their souls fly to heaven for judgment. The 300 (by now) Nigerian girls who were stolen from their families and sold into Arab slavery -- like all the ancestors of American blacks -- are not really important in Obama’s cold mind. Nor were the young people in Tehran demonstrating against the sadistic mullahs in Iran at the start of this administration important. Who cares if mullahs quote from Allah to authorize the rape of women on death row? The ACORN manual says it plainly: In politics, might is right. That is a Hitler slogan. Most Americans are political dopes and dupes, but some of us remember who gave Osama bin Laden safe haven in Afghanistan, to plan and execute 9/11/01. The Taliban are Wahhabi fanatics, a carbon copy of Al Qaeda. The Haqqani network that captured Bowe Bergdahl is in cahoots with Iran, but Islamic fascists make tactical alliances all the time. They have a common enemy -- all the infidels of the world, especially America and Israel. As for Western Europe, it has already surrendered to a massive infiltration campaign, paid for by the oil regimes. A few weeks ago, Tony Blair wrote an article proposing that Europe must combine with Russia to fight Islamic imperialism. He is right -- Europe by itself has lost the will to live. Europe has more than 300 million educated people, but only Russia understands the danger of militant Islam, and acts without mercy. Soon enough, Europe will appeal to Russia for military protection. If our political class remains blind, deaf and dumb we may yet have to appeal to Putin and China to save us from the Obamas of this world. The Children’s Crusade that has invaded our southern borders has an amazing number of well-fed gangster types, grabbing their crotches and giving the finger to the news cameras. These adult-sized gangsters are not children, and they don’t act like children. They are doing sex, dope, and almost certainly work in criminal collusion with the biggest Mexican drug cartel, Sinaloa. They certainly look more like drug smugglers and mules for the youngsters who have apparently been abandoned by their real parents and by governments south of the border, to go wandering north under conditions that simply invite abuse. Would you send your own kids in wild mobs to a strange land? Do Hispanics love and protect their children less than we do? No. This is another Obama agit-prop stunt, like the Tahrir Square “spontaneous demonstration” that brought Muslim Bro Mohammed Morsi to power in Egypt. Bill Ayers was involved in those demonstrations at Egypt’s borders with Gaza, where he agitated for the barriers to come down and let Hamas into Egypt. Then the Egyptians came to their senses, and overthrew Morsi for El Sisi, a man in the mold of Anwar Sadat. Mob agitation is a standard operating tactic of these people, in close collusion with leftist media and agitator groups like the Ruckus Society, and of course our Rotten Media. So now we have a U.S. president assaulting our southern borders. Think about that. Isn’t it always the same in this administration? Three power centers had to come together to fake this refugee crisis -- with the healthiest-looking refugees in history. First is the Obama Administration, which has a long history of doing this -- based on Alinsky and ACORN training manuals. The Children’s Crusade is just another variation of Occupy Wall Street, filled with rich trust-fund kids from Upper Manhattan, who had to take the subway all the way down to Wall Street for their heroic demos against “the 1%” -- like their parents. Ayers always said that “kill your parents” is the key to The Revolution. Well, the Wall Street Occupishers trashed and excreted on the streets for the eager cameristas of the New York Times (which helped organize the demos), leaving the black and Hispanic workers of the Sanitation Department to clean up. The second big power center colluding in this assault are governments south of the border, which always play footsie with the radical left down there, like La Raza, and the cartels. Newspapers in Central America have been actively encouraging children to throw themselves on the mercy of the American people, and to overwhelm our Border Patrol. In any civilized nation that is criminal child abuse, and in this case it is large-scale, highly organized criminal child abuse, probably a defined crime against humanity. Valerie Jarrett met “several times” with La Raza and its ilk, who want to turn the United States into “Azatlan.” -- because they are entitled to own this country, of course. Our Rotten Media are playing along, as we have seen a thousand times. The third colluding organization is the Sinaloa Cartel, the biggest and most dangerous organized drug mob, which received arms from this administration in the Fast and Furious scandal. Sinaloa used those weapons to destroy their competition south of the border, and to intimidate the U.S. Border Patrol. Sinaloa had to be involved in the Children’s Crusade, because they control the southern border, probably more effectively than we do. What we are seeing therefore is an Obama-La Raza-Sinaloa alliance at work. You need to know only three facts about Sinaloa: they are huge, they are very dangerous, and they have penetrated our political-media class in cities like Chicago. This follows Alinsky doctrine that the left rises to power by building alliances with the criminal mafia against the middle class. This administration seems to love radical gangs of all kinds, from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (slogan: All we want is to die in the way of Allah!); to Hamas, which has just received de facto recognition as part of the Pals; to Hizb’allah, the Iranian proxy terror group, which runs Lebanon and does widespread drug smuggling in South America; to Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria, which is being supported by the United States and Qatar to head-chop all the infidels they want, in exchange for slicing up Assad’s control of Syria. As SecState, Hillary Clinton allowed high-level Moob infiltration by such as Huma Abedin, her “close aide,” and former Moob magazine editrix. In this administration, if the Muslim Brotherhood doesn’t know something, it’s not worth knowing. Add that to Obama’s utter surrender to the mullahs’ nuclear program, and there is no more reasonable doubt: this administration sides with our most ferocious enemies. That is the political context for the Children’s Crusade today, timed exquisitely to coincide with the amnesty bill the RINOs were going to help Obama to push through Congress. Just an amazing coincidence, you see. When the Democrats abandoned South Vietnam, desperate Vietnamese clung to the last helicopters lifting off from our embassy roof. They were truly desperate, because soon they were going to be killed or corralled in death camps, as we later saw from the Vietnamese Boat People, who sometimes made it on rafts to the safety of U.S. Navy ships, years later. Those people deserved our compassionate help to escape the death grip of Ho Chi Minh. Today’s Children’s Crusade is a very different thing. These well-fed and reportedly sexually-active kids are not refugees. They don’t look desperate. Their long bus ride across the U.S. border is not an act of desperation, and their parents, aunts, and uncles are not far behind. No; this is an organized mob, run by adults (including Valerie Jarrett and her kind), in collusion with governments and mafias south of the border -- to give our radical leftist media a chance for another tear-jerking photo op for the Hopeless Suckers of America. This is community disorganizing the Obama way. It is the scofflaw pattern we have learned to expect from this Chicago Way administration. For the internationalist media it’s Hurricane Katrina playbook, repeated to the point of boredom. Haven’t we seen these stunts before? Americans do not want to believe it, but everybody is beginning to smell massive corruption and national betrayal in this administration. We are seeing terrorist and gangland penetration. Terror gangs like Hizb’allah also deal drugs throughout Latin America. Just look at the facts. The medieval Children’s Crusade ended in death and slavery for the children who were enticed into it. In this case, La Raza, ValJar, Obama and the Sinaloa drug cartel seem to be in collusion in a crime against human rights. The DEA stated two years ago that the Sinaloa Cartel is “so deeply embedded in Chicago, we have to operate the way we do on the border.” Which throws a whole new light on this administration. For example, the “Fast and Furious” gunrunning scandal is usually thought to be an anti-gun stunt by Obama and Holder. But factor in the Sinaloa Cartel in Chicago, and Alinsky’s preaching for a radical alliance with the Chicago mafia -- then Fast and Furious begins to look like gunrunning to benefit the Sinaloa Cartel, so it could kill off the competition on the Mexican border. Sinaloa wants to break down border enforcement, and being armed to the teeth works just fine for them. A similar political-mob alliance was negotiated in Chicago a dozen years ago by Jesse Jackson. Obama rose in the Illinois Machine, mentored by the Godfather, Emil Jones. Connect the dots... When Obama made a surprise trip to Afghanistan right before the Bergdahl surrender speech at the Rose Garden, it was proclaimed to be a gesture of appreciation for the troops, despite the fact that Mohammed Karzai, the embattled but elected president of Afghanistan, didn’t want him there and remained aloof during the visit. (Imagine the media response if something like that had happened to George W. Bush.) The fact – as Karzai well knows – is that Obama is getting ready to surrender Afghanistan to the worst terrorist, woman-hating, child-abusing, America-fighting gangs, because that is his ideology. Read that again if you don’t believe it, and then simply look at the facts. Obama’s Dreams of my Father is a tribute to his Mau Mau-supporting biological father, the Third World radical. The Mau Mau operated by head-chopping isolated white farm families in Kenya, slaughtering thousands before the Brit authorities brought them under control. . That is standard operating procedure for “liberation terrorists” in Obama’s book. For Obama, the Al Qaeda affiliates who decapitated children in the Christian Syrian village of Ma’aloula were not committing the greatest evil humans are capable of. Those kids were only unlucky bystanders in the guerilla theater of jihadist Islam. The children and adults who were butchered in Nairobi’s Western Mall for the world to see were both white and black. But Al Qaeda didn’t care, because Allah will know his own when their souls fly to heaven for judgment. The 300 (by now) Nigerian girls who were stolen from their families and sold into Arab slavery -- like all the ancestors of American blacks -- are not really important in Obama’s cold mind. Nor were the young people in Tehran demonstrating against the sadistic mullahs in Iran at the start of this administration important. Who cares if mullahs quote from Allah to authorize the rape of women on death row? The ACORN manual says it plainly: In politics, might is right. That is a Hitler slogan. Most Americans are political dopes and dupes, but some of us remember who gave Osama bin Laden safe haven in Afghanistan, to plan and execute 9/11/01. The Taliban are Wahhabi fanatics, a carbon copy of Al Qaeda. The Haqqani network that captured Bowe Bergdahl is in cahoots with Iran, but Islamic fascists make tactical alliances all the time. They have a common enemy -- all the infidels of the world, especially America and Israel. As for Western Europe, it has already surrendered to a massive infiltration campaign, paid for by the oil regimes. A few weeks ago, Tony Blair wrote an article proposing that Europe must combine with Russia to fight Islamic imperialism. He is right -- Europe by itself has lost the will to live. Europe has more than 300 million educated people, but only Russia understands the danger of militant Islam, and acts without mercy. Soon enough, Europe will appeal to Russia for military protection. If our political class remains blind, deaf and dumb we may yet have to appeal to Putin and China to save us from the Obamas of this world.",

        "articles": "Bernie Sanders is not going to play out the script Hillary Clinton has written for him. Via Bloomberg: Bernie Sanders on Sunday marked the one-year anniversary of his bid for the White House by vowing that the Democratic convention will be \"contested,\" despite Hillary Clinton's wide lead in pledged and overall delegates. \"It's virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of convention delegates by June 14 with pledged delegates alone,\" the Vermont senator told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington. (snip) \"The evidence is extremely clear that I would be the stronger candidate to defeat Trump or any other Republican,\" Sanders said of the Republican front-runner Donald Trump. He cited several polls showing him doing better than Clinton in a hypothetical head-to-head contest against the real estate magnate. By going after Clinton’s superdelegates, Sanders can go to the heart of what Donald Trump is calling the “rigged” political process, and with far more accuracy than is possible in the GOP’s case. The superdelegates are the very essence of rigging, designed specifically to prevent the Democrats from nominating another radical like George McGovern, who brought a historic 49-state defeat to the party. Calling for reform of the Democratic Party's nominating process, Sanders said he felt \"entitled\" to support from superdelegates in states whose nominating contests he won, such as Washington state and Minnesota. The same should also be true for Clinton, he said: superdelegates should cast their votes \"in line with the people of their states.\" Many superdelegates—party leaders and elected officials not formally bound to any candidate—committed to Clinton before the 2016 campaign formally started. Sanders said they should reconsider that support in states where he defeated Clinton by a large margin, and if he did very well in the remaining contests, which include California and New Jersey on June 7. The math is tough for him, as he acknowledges. Via The Hill: Sanders said during the news conference he expects to do well in the upcoming primaries. Indiana votes Tuesday, where a new poll shows Sanders trailing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton by 4 points. He said he has won state after state after a strong majority of younger people have voted for him, noting he hopes to win Indiana in next week's primary. His campaign has sparked energy and excitement, he said, which will translate to a large voter turnout in November. Sanders then detailed the delegate math, saying that to win the majority of pledged delegates, he needs 65 percent of the remaining delegates in the upcoming contests. \"There are 10 states remaining where we are going to be vigorously competing, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam,\" he said. \"We believe that we are in a very strong position to win many of these remaining contests and we have an excellent chance to win in California, the state with far and away the most delegates.\" He admitted that the road ahead is a \"tough road to climb,\" but not an \"impossible road to climb.\" \"We intend to fight for every vote in front of us and for every delegate remaining,\" he said. \"In terms of super delegates,\" he said, \"obviously we are taking on virtually the entire Democratic establishment.\" He is going after that establishment with an appeal to their desire to win the election. Via The WaPo: “They’re going to have to go into their hearts, and they are going to have to ask, do they want the second strongest candidate to run against [GOP front-runner Donald] Trump or do they want the strongest candidate?” Sanders said, suggesting that he is the strongest based on polling data. A speech to the delegates at a contested convention could be a decisive moment, especially if backed by huge demonstrations outside the convention site in Philadelphia. Sanders has proven his ability to draw huge crowds, and the fact that the Democrats’ chosen venue is in the heart of the Acela Corridor, accessible to the largest concentration of population in the country means that if Sanders can get within striking distance, he could potentially draw tens of thousands of enthusiastic and rebellious backers, angry at the prospect of a corrupt and stale candidate being forced on them by superdelegates. But sustaining that plausibility will be a challenge. Sanders’s fundraising has already sharply declined: Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said he raised $25.8 million in April, well shy of his eye-popping totals of recent months. The figure comes as Sanders’s chance of defeating Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination have dwindled, with his loss to her in the New York primary on April 19 widely viewed as a turning point in the race. Sanders’s take, raised almost entirely online, fell about $20 million short of the $46 million he posted in March. His haul was still sizable by some measures: Clinton reported having raised about $27 million in March, not much more than Sanders’s take in April. Because of his profligate spending (after all, socialists tend to run out of other people’s money rather quickly), Sanders has very little cash on hand, unlike Clinton. With the FBI primary yet to yield results, it is difficult to predict anything, and as Joe Herring posits this morning, Hillary may already be preparing to pull the ripcord, with the connivance of President Obama. Who knows? The most unpredictable presidential election cycle of my lifetime continues to generate surprises. Bernie Sanders is not going to play out the script Hillary Clinton has written for him.

No, like The Terminator, he keeps on coming, advancing through the fusillade of snide and snarky bullets, oblivious to the ad hominem walls of fire in his path, and immune to their favorite weapon: rhetorical condescension and ridicule. Just ask George Will. “For such is the nature of man, that howsoever they may acknowledge many others to be more witty, or more eloquent, or more learned; Yet they will hardly believe there be many so wise as themselves: For they see their own wit at hand, and other men’s at a distance.” -- Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan Yet, for some inexplicable reason, the more Trump is bashed the more people love him. Why? He’s brash, not polished. He’s vulgar, not erudite. He’s a recent convert to the faith, not a lifetime conservative Republican. He’s politically incorrect, neither nuanced nor fluent in Orwellian doublethink. He’s even harsh at times to his adversaries, not disingenuously charming (like he who shall not be named). Yet all those qualities seem to make him all the more endearing to many folks. How can this be? Because the chattering class, professional politicians, lobbyists, bureaucrats, consultants, and other various species of government parasites are only looking for a standard bearer to win the balance of power and perks for their team/tribe. If their guy or gal wins, then all the power and wealth of the insatiable, ever-growing Leviathan known as Government shifts in their direction and inures to their benefit. So, naturally, their presidential aspirant must be cut from the right political cloth, hold the right pedigree and doctrinal views, possess the proper temperament, and be fully prepared to support, defend, and continue to grow the sacred institution of centralized government. The People just want a competent dragon slayer to kill the damn thing. “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.” (Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776) These days voices of extreme frustration can routinely be heard, fed up with an overreaching, out of control government. There are calls for an Article V constitutional Convention of the States (COS) with a mind to turn the Etch-a-Sketch of the USA upside down, shake it violently, and begin to redraw the limitations of government back in line with our Founders’ vision. Ever more desperate voices clamor for nothing short of armed revolution, secession, and/or another civil war. However, going back to the drawing board when we already have a wise blueprint, or slogging through bloody conflict to see who the last man standing is and then let him make the rules, might not be the only choices. Short of Revolution there is also the option of Reformation. In 1517, a lowly monk in Germany by the name of Martin Luther penned a list of ninety-five objections and grievances he held against his employer, the Holy Roman Catholic Church, and nailed it to the door of All Saints Church in Wittenberg. It’s commonly referred to as “The 95 Theses,” and is credited as being the catalyst of the Protestant Reformation. It’s no exaggeration to say this monk, and others of like mind, forever changed western civilization. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church excommunicated those it deemed heretics. It earnestly tried to quash the efforts of reformers. However, the Lutherans and the Calvinists, and what became many other Protestant denominations, rose up from this movement without a massive bloody war at the time, nor the rewriting of their foundational documents. Ergo, it can be done. Of special note, while Luther used his 95 points of argument to criticize various abuses in the Catholic Church, he was especially perturbed by the practice known as the sale of “Indulgences.” An Indulgence was basically your pay-to-play, payola scam. For example, if you had a relative who had died, the church said their soul was sent to some metaphysical place called Purgatory for some indeterminate period of time before being permitted to go on to heaven. But, for the right price paid to the church, the Pope could pull some strings with God, and voila, your loved one’s immortal soul would get to go to the head of the line, and you’d also get a nice certificate suitable for framing. Needless to say, Martin Luther found this practice to be most repugnant. Wow, imagine that – people paying those in authority to receive favors in return. It is certainly a transactional concept not limited to the confines of ecumenical environs. One might say, in the context of Washington, D.C., it’s a thriving growth industry and has been for a very long time. It’s no wonder all the counties surrounding Washington, home to so many of our public servants, are the richest in the land. This then raises the obvious question: How can an impolitic New York billionaire, who openly touts his ubiquitous past of greasing the palms of politicians of all stripes in order to amass a king’s fortune in business, possibly become a populist hero of the average citizen out there, and in particular many conservative Republicans? The answer is simple. He knows the beast. He’s familiar with its moves, its tactics, its weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and therefore he’s one of the most qualified to kill it -- or at least to bridle and saddle it, then ride it and bring it to heel. Indeed, for generations many well-intentioned patriots have attempted to assault the dragon’s lair on the Potomac. Unfortunately, their Mr. Smith-caliber zeal and integrity alone weren’t the proper weapons of St. George needed to fight the sharp teeth and talons of entrenched bureaucracy, nor the fiery breath of a complicit media and entertainment industrial complex. Who knows, perhaps Trump’s charred and gnawed bones will join the pile of carnage at the cave’s entrance like so many who have tried before him. That remains to be seen. Nevertheless, if someone were ultimately to prevail against the Leviathan of Government, whether that is Trump or anyone else, the true people’s champion would have to be someone of independent financial means. That is, he or she would need to be able to fight without ever becoming beholden to the faceless financiers and donors who only give in order to receive (and control). He must therefore be incorruptible, otherwise, we’re right back to where we are now. He or she would also need to be proven in terms of demonstrable organizational success on the world stage, not a member of the failed professional political class, or a pontificating academic, or God forbid, a malignant narcissist community organizer with zero experience in the real world. Although, being a narcissist isn’t necessarily a showstopper if this leader can truly get the job done. Saving the country won’t be judged on style points, just results. Certainly modesty isn’t one of Mr. Trump’s virtues. But as they say, it ain’t bragging if you can do it. The phenomenon of Trump’s unconventional appeal is probably best understood when he says, “I want to make America great again.” The people want to believe him, but they do so with the unspoken understanding that his comment is an unfinished sentence. There is an implied subordinate clause of, “…because it’s not great right now.” Oh, but the heart of every true American patriot sincerely wants it to be great again. So woe to the chattering class who mistakenly believes Trump’s supporters are just a fringe “protest vote.” They are indeed protesting, but they do so as the New Protestants, coming forth from both major parties along with independents, sorely aggrieved at a dysfunctional government guilty of far more than 95 transgressions. They arise together in fury because our once great government has clearly become destructive of operating by the consent of the governed, and it is therefore the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government. The people are in search of a proven leader, a fighter, and a winner who can make that abolition and alteration of government happen. Therefore, whoever that leader is, he or she could very well, not just win a national election, but with the heartfelt consent of the governed usher in an American Reformation.

Unfortunately, their Mr. Smith-caliber zeal and integrity alone weren’t the proper weapons of St. George needed to fight the sharp teeth and talons of entrenched bureaucracy, nor the fiery breath of a complicit media and entertainment industrial complex. Who knows, perhaps Trump’s charred and gnawed bones will join the pile of carnage at the cave’s entrance like so many who have tried before him. That remains to be seen. Nevertheless, if someone were ultimately to prevail against the Leviathan of Government, whether that is Trump or anyone else, the true people’s champion would have to be someone of independent financial means. That is, he or she would need to be able to fight without ever becoming beholden to the faceless financiers and donors who only give in order to receive (and control). He must therefore be incorruptible, otherwise, we’re right back to where we are now. He or she would also need to be proven in terms of demonstrable organizational success on the world stage, not a member of the failed professional political class, or a pontificating academic, or God forbid, a malignant narcissist community organizer with zero experience in the real world. Although, being a narcissist isn’t necessarily a showstopper if this leader can truly get the job done. Saving the country won’t be judged on style points, just results. Certainly modesty isn’t one of Mr. Trump’s virtues. But as they say, it ain’t bragging if you can do it. The phenomenon of Trump’s unconventional appeal is probably best understood when he says, “I want to make America great again.” The people want to believe him, but they do so with the unspoken understanding that his comment is an unfinished sentence. There is an implied subordinate clause of, “…because it’s not great right now.” Oh, but the heart of every true American patriot sincerely wants it to be great again. So woe to the chattering class who mistakenly believes Trump’s supporters are just a fringe “protest vote.” They are indeed protesting, but they do so as the New Protestants, coming forth from both major parties along with independents, sorely aggrieved at a dysfunctional government guilty of far more than 95 transgressions. They arise together in fury because our once great government has clearly become destructive of operating by the consent of the governed, and it is therefore the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government. The people are in search of a proven leader, a fighter, and a winner who can make that abolition and alteration of government happen. Therefore, whoever that leader is, he or she could very well, not just win a national election, but with the heartfelt consent of the governed usher in an American Reformation.

        "articles": "A lot of attention is paid to the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, which is the ultimate arbiter of too many things in America nowadays. But the Supreme Court can afford to hear only a small number of cases. Most cases don't make it past the various circuit courts of appeal, and so the ideological makeup of these courts is important as well. Unfortunately, over eight years, Obama packed them with leftists as much as he could. And yet, some circuit courts have better partisan balances than others. Here, then, is a list. First Circuit (Maine, N.H., R.I., Mass.): The First Circuit has four Democrats and two Republicans and no vacancies. By the way, \"four Democrats and two Republicans\" is shorthand for four judges appointed by Democrats and two judges appointed by Republicans. I presume they are one and the same, but they may not always be. This is a solid leftist circuit and will be for some time to come. Second Circuit (N.Y., Vt.): The Second Circuit has four Rs and seven Ds and two vacancies. Even if Trump fills both, Dems will still have an absolute majority. On the other hand, it's only New York and Vermont, so how much do we really care? Third Circuit (Pa., N.J., Del.): The Third Circuit has five Rs and seven Ds and two vacancies. Trump appointed one of the Rs. If the two vacancies are filled, the court could become evenly split. Fourth Circuit (Md., W.Va., Va., N.C., S.C.): The Fourth Circuit has five Rs and ten Ds and no vacancies. This will be a hard-left court for some time to come. Fifth Circuit (Texas, La., Miss.): This circuit has 10 Rs and five Ds and two vacancies. Two of the Rs were appointed by Donald Trump. Mysteriously, this circuit seems to have been protected by the rampage of leftists inflicted on the other circuit courts and is one of the most conservative in the country. Don't mess with Texas. Sixth Circuit (Mich., Ohio, Ky., Tenn.): This circuit has eleven Rs and five Ds, and three of the judges were appointed by Donald Trump. Like the Fifth Circuit, it's an oasis of conservatism. Seventh Circuit (Wis., Ill., Ind.): This circuit has six Rs and two Ds and three vacancies. One of the Rs was appointed by Donald Trump. Another surprisingly conservative court. Eighth Circuit (N.D., S.D., Neb., Minn., Iowa, Mo., Ark.): This court has nine Rs, one D, and one vacancy. Trump appointed two judges here. Yet another conservative court. Does this surprise you? It surprises me. Ninth Circuit (Calif., Wash., Ore., Idaho, Mt. Nev., Ariz., Alaska, Hawaii): The Ninth Circuit covers a huge area, and there have been many proposals to break up the circuit into two, always resisted by the minority party, who fears that the majority party would pack the new court. The Ninth Circuit has a reputation for being a hard-left court, and that reputation is well deserved, with seven Rs and 18 Ds and four vacancies. Even if Trump fills all the vacancies, this court will be to the left of the Comintern for some time to come. Tenth Circuit (Wyo., Utah, Colo., Kan., Okla., N.M.): This court has five Rs and seven Ds and no vacancies. Trump appointed one of the Rs. A close split, but no opportunity to improve at present. Eleventh Circuit (Ala., Ga., Fla.): This court has four Rs and eight Ds and no vacancies. Trump appointed one of the Rs. It's surprising that Alabama and Georgia, very conservative states, are ruled by such a leftist circuit court. D.C. Circuit (D.C.): The D.C. Circuit court covers the smallest geographical area but is really the second most powerful court after the Supreme Court because it hears cases based on regulations promulgated by federal agencies located in the District of Columbia, of which there are many. There are four Rs, seven Ds, and no vacancies. Trump appointed one judge. Unfortunately, there are no prospects for improvement any time soon. There is also a Federal Circuit Court that covers things like patents. What surprised me the most after examining this data is how few courts could shift from Trump appointments. Most circuit courts are already so far left or right, and there are so few vacancies, that Trump can really affect the balance only on the Third Circuit. Obviously, this can change over time as vacancies appear, but the partisan balance of the circuit courts aren't going to change dramatically any time soon. There are three important caveats to note. 1) Democrat = reliable liberal, but Republican doesn't always equal reliable conservative. Every Democratic judge appointed always lives up to leftist ideals, but Republican judges are not nearly as reliable on the conservative side. Over time, a certain percentage drift to the left, so if a circuit court has seven Rs and five Ds, the partisan balance may be in favor of the Republicans, but in reality, the ideological balance may be in favor of the Democrats. 2) Circuits with Democratic or Republican majorities can issue contrarian decisions. Most times, cases are not heard \"en banc\" – that is, by the entire circuit. Most cases are heard by three-judge panels chosen theoretically at random. So if a circuit has ten Ds and five Rs, it is possible for a three-judge panel to be composed of a majority of Rs. Decisions of three-judge panels can be challenged to the entire circuit, but as I said, most cases aren't heard \"en banc.\" 3) Many of you will ask, \"Why can't Congress expand the number of vacancies on the circuit court and then fill them with conservatives?\" Well, the answer is, Congress can do that. With a Republican House, Republican Senate, and Republican president, such a bill can be passed. But it won't be. The reality is that the balance of the circuit courts will not be changed for some time to come, but the good news is that a surprising number of the circuits are already conservative.

Suppose further that you knew that the future would be prosperous when you left office because the connections you made would make you a fortune as a lobbyist. Moreover, since unseating an incumbent is a herculean task, you felt that you were set for life. In fact, as soon as you got elected, you began raising money and preparing for re-election. Governing and legislating became an afterthought – something you might engage in after your next campaign was carefully planned. Suddenly, a guy runs for office with a lot of ideas about \"draining the swamp\" and making rules that include a prohibition on lobbying for at least five years after leaving office. As if that's not enough, he criticizes the \"establishment\" of which you are a significant part. To add insult to injury, this upstart comes from the private sector with no record of elective office, yet he has the audacity to run for the highest office in the land. You, and most of your colleagues, got where you are by starting in local elections, from city councils to mayor to state rep, and on to your currents spots at the national level. You didn't take him seriously throughout his long and vociferous campaign, often refusing to endorse what he said and what he stood for. When he shocked the world with a strong win against a candidate the polls said would win easily, all you could do was feign approval and acceptance. You didn't dare speak publicly about your disdain for the man who was elected to actually make America great again! Not only did this newcomer speak bluntly, eschewing politically correct tap-dancing around issues, but he spoke forcefully about the venal nature of politics and those who use it for personal aggrandizement. He didn't use lofty rhetoric and eloquent phrases like his predecessor. Instead, he spoke in a language rarely heard in a country weaned on Pied Piper-style oratory. He merely told the truth in plain words that would resonate with the proletariat, the people who made this country the envy of the world. The voters were thrilled to finally have a leader who uses common sense, rather than a wet finger in the air before making decisions. However, those who have been entrenched in their private little fiefdoms in the nation's capital began to wonder how they were going to deal with this brilliant maverick who had captured the imagination of millions of Americans who had given up on government. Democrats hate him with a ferocious intensity that comes from seeing their plans for party dominance collapse under the weight of this new spirit of patriotism. Republicans hate him for beating all their veteran politicians and for proving how ineffective they've been at improving the lives of their constituents. After all, if neither party can win with the customary bromides, spewing from the mouths of the usual suspects, they must have lost touch with the people who once lapped up their verbal vacuity, believing that it was the only pabulum on the shelf. Why would voters reject prominent names like Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, John Kasich, et al., political veterans all, in favor of a neophyte? Those questions continue to haunt the inhabitants of that sewer on the Potomac. They don't appreciate being forced out of the darkness, where greedy deals are made and concern for the people gets thrown under the grinding wheels of political expediency. These are not exactly profiles in courage. With rare exceptions, these are people who arrived at the \"shining city upon a hill\" with the intention of making a career, and if that meant going along to get along, it was fine with them. They weren't about to step out of their comfort zones by addressing controversial topics that might make them unpopular during the next plebiscite. Hence, when an intrepid leader emerges and abandons caution in favor of keeping his campaign promises, he's treated like an anomaly. The fact that he's fighting for the principles voters elected him to fight for is lost on those who got elected with one thought in mind: to feather their own nests.

        "articles": "Liberalism often exhibits the classic symptoms of Munchausen Syndrome, a mental disorder whereby caretakers further enfeeble the chronically enfeebled as a means to power and privilege. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) describes Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another (FDIA) as a psychiatric disorder most common among mothers who intentionally harm or describe nonexistent symptoms in their children to get the attention given to the family of someone who is sick. The disorder was formerly known as Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSbP/MSP). FDIA is considered a form of abuse by the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children. However, cases have been reported of adult victims, especially the disabled or elderly. The Cleveland Clinic’s web page lists the common symptoms of FDIA: the person is often a parent, but may be an adult child, spouse, or caretaker of a disabled adult; appears quite concerned (some would say overly concerned) about the designated patient; is very friendly and cooperative with health care providers. This description fits the Democrat Party like a bespoke suit. For example, the cozy relationship between Democrats and big health care providers demonstrates the classic I’ll scratch your back, you scratch mine bond. One goal of ObamaCare was to compel the private companies of the U.S. health industry to become adjuncts of the federal government. Health care providers endorsed the law and traded $155 billion in cuts to hospital reimbursement for the payola of more government-insured (and taxpayer subsidized) patients. Meanwhile, to hell with health care consumers saddled with higher deductibles, higher co-pays, higher premiums, and fewer heath care choices. So too, Democrats never tire of hectoring Blacks, women, gays and other carefully delineated minorities that they are victims of malevolent economic and social forces that only Democrats can thwart. The strategy is to parley the good will their utopian schemes generate among these victim classes, media, academia, organized labor, government bureaucrats, and the casual voter swayed by platitudes and sound bites into wins on election day. Without this coalition of the dependent the Democrat Party would cease to exist. Time and again, Democrat policies launched with great fanfare (Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society”) to assist the disadvantaged have resulted in their disadvantage. For example, while President Obama’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from the present $7.25/hr. to $10.10/hr. makes a great sound bite, it’s certain to harm its putative beneficiaries. In June, the Los Angeles City Council approved a rise in the minimum wage from the current $9 an hour to $15 an hour by 2020. Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat who pushed for the increase, predicted net job growth and, most importantly, “poverty alleviation.” The increase was opposed by small businesses and the region’s Chamber of Commerce, which said it will hurt stores and restaurants and cost the city jobs. Well, early reports from the real world don’t bode well for unskilled workers. The Wall Street Journal reports that on the August call with securities analysts Wendy Company CFO Todd Penegor talked about the pressure to pay higher wages and said that “we continue to look at initiatives and how we work to offset any impacts of future wage inflation through technology initiatives, whether that’s self-order kiosks (and) automating more in the back of the house in the restaurant. And you’ll see a lot more coming on that front later this year from us.” Entrepreneurs aren’t in business to lose money. The Boston Consulting Group predicts that investment in industrial robots will grow 10 percent a year in the world’s 25-biggest export nations through 2025, up from 2 percent to 3 percent per year now. The investment will pay off in lower costs and increased efficiency. Robots will cut labor costs by 22 percent in the United States. Only 10 percent of jobs that can be automated have already been taken by robots. Boston Consulting predicts that by 2025 machines will have more than 23 percent. One needn’t be a Harvard grad to foresee that the days of young (often Black or Hispanic) unskilled workers are numbered. Wendy's CEO Emil Brolick laments \" that.... some of these increases will clearly end up hurting the people they are intended to help. And we continue to believe that one of the great opportunities you have in a business like ours is that an entry-level person… can rise to become a manager in a restaurant, and have an income above the median household income in the United States of America.” The political strain of FDIA infects the economy from energy (the negative effects of President Obama’s energy policies on jobs and energy prices), to state licensing boards (license to braid hair?), to local red tape throttling small business startups. Just another road to liberal hell paved with liberal good intentions The baffling question is why victims of the disorder have not summoned the courage to cry, “Please stop helping us!” Liberalism often exhibits the classic symptoms of Munchausen Syndrome, a mental disorder whereby caretakers further enfeeble the chronically enfeebled as a means to power and privilege. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) describes Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another (FDIA) as a psychiatric disorder most common among mothers who intentionally harm or describe nonexistent symptoms in their children to get the attention given to the family of someone who is sick. The disorder was formerly known as Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSbP/MSP). FDIA is considered a form of abuse by the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children. However, cases have been reported of adult victims, especially the disabled or elderly. The Cleveland Clinic’s web page lists the common symptoms of FDIA: the person is often a parent, but may be an adult child, spouse, or caretaker of a disabled adult; appears quite concerned (some would say overly concerned) about the designated patient; is very friendly and cooperative with health care providers. This description fits the Democrat Party like a bespoke suit. For example, the cozy relationship between Democrats and big health care providers demonstrates the classic I’ll scratch your back, you scratch mine bond. One goal of ObamaCare was to compel the private companies of the U.S. health industry to become adjuncts of the federal government. Health care providers endorsed the law and traded $155 billion in cuts to hospital reimbursement for the payola of more government-insured (and taxpayer subsidized) patients. Meanwhile, to hell with health care consumers saddled with higher deductibles, higher co-pays, higher premiums, and fewer heath care choices. So too, Democrats never tire of hectoring Blacks, women, gays and other carefully delineated minorities that they are victims of malevolent economic and social forces that only Democrats can thwart. The strategy is to parley the good will their utopian schemes generate among these victim classes, media, academia, organized labor, government bureaucrats, and the casual voter swayed by platitudes and sound bites into wins on election day. Without this coalition of the dependent the Democrat Party would cease to exist. Time and again, Democrat policies launched with great fanfare (Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society”) to assist the disadvantaged have resulted in their disadvantage. For example, while President Obama’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from the present $7.25/hr. to $10.10/hr. makes a great sound bite, it’s certain to harm its putative beneficiaries. In June, the Los Angeles City Council approved a rise in the minimum wage from the current $9 an hour to $15 an hour by 2020. Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat who pushed for the increase, predicted net job growth and, most importantly, “poverty alleviation.” The increase was opposed by small businesses and the region’s Chamber of Commerce, which said it will hurt stores and restaurants and cost the city jobs. Well, early reports from the real world don’t bode well for unskilled workers. The Wall Street Journal reports that on the August call with securities analysts Wendy Company CFO Todd Penegor talked about the pressure to pay higher wages and said that “we continue to look at initiatives and how we work to offset any impacts of future wage inflation through technology initiatives, whether that’s self-order kiosks (and) automating more in the back of the house in the restaurant. And you’ll see a lot more coming on that front later this year from us.” Entrepreneurs aren’t in business to lose money. The Boston Consulting Group predicts that investment in industrial robots will grow 10 percent a year in the world’s 25-biggest export nations through 2025, up from 2 percent to 3 percent per year now. The investment will pay off in lower costs and increased efficiency. Robots will cut labor costs by 22 percent in the United States. Only 10 percent of jobs that can be automated have already been taken by robots. Boston Consulting predicts that by 2025 machines will have more than 23 percent. One needn’t be a Harvard grad to foresee that the days of young (often Black or Hispanic) unskilled workers are numbered. Wendy's CEO Emil Brolick laments \" that.... some of these increases will clearly end up hurting the people they are intended to help. And we continue to believe that one of the great opportunities you have in a business like ours is that an entry-level person… can rise to become a manager in a restaurant, and have an income above the median household income in the United States of America.” The political strain of FDIA infects the economy from energy (the negative effects of President Obama’s energy policies on jobs and energy prices), to state licensing boards (license to braid hair?), to local red tape throttling small business startups.

The third generation Kim dynasty heir, Kim Jong-un, has been missing from public sight for a month, and may be ill, dead, or overthrown. There is much speculation, and contradictory reports are circulating, including the assertion that Pyongyang is sealed off, and no one is being permitted to enter or leave. But one fact is clear and it is dramatic. CNN reports: With Kim Jong Un out of sight for a month, a covey of North Korea's high officials popped down to South Korea for a last minute jaunt on Saturday, and delivered a diplomatic bonbon. The three officials told South Korea that Pyongyang is willing to hold a second round of high-level meetings between late October and early November, South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement Saturday. Hwang Pyong-so (left), director of North Korean military`s General Political Bureau, shake hands with South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae at Incheon Oakwood Hotel on Saturday. (Yonhap) High level visits from North Korea to Seoul don’t just happen casually, because some people wanted to attend the closing ceremonies of the Asian Games, the official pretext being offered. I strongly suspect that some kind of deal with the South is being sought by the North, probably out of desperation over their situation, which is very bad, and possibly triggered by Kim Jong un’s illness, death, incapacity, or overthrow. Politics in North Korea revolve around factions built on personal loyalty. If there is currently a group that wants some form of rapprochement with the South in power, it is always possible that they will be overthrown by a hardline group. However, the willingness of people to leave Pyongyang and visit Seoul suggests that they are reasonably confident of their hold on power. The fundamental dynamics of North Korea’s confrontation with the South have changed dramatically over the past decade, leading me to be more hopeful than ever before of the possibility of reform there. North Korea is no longer hermetically sealed off from information about the outside world. Until the advent of cheap video players and memory sticks, as well as cheap cell phones, in many cases dropped or smuggled into North Korea, most people knew very little about the vast gulf that separated their lives from those of their cousins south of the border. But now, thanks to these technologies cheaply produced in mass quantities by South Korea and widely available in the North, despite the regime’s best efforts, North Korean realize that they do not have to live at the margin of starvation, that people just like them, quite nearby, have cars, air-conditioning, flat screen TVs, and all the appurtenances of a prosperous modern life. Those propaganda videos on the glories of the Kim family and the need to fight back against the imperialist exploiters of the South Korean masses fall a little flat these days. South Korea is now a rich, developed nation, a peer of Europe, Japan and America, and that is a huge source of pride for Koreans, whose national inferiority complex is severe, after decades of subjugation to the Japanese that still rankles. If Kim Jong-un is dead, seriously ill, or overthrown, finding a legitimate successor may be quite difficult. Given the factionalism there, competing successors may exist, and war between factions associated with them could be anticipated. It may seem that the wealth South Korea potentially could provide would heal a lot of wounds, particularly if the leadership negotiates an amnesty for themselves, and perhaps enough money to live comfortably in the south of France for the rest of their days. I have to wonder how much information our South Korean allies are sharing with American diplomats. If I were they, I would be very cautious about involving the Obama administration, whose diplomatic competence is open to serious question. It is always possible that nothing will come of this shocking diplomatic foray, or that the forces of the hardliners in Pyongyang will triumph. Or even that a desperate war will be started by a regime that fears its own death. But for now, I have my fingers crossed that we may finally see the end of an evil, repressive, communist regime.

        "articles": "The virus that causes people to go mad and vote Democrat has apparently spread to erstwhile conservatives. Take Ann Coulter, please. She writes: For reasons of purity, we dumped an unbeatable Republican candidate and ran a conservative activist with no electoral victories to her in name for the U.S Senate from Delaware -- a state that hasn't voted for a Republican president in nearly two decades. For no good reason, we threw out another sure-winner incumbent Republican senator from Indiana. Driven by a \"Privatize the Lighthouses\" purity, we ended up with a narcissistic loon running for the U.S. Senate from Missouri. Ann's not the only one, of course. Plenty of people who I used to think were on our side are blaming the \"Tea Party,\" whatever that is. The usual suspects are Christine O'Donnell (the Delaware case that Coulter refers to), Sharron Angle (Nevada), Richard Mourdock (Indiana), and Todd Akin (Missouri). (Akin's problem had nothing to do with privatizing lighthouses, but everything to do with his theory of the reproductive process.) Maybe you've heard the phrase, \"use your words.\" I tell people to \"use your memory.\" Let me refresh your memory with this chart. (It took 50 Republicans to ensure majority control of the Senate while Bush was president. After that, it would take 51.) Source for numbers: US Senate. On January 2, 2007, the U.S. Senate had 55 Republican senators. Just over two years later, it had only 41. Republicans lost majority control of the Senate in 2006, and then lost so many more senators in 2008 that the Democrats could finagle their way to filibuster-proof control. For our sins we were saddled with the $830-billion Stimulus in 2009 and ObamaCare in 2010, causing a permanent increase in federal spending and regulation from then to infinity. Those sins, by the way, were then baked into the cake. All Democrats needed to do after that was insist on continuing resolutions. Look at those years again. The loss of the both houses of Congress, Obama's election, the Obama Stimulus, and ObamaCare all happened before the 2010 elections, meaning before the first nationwide election in which the Tea Party existed. And what happened immediately after the Tea Party came into existence? (1) A record-setting gain of seats in state legislatures, gaining control of 14 more chambers in the states and achieving control of both chambers in 26 states. (2) A gain of 64 seats in the House of Representatives, enough to win back majority control after four years of Democrat control. (3) A gain of 6 seats in the Senate, wiping out 75% of the devastating losses from the 2008 election. Republicans won just about everything that could be won in 2010, except the Senate. One reason for that? Only one third of the Senate is up for election in any election year. Thirty-five Senate seats were up for election in 2010, and only 19 of them were held by Democrats. Do the math: to gain control of the Senate, Republicans would have had to hold all 16 of their seats and then win 10 of the 19 seats held by Democrats. The actual result: they held all 16 of their seats and won 6 seats from Democrats. Go ahead, blame the Tea Party. But for Princess Ann, the pea under all those winning mattresses was Christine O'Donnell. Use your math, Ann. Let's hypothesize that both Tea Party ogres, O'Donnell and Angel, had won in 2010. That would have given Republicans 49 Senate seats, still two short of majority control. Those were not critical losses, even if you assume (and one can only assume) that the non-Tea Party Republicans would have won those seats. And while we're assuming, let's assume that Richard Mourdock's and Todd Akin's primary opponents had won in 2012. Then, instead of 45 Republican senators, we'd have 47, still well short of majority control. Scott Brown lost in that same election, despite being the incumbent. Too Tea Party pure? Just prior to the Tea Party's existence, Republicans had 178 seats in the House and 41 in the Senate. Today, two elections post-Tea Party, they have 234 seats in the House and 45 in the Senate. Go ahead, blame the Tea Party. People whining about the Tea Party are the real \"purists.\" They expect miracles from the Tea Party while accepting all the excuses in the world from non-Tea Partiers. Let's review how this all started, shall we? It was in the elections of 2006 that Republicans lost control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. And it was in 2008 that Democrats won the presidency and gained even larger majorities in both houses of Congress. Now, what had happened prior to that? The Tea Party didn't even exist, remember? What happened was that Republicans had everything at the national level -- House, Senate, and president -- for the first time since 1954. And they were not very Tea Party. That is why we are in the mess we're in. The Tea Party is not demanding purity; it is demanding sanity. We Tea Party types kept our mouths shut for 20 years and voted Republican as the Party nominated George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, George W. Bush, and John McCain. We bit our tongues as our president waxed wise about \"compassionate conservatism\" and Karl Rove talked of a new Republican era. But they won two elections in 2000 and 2004, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt that they at least knew how to \"win.\" We were hoping to get two steps forward for every step backward. But what were our forward steps? What did we \"win\"? Republicans spent more. They regulated more. They expanded programs we Tea Partiers had hoped to eliminate. And they invented a whole new $8-trillion entitlement that none of us asked for. We weren't looking for purity at all, but simply one iota of a difference from Democrats. \"But you can't expect to elect a Jim DeMint in Vermont.\" No, but we did elect Jim Jeffords. How did that work for us? Arlen Specter? Charlie Crist? How many times do you expect us to kick Lucy's football? So stop looking at the mote in the Tea Party's eye, and start looking at the beam in your own.

        "articles": "I think that the Sermon on the Mount applies to the vast majority of Republican Party officialdom right now. “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.” The Republican Party once was the party of conservatives. It still is the only place any conservative can be elected in today’s political world. So far. Unfortunately, the party of Reagan has disappeared. Trump did not make them disappear, but his improbable run, and win, has revealed who the party really is. And it ain’t pretty. It’s been apparent for a while that they are the stupid party. But I never thought they were this stupid. It’s been apparent for a long time they had Stockholm Syndrome. Captured by the left, they have been cowed into being spineless mushes afraid to be called names. But I never thought it was this bad. It’s been apparent for a while this is a party interested in taking a back seat, as long as they get money, perks, and some kind of fame. But I never thought it was this corrupt. Something has gone very wrong since Trump ascended. And it’s not him. He’s virtually the only one trying to do the right things. At this point, it’s clear we have a combination of sick factions in the GOP, and none of them give a damn about the party’s voters, none of them give a damn about the principles they claim to have stood for in the past years, and none of them have a clue about what they are doing. What has this party done since Trump saved their bacon, keeping them in the majority, saving them from becoming a worthless second fiddle to a corrupt Hillary? Nothing. Just nothing. And now worse than nothing. I am not the first to say this, but let’s be clear, the GOP has become a party of spineless wimps and frauds. They have betrayed half of America, betrayed the base that once supported them so well, and also betrayed their country. They have been watching fecklessly as the left is destroying the agenda they were sent to put into place. They have been sitting on their hands while the left has been destroying their own party’s president, not only doing nothing, but often actively helping the left in their attempts to take him down. They allowed this nonsense of Russia!Russia!Russia! to fester, knowing it was nonsense (and yes, it’s provable that they all knew). None of them stepped up to the plate to tell the left, the media, the public and the world that it was an asinine construct that had no evidence and simply wasn’t true. Instead of actively coming against this pack of lies, they sat on their hands and let the dumbest narrative ever pressed into American politics fester into something almost half of the country psychotically believes. They also sat on their hands as the left attacked Trump, his cabinet, and his family about anything and everything. They watched like sheep as the agenda we voted has been neutered, all the while they, the GOP, were doing nothing, nothing at all. It’s been a deadly mix of laziness, Stockholm Syndrome, and spineless, unprincipled crap. Add to that a few more ingredients: money grubbing from donors (who did not want what their voters wanted), along with the simple faithless actions of a lot of them. They were hoping against hope that their friends the #NeverTrumps would finally prevail and be able to say they told us so. Add the renewed iciness of their own base toward their party, and……… You have mixed a toxic drink that could virtually leave the GOP in shambles. No, most of them don’t know it, they are simply too stupid, spineless, dishonest and money grubbing to understand just how awful they look to their own voters. They lost the election of 2006 and 2008 for similar reasons, the base simply checked out and stayed home. Even back then, the bad GOP wasn’t this bad. At this point, there are only a few ways this can go. The voters that got excited about Trump and his America First agenda might stay home. They might try to get rid of party leaders (liars all), taking many of them out through primaries and other party arrangements. One more possibility: you could have a wave of resolved anger sweep through the center right voting base. If it comes to that, the cold civil war could become pretty dang hot. Whichever way it goes, the GOP will never be the same. You think I’m advocating violence? Not at all. Sorry Charlie, that’s what the Neville Chamberlain Republicans did by signing a peace treaty with the left. Peace in their time. Oops, that didn’t end peacefully the first time? Good grief, the GOP has sat on its hands as the Republic we once knew has descended into mob rule; the things we believed in have been mocked, derided, and called every name in the book. They virtually looked the other way as one of their own congressmen got shot. They have given us the equivalent of Jeb Bush for legislators. The majorities that we voted in are a bunch of mealy mouthed, clueless fools who spent all their money as did Jeb to get three delegates. GOP: You promised us an immediate repeal and replacement of Obamacare, and after nine months of absurdities, you not only failed, but you did nothing to discipline those who made it fail. Paul Ryan is still speaker, McConnell majority leader, the senators who prevented this promise from being enacted were turncoats and received no consequences from their leadership. Other than ratify some good judges, nothing else has been done by Congress. The GOP watched the left, through their toady media shills, and their fractured foolishness, take down everything we voted for. Now the GOP is clucking about a ginned-up narrative concerning Charlottesville. They’re now blaming Trump for telling the truth: that the violence of the Antifa, and the leftist groups is just as bad as the Nazi skin heads, and just as unforgiveable. They’re kowtowing like cowards to things that never happened and to made up narratives. They’re running away because they can’t stand to be called racist. They’re watching as history is being rewritten, and they’re allowing their base to be tarred as racists, bigots, and Nazis. Trust me, that will not go well. It’s never been this bad, because the GOP has never been this bad. And we now know because Trump inadvertently shined the light of truth on who they really are. The election of Trump revealed the party of frauds. It was never his intention, but that’s what has happened. They have been undressed before the whole world. They have no clothes. What is a nation who has been lied to by both parties supposed to do? What is the base of the GOP going to do? I don’t know, but I do know I’ve never seen the center right base so disgusted and angry at its own. GOP: Trust me, the base hasn’t left Trump, but it has left you. It’s not official yet, but the avalanche is about to begin. The anger is going to boil over. Upon you. GOP: you’re not going to like it, but you have no one to blame but yourselves. To the very small list of conservatives that fought the good fight: I apologize. But to the rest: You have become like the salt in the parable. Good for nothing. I think that the Sermon on the Mount applies to the vast majority of Republican Party officialdom right now. “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.” The Republican Party once was the party of conservatives. It still is the only place any conservative can be elected in today’s political world. So far. Unfortunately, the party of Reagan has disappeared. Trump did not make them disappear, but his improbable run, and win, has revealed who the party really is. And it ain’t pretty. It’s been apparent for a while that they are the stupid party. But I never thought they were this stupid. It’s been apparent for a long time they had Stockholm Syndrome. Captured by the left, they have been cowed into being spineless mushes afraid to be called names. But I never thought it was this bad. It’s been apparent for a while this is a party interested in taking a back seat, as long as they get money, perks, and some kind of fame. But I never thought it was this corrupt. Something has gone very wrong since Trump ascended. And it’s not him. He’s virtually the only one trying to do the right things. At this point, it’s clear we have a combination of sick factions in the GOP, and none of them give a damn about the party’s voters, none of them give a damn about the principles they claim to have stood for in the past years, and none of them have a clue about what they are doing. What has this party done since Trump saved their bacon, keeping them in the majority, saving them from becoming a worthless second fiddle to a corrupt Hillary? Nothing. Just nothing. And now worse than nothing. I am not the first to say this, but let’s be clear, the GOP has become a party of spineless wimps and frauds. They have betrayed half of America, betrayed the base that once supported them so well, and also betrayed their country. They have been watching fecklessly as the left is destroying the agenda they were sent to put into place. They have been sitting on their hands while the left has been destroying their own party’s president, not only doing nothing, but often actively helping the left in their attempts to take him down. They allowed this nonsense of Russia!Russia!Russia! to fester, knowing it was nonsense (and yes, it’s provable that they all knew). None of them stepped up to the plate to tell the left, the media, the public and the world that it was an asinine construct that had no evidence and simply wasn’t true. Instead of actively coming against this pack of lies, they sat on their hands and let the dumbest narrative ever pressed into American politics fester into something almost half of the country psychotically believes. They also sat on their hands as the left attacked Trump, his cabinet, and his family about anything and everything. They watched like sheep as the agenda we voted has been neutered, all the while they, the GOP, were doing nothing, nothing at all. It’s been a deadly mix of laziness, Stockholm Syndrome, and spineless, unprincipled crap. Add to that a few more ingredients: money grubbing from donors (who did not want what their voters wanted), along with the simple faithless actions of a lot of them. They were hoping against hope that their friends the #NeverTrumps would finally prevail and be able to say they told us so. Add the renewed iciness of their own base toward their party, and……… You have mixed a toxic drink that could virtually leave the GOP in shambles. No, most of them don’t know it, they are simply too stupid, spineless, dishonest and money grubbing to understand just how awful they look to their own voters. They lost the election of 2006 and 2008 for similar reasons, the base simply checked out and stayed home. Even back then, the bad GOP wasn’t this bad. At this point, there are only a few ways this can go. The voters that got excited about Trump and his America First agenda might stay home. They might try to get rid of party leaders (liars all), taking many of them out through primaries and other party arrangements. One more possibility: you could have a wave of resolved anger sweep through the center right voting base. If it comes to that, the cold civil war could become pretty dang hot. Whichever way it goes, the GOP will never be the same. You think I’m advocating violence? Not at all. Sorry Charlie, that’s what the Neville Chamberlain Republicans did by signing a peace treaty with the left. Peace in their time. Oops, that didn’t end peacefully the first time? Good grief, the GOP has sat on its hands as the Republic we once knew has descended into mob rule; the things we believed in have been mocked, derided, and called every name in the book. They virtually looked the other way as one of their own congressmen got shot. They have given us the equivalent of Jeb Bush for legislators. The majorities that we voted in are a bunch of mealy mouthed, clueless fools who spent all their money as did Jeb to get three delegates. GOP: You promised us an immediate repeal and replacement of Obamacare, and after nine months of absurdities, you not only failed, but you did nothing to discipline those who made it fail. Paul Ryan is still speaker, McConnell majority leader, the senators who prevented this promise from being enacted were turncoats and received no consequences from their leadership. Other than ratify some good judges, nothing else has been done by Congress. The GOP watched the left, through their toady media shills, and their fractured foolishness, take down everything we voted for. Now the GOP is clucking about a ginned-up narrative concerning Charlottesville. They’re now blaming Trump for telling the truth: that the violence of the Antifa, and the leftist groups is just as bad as the Nazi skin heads, and just as unforgiveable. They’re kowtowing like cowards to things that never happened and to made up narratives. They’re running away because they can’t stand to be called racist. They’re watching as history is being rewritten, and they’re allowing their base to be tarred as racists, bigots, and Nazis. Trust me, that will not go well. It’s never been this bad, because the GOP has never been this bad. And we now know because Trump inadvertently shined the light of truth on who they really are.

        "articles": "Recently, a group of 1,400 law professors signed onto a public statement addressed to the Senate Judiciary Committee condemning the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to the position of attorney general. The statement was published in anticipation of Sessions's impending confirmation and included a string of allegations. To wit: Some of us have concerns about his misguided prosecution of three civil rights activists for voter fraud in Alabama in 1985, and his consistent promotion of the myth of voter-impersonation fraud. Some of us have concerns about his support for building a wall along our country's southern border. Some of us have concerns about his robust support for regressive drug policies that have fueled mass incarceration. Some of us have concerns about his questioning of the relationship between fossil fuels and climate change. Some of us have concerns about his repeated opposition to legislative efforts to promote the rights of women and members of the LGBTQ community. Some of us share all of these concerns. I am not a \"Trumpkin.\" I did not support President-Elect Donald Trump's campaign, did not vote for him (nor Clinton), and have in fact publicly criticized him. Likewise, I have no personal interests or loyalties aligning with Senator Jeff Sessions's nomination. Specifically, the statement's imprecision – at once obvious in its generous use of the phrase \"some of us\" – is suspect; surely the accomplished scholar who authored the statement would not engage in such character assassination without a more concrete base of support. The statement's vagueness permeates further, ultimately devolving into broad accusations more akin to Democratic talking points than serious claims by a body of legal scholars. Indeed, the statement's only specification concerns a \"misguided prosecution of three civil rights activists for voter fraud in Alabama in 1985.\" That case, which Sessions oversaw as a federal prosecutor, involved a group of black voters and election officials accusing three defendants (also black) of unlawfully altering absentee ballots. The accusation arose in Perry County, Alabama, an area that only two years earlier had struggled with voter fraud targeted at the \"aged, infirm, or disabled\" (the problem was so severe that the predominantly black constituency called for federal intervention and \"vigorous prosecutions of all violations of the voting laws\"). A subsequent examination determined that the ballots had in fact been altered, and the defendants, who were later acquitted, admitted they had performed the alterations (they believed they had acted lawfully). Even the son of one of the defendants in the case – a black Democrat who has endorsed Sessions for attorney general – said Sessions is \"not a racist\" and that Sessions \"wasn't on a witch hunt to seek out my father and my mother.\" Why all the vagueness in the law professors' statement? It could be that the professors are out of their depth and cannot help but understand all sporadic hearsay involving \"insensitivity\" and disagreement with civil rights activists as per se racism. Or perhaps the professors are unsure of the soundness of their accusations; what little substance I found supporting the professors' (apologies – \"some\" professors') position is at best circumstantial. My guess is that the professors must remain equivocal because the statement is nothing more than an expression of the professors' political and personal preferences, not the product of a well reasoned legal analysis. The devil is always in the details; if the professors were more explicit in their allegations, their seemingly obvious moral assertions would become less universal, exposing the statement's underlying bias. The statement could no longer masquerade as an opinion on a question of law to which society owes professors of law a special deference; instead, it would be a personal belief, to which society owes nothing. Students of these professors should be extremely wary. It takes a seasoned coward to hide a fallible personal conviction behind an intimidating title like \"Professor of Law,\" and if these professors are comfortable doing so in a public forum, there is little doubt they are comfortable doing so in the relative privacy of the classroom. Being a law student is a vulnerable position. Because students cannot possibly replicate a professor's decades of research in just a few months, they are frequently forced to trust their professors at their word – at least until students develop the legal acumen to meaningfully challenge their professors. In exchange, professors must be entirely forthcoming about the law, even if doing so reveals ideas contrary to their personal beliefs. No doubt bearing such an extraordinary level of trust is a tremendous honor. Unfortunately, honor seems to be out of style for the 1,400 professors who signed on to this statement. Hopefully, their students are not taking notes. Thomas Wheatley is a law student at the Antonin Scalia Law School in Arlington, Va.

        "articles": "Millennials, those born between 1982 and 2004, are the largest age cohort in American history, and according to a recent poll, most of them (44%) prefer socialism to capitalism (42%). An earlier 2015 poll found an even larger number of Millennials (53%) with a \"favorable opinion\" of socialism. Inference: America is in trouble. Maybe Donald Trump can stem the tide for another four or even eight years, but support for socialism will continue to mount as long as Millennials remain ignorant of what socialism really is. The greatest danger to this country comes from the fact that so many Millennials don't understand politics and economics. How else to explain Millennial support for Bernie Sanders, an avowed socialist? With a 75% approval rating overall, and higher among Millennials, Sanders is \"the most popular politician in the country,\" according to the Observer. According to his official website, Sanders supports a long list of liberal causes: free health care and college tuition for all, \"combating climate change to save the planet,\" \"fighting for women's rights,\" \"fighting for LGBT equality,\" \"fighting for nurses,\" \"empowering tribal nations,\" \"fighting for the rights of native Hawaiians,\" \"standing with Guam\" (huh?) – all of it paid for by \"making the wealthy pay their fair share.\" It seems that Bernie is \"fighting\" for just about everybody except straight white males and that nebulous crowd he calls \"the rich.\" Sanders intends to use the tax code to force the rich to pay more. Oddly enough, Sanders himself is one of these nefarious rich people. His net income in 2016 was over one million dollars. Nothing in the tax code prevents any taxpayer from contributing more than their required amount of tax to the federal government. So far as I know, Bernie has not done so. So it would seem that he doesn't mean it when he talks about the rich paying more, or he would have done so. Maybe Bernie is just a clever capitalist, who, along with Nancy Pelosi with her $140 million and financier husband, masquerades as a socialist. At its heart, capitalism is a liberating philosophy of life whereby individuals participate freely in markets by trading their goods or services for those of others. Under capitalism, individuals are incentivized to work by the rewards of the free market. Socialism substitutes state control and state ownership. It dictates wages and prices, creating a hugely inefficient and corrupt system that always ends in bankruptcy. Bernie's vision of the future is so hackneyed a version of all this that it would be funny if it weren't so dangerous. According to one respected website, Bernie's health care plan (\"Medicare for All\") alone would bankrupt America. Estimates of Medicare for All costs to taxpayers range from $3.1 to $14 trillion over the first decade. Bernie proposes to fund his proposal by raising taxes on the rich, but that revenue, even if it could be collected, would not be enough. With F.Y. 2018 federal spending at $4 trillion, the addition of another $855 billion in annual spending (based on an average of the estimates for Bernie's plan) involves a 21.4% tax increase (not counting funding for all of Bernie's other initiatives). Since they already pay 90% of taxes, and since Bernie rules out middle-class tax increases, this increase would fall exclusively on the top 10% of earners. So for those affluent taxpayers, Bernie's plan for health care alone would entail a tax increase of 23.75%. Meanwhile, Bernie's \"free\" college tuition plan would cost an estimated $70 billion annually. That's another 1.94% increase in federal tax for \"the rich.\" Climate change initiatives, increased regulation, and race- and gender-based giveaways would place more burdens on affluent taxpayers. Altogether, Sanders-style socialism would drive marginal federal and state rates to at least 70% in high-tax states, not counting sales tax, property tax, and countless other taxes and fees. Meanwhile, socialism promises what amounts to income for life for those who choose not to work. This being the case, who in his right mind would strive to become a successful entrepreneur – or surgeon, accountant, or business leader – when he could hang out in Boulder and smoke dope for the next forty years? There are many words to describe socialism. Having lived under communism myself, I am thoroughly familiar with the idleness, poverty, and demoralization collectivism breeds. It was commonplace to visit a restaurant in Belgrade, be handed an elaborate menu listing hundreds of choices, and then be told, \"Soup, salad, and bread – nothing else today.\" Loss of power and water in communist Yugoslavia and Bulgaria was an everyday occurrence. And secret police and neighborhood spies were everywhere. Among the old, there was bitterness, and among the young, only the ambition to get out. That to me is the essence of socialism: idleness, poverty, and repression. But how many Millennials know this? How many care to know? Not many, and not many of their teachers are making an effort to teach them about socialism. Within university departments of history, among faculty who should know better, liberals outnumber conservatives by a ratio of more than 33 to 1. With the sort of education they receive, it's not surprising that Millennials are attracted by the increasing radicalism of the Democratic Party – and given the radicalism of its base, it's not surprising that the Democratic Party is rapidly becoming openly socialist. According to Pew Research, Millennials tilt Democratic by a 51-to-35% margin. Interestingly, their grandparents (the \"Silent Generation,\" aged 69-86) have now abandoned the Democratic Party in large numbers. These voters contributed to Trump's victory in 2016. What does the Silent Generation know that Millennials don't? To begin with, they know that the world is a dangerous place. They grew up in the shadow of WWII and lived through the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War. They lived with the fear of all-out nuclear war, with reports of Soviet spying and the horrors of Chinese and North Korean communism. They learned of gulags, executions, and starvation – and they knew how fortunate they were to have been born in America. They also know how difficult it is to maintain a decent standard of living. In their childhood, they heard tales of the Great Depression. They grew up at a time when the minimum wage was 75 cents an hour – that's an hour of real labor, not chatting or surfing the internet. They built wealth patiently from small beginnings, via a 30-year mortgage, Social Security, and contributions to retirement plans. They knew how hard it was to put money away. The Silent Generation's hard-knocks wisdom is a long way from the smug assurance of those who have never lived without wi-fi. I don't wish ill on anyone, but I know that a time of testing is at hand for Millennials. With more than $21 trillion in debt America is moving toward a debased currency and a permanently lower standard of living. And despite the assurances of Millennial historians such as Yuval Noah Harari, war is not really a thing of the past. Another great war is coming – one America may well lose. I doubt if our adversaries will be as magnanimous as America was following WWII. Millennials seem willfully blind to these possibilities. Millennials as a group have lost sight of a fundamental law underlying all civilization. Call it self-preservation, self-interest, or simply survival. It was the great truth that Churchill cited when he rallied Britain to defense in 1940. It was what George S. Patton meant when he said, \"The object of war is not to die for your country, but to make the other bastard die for his.\" Most Millennials, I suspect, are not great Patton fans. They can't understand the wisdom underlying his salty language or his heroic life. They can't appreciate Patton because they don't accept that life involves struggle. And since that truth is at the heart of capitalist economic theory, they don't understand or accept capitalism. Socialism obscures that truth, and it does so in the service of the selfish ends of both the ruling elite and the dissolute masses. It is founded on the lie that the human species can live everywhere in peace, accepting the rule of distant bureaucracies and subsisting on an \"equal\" dole of crumbs. Inevitably, Millennials will learn from their mistakes, but the learning curve will be difficult and the consequences painful. If Millennials succeed in installing an Elizabeth Warren-like figure in the White House, it will be a long and uncertain road back to human freedom. After decades of socialism, aging Millennials may learn their lesson, but at the cost of a lifetime wasted, and the future ruined for the rest of us. Wouldn't it be better if they would just wake up?

Millennials, those born between 1982 and 2004, are the largest age cohort in American history, and according to a recent poll, most of them (44%) prefer socialism to capitalism (42%). An earlier 2015 poll found an even larger number of Millennials (53%) with a \"favorable opinion\" of socialism. Inference: America is in trouble. Maybe Donald Trump can stem the tide for another four or even eight years, but support for socialism will continue to mount as long as Millennials remain ignorant of what socialism really is. The greatest danger to this country comes from the fact that so many Millennials don't understand politics and economics. How else to explain Millennial support for Bernie Sanders, an avowed socialist? With a 75% approval rating overall, and higher among Millennials, Sanders is \"the most popular politician in the country,\" according to the Observer. According to his official website, Sanders supports a long list of liberal causes: free health care and college tuition for all, \"combating climate change to save the planet,\" \"fighting for women's rights,\" \"fighting for LGBT equality,\" \"fighting for nurses,\" \"empowering tribal nations,\" \"fighting for the rights of native Hawaiians,\" \"standing with Guam\" (huh?) – all of it paid for by \"making the wealthy pay their fair share.\" It seems that Bernie is \"fighting\" for just about everybody except straight white males and that nebulous crowd he calls \"the rich.\" Sanders intends to use the tax code to force the rich to pay more. Oddly enough, Sanders himself is one of these nefarious rich people. His net income in 2016 was over one million dollars. Nothing in the tax code prevents any taxpayer from contributing more than their required amount of tax to the federal government. So far as I know, Bernie has not done so. So it would seem that he doesn't mean it when he talks about the rich paying more, or he would have done so. Maybe Bernie is just a clever capitalist, who, along with Nancy Pelosi with her $140 million and financier husband, masquerades as a socialist. At its heart, capitalism is a liberating philosophy of life whereby individuals participate freely in markets by trading their goods or services for those of others. Under capitalism, individuals are incentivized to work by the rewards of the free market. Socialism substitutes state control and state ownership. It dictates wages and prices, creating a hugely inefficient and corrupt system that always ends in bankruptcy. Bernie's vision of the future is so hackneyed a version of all this that it would be funny if it weren't so dangerous. According to one respected website, Bernie's health care plan (\"Medicare for All\") alone would bankrupt America. Estimates of Medicare for All costs to taxpayers range from $3.1 to $14 trillion over the first decade. Bernie proposes to fund his proposal by raising taxes on the rich, but that revenue, even if it could be collected, would not be enough. With F.Y. 2018 federal spending at $4 trillion, the addition of another $855 billion in annual spending (based on an average of the estimates for Bernie's plan) involves a 21.4% tax increase (not counting funding for all of Bernie's other initiatives). Since they already pay 90% of taxes, and since Bernie rules out middle-class tax increases, this increase would fall exclusively on the top 10% of earners. So for those affluent taxpayers, Bernie's plan for health care alone would entail a tax increase of 23.75%. Meanwhile, Bernie's \"free\" college tuition plan would cost an estimated $70 billion annually. That's another 1.94% increase in federal tax for \"the rich.\" Climate change initiatives, increased regulation, and race- and gender-based giveaways would place more burdens on affluent taxpayers. Altogether, Sanders-style socialism would drive marginal federal and state rates to at least 70% in high-tax states, not counting sales tax, property tax, and countless other taxes and fees. Meanwhile, socialism promises what amounts to income for life for those who choose not to work. This being the case, who in his right mind would strive to become a successful entrepreneur – or surgeon, accountant, or business leader – when he could hang out in Boulder and smoke dope for the next forty years? There are many words to describe socialism. Having lived under communism myself, I am thoroughly familiar with the idleness, poverty, and demoralization collectivism breeds. It was commonplace to visit a restaurant in Belgrade, be handed an elaborate menu listing hundreds of choices, and then be told, \"Soup, salad, and bread – nothing else today.\" Loss of power and water in communist Yugoslavia and Bulgaria was an everyday occurrence. And secret police and neighborhood spies were everywhere. Among the old, there was bitterness, and among the young, only the ambition to get out. That to me is the essence of socialism: idleness, poverty, and repression. But how many Millennials know this? How many care to know? Not many, and not many of their teachers are making an effort to teach them about socialism. Within university departments of history, among faculty who should know better, liberals outnumber conservatives by a ratio of more than 33 to 1. With the sort of education they receive, it's not surprising that Millennials are attracted by the increasing radicalism of the Democratic Party – and given the radicalism of its base, it's not surprising that the Democratic Party is rapidly becoming openly socialist. According to Pew Research, Millennials tilt Democratic by a 51-to-35% margin. Interestingly, their grandparents (the \"Silent Generation,\" aged 69-86) have now abandoned the Democratic Party in large numbers. These voters contributed to Trump's victory in 2016. What does the Silent Generation know that Millennials don't? To begin with, they know that the world is a dangerous place. They grew up in the shadow of WWII and lived through the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War. They lived with the fear of all-out nuclear war, with reports of Soviet spying and the horrors of Chinese and North Korean communism. They learned of gulags, executions, and starvation – and they knew how fortunate they were to have been born in America. They also know how difficult it is to maintain a decent standard of living. In their childhood, they heard tales of the Great Depression. They grew up at a time when the minimum wage was 75 cents an hour – that's an hour of real labor, not chatting or surfing the internet. They built wealth patiently from small beginnings, via a 30-year mortgage, Social Security, and contributions to retirement plans. They knew how hard it was to put money away.

        "articles": "The standard narrative about today's millennials is that they are unpredictable. They are very fluid and undefined. Despite this changeability, most people automatically assume that millennials are predictably liberal. The facts, however, tell a different story. Researchers who study the habits and attitudes of millennials do not support this forgone conclusion. Indeed, liberal-minded people are finding these unpredicted results to be unsettling. To liberals, millennials are free to be unpredictable as long as they are not conservative. That is why they are irate when the find millennials holding positions they are not supposed to be holding. On some issues, they are actually more traditional than their parents. What Do Millennials Think? Millennials (born between 1982 and the early 2000s), hold a surprising set of views as they now finish high school, enter college and form families. According to sociologists Joanna Pepin of the University of Maryland and David Cotter of Union College, graduating seniors today are astonishingly more conservative than former classes. Take for example the fact that only 42% of American high school seniors in 1994 agreed that the best kind of family was one in which the man was the outside bread earner and the woman took care of the home. In 2014, 58% held this opinion. The two sides have flipped in twenty short years. Other surveys have confirmed these findings. A 2016 study was published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. It collected data from three surveys that monitored the last three generations following about 10 million American adults from 1970 to 2015. The paper found that millennials are much more likely to identify themselves as conservative than members of Generation X or even the baby boomers when they were the same age. They are also more polarized. Why Liberals Are Worried Of course, many millennials still hold very liberal views. However, the fact that significant numbers, and even majorities, hold contrary views threatens the forward motion of social and sexual revolutionary movements. When movements lose their dynamism, they easily stagnate. Many older liberals, who fought hard to push through their permissive reforms, are fearful that the millennials will ruin by their new views all the progress in the field of social equality gained since the sixties. The “gender” revolution, for example, is now stalled and looking for a jumpstart. “If they persist with these attitudes,” says researcher Dan Cotter, “they are not likely to be pushing for organizational or societal changes in those family arrangements.” Why Are Millennials Taking These Stands? Researchers can only conjecture as to why millennials are not following the liberal narrative, especially regarding the family. According to the leftist progressive view of history, youth over time should be getting more liberal, not less. One intriguing theory is that millennials are actually being consistent with what liberals preach but actually don’t practice. Researchers Pepin and Cotter attribute these attitudes to what is called “egalitarian essentialism,” a view that all views are equal including the traditional ones. If liberalism is all about freedom, they reason, then as long as women are not prevented from choosing careers, there is nothing wrong with freely choosing traditional family roles. Liberals worry that such reasoning will revert back to limiting career choices for women. It again seems that millennials should be free to choose anything they want… as long as it is not traditional. Not Enough Government Support Predictably, other scholars claim the reason for a return to more traditional values can be blamed squarely on a lack of government support. Millennials would be more open to other career and family options if they were provided with affordable childcare and paid parental leave. They claim that the lack of government programs forces millennials to resort to default solutions such as the traditional family. Massive government programs would provide the logistics for millennials to freely choose more liberal career options and promote gender equality. Such European-like welfare programs will also make Americans happy. Such simplistic analysis tends to reduce the family to an economic entity in which parental care and other family matters can be delegated to government. It tends to make happiness depend upon material success. It fails to realize that the family is more than just an economic unit. It is also a rich cultural, social and religious unit upon which all society is based. Stressed-out Families One convincing explanation is that many millennials have watched their parents try to juggle two careers and saw how stressful it was. Others saw their families fall apart with divorce or single parenthood. When the family falls apart, a whole world unravels. These millennials desire for their children the childhood they never had. Despite all the pressure to pursue options outside the family, it is no surprise that the traditional family is a real option that still draws the newer generations. It is the natural default position. Nature itself supports this ingenious union that provides for the education of children and the mutual affection of spouses. It is also no surprise that it is the only option that radical liberals insist upon excluding. They know that healthy loving families will naturally give rise to more conservative and traditional values. If these values take hold, the outcome, like millennials, will be unpredictable.

        "articles": "While renewables and nuclear power are set to be the world’s fastest-growing sources of energy through 2040, it’s fossil fuels that will still account for more than 75% of world power production for decades to come. That’s according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) latest international outlook report, which predicts that global energy consumption will rise by a whopping 28% between 2015 and 2040, with most of the growth driven by rapidly developing Asian nations. The global energy outlook lays bare what many politicians and energy sector specialists have long known to be true but have been wary of saying above a whisper, especially during the Obama years: coal is here to stay. The numbers – along with major power installation projects underway domestically and abroad – don’t lie. And while green activists might wring their hands, this energy outlook in fact represents a goldmine for the U.S. if we choose the right strategy: one focused on meeting the needs of developing economies hungry for more energy, and on investing in clean coal and similar technologies to maximize the efficiency of our nation’s new plants. While the liberal media has focused myopically on the one-off shuttering of certain coal plants as a harbinger of a carbon-free future, in fact, it’s coal-fired installations that continue to provide the backbone of electricity generation across the country. In Michigan, for instance, three nuclear power plants powered 28% of the state’s net electricity generation last year, but now, up to 10-20% of that electricity is set to evaporate after the scheduled shutdown of the Palisades nuclear plant. On top of that, U.S. natural gas production has fallen for the first time since 2005, certain states have imposed rules on fracking that could further curtail production, and natural gas prices have shot up by 50% over the past 14 months. This trend, combined with Michigan’s loss of a key source of base load power, makes it abundantly clear that coal-fired plants will have to make up the shortfall. With other states across the country relying on similar energy mixes -- overall, 19.7% from nuclear, 30.4% from coal, 33.8% from natural gas, and 14.9% from renewables -- steady and even growing reliance on coal-fired plants is set to be replicated nationwide. On top of domestic plans to increase investments in coal-powered installations, new schemes to supply allied nations with coal are also underway. In Longview, Washington, the Millennium terminal, the largest proposed coal export station in North America, is set to help energy-poor allies like Japan meet their power, national security, and economic growth needs. Japan has always lacked adequate energy resources and this shortfall grew even greater after Fukushima and the ensuing suspension of nuclear energy production. As a result, the government reevaluated the importance of imported coal to base load power and has emerged as a leader in the clean coal technology energy space. The government has plans to build an additional 48 high efficiency, low emissions power plants and is constructing two advanced gasification-based coal plants near Fukushima. Fortunately, highly developed economies like Japan have enough human and financial capital to invest in advanced coal technology projects. But that’s far from the case for developing countries, which will account for the bulk in world production and use of coal for the next 20+ years. According to the EIA, Africa, the Middle East, and other non-OECD Asian states are predicted to increase coal capacity and generation through 2040, with coal consumption in those countries growing on average 2.4% per year and accounting for 20% of total energy use. Fortunately, a number of these countries, notably India, have seen the writing on the wall and have started to push for more investment in carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology to meet their energy needs more affordably and efficiently. Earlier this summer, the government announced a new National Mission on advanced ultra supercritical technologies for clean coal utilization at a cost of $248 million, as well as the creation of two centers of excellence on clean coal technology. The government has also been prioritizing ultra high-efficiency, low-emissions technology, with plans to develop an 800-MW power plant with ultra-supercritical boilers within the next three years. But with New Delhi still struggling to bring electricity to the 20% of the public that is off the grid, it will need to collaborate with more advanced partners to achieve their energy goals. The head of the World Coal Association already said as much earlier this month when he called for India to ally with states like the U.S. to clinch cheaper funding from multilateral development banks to access more efficient technologies. Here, the U.S. has a golden opportunity to export more American commodities and know-how and to catch up with the likes of China and Japan, which have both been pumping colossal funding into power projects overseas and investing in clean energy technologies. Already, a few steps have been taken towards seizing this chance, with the administration announcing that Washington will use its vote at the World Bank, where it is the biggest shareholder, to help countries use fossil fuels more efficiently and access renewable energy sources. But in other ways, the administration has been falling short. Despite positive words for clean coal, Trump still hasn’t put his money where his mouth is, threatening to cut funding for the very department that researches CCUS by 55%. With the administration’s own EIA making it clear that coal will be on the menu for years to come, the U.S. needs to invest more in exportable technology to help developing nations gain access to reliable, affordable sources of base load power -- and to benefit from a market that is set to explode. While renewables and nuclear power are set to be the world’s fastest-growing sources of energy through 2040, it’s fossil fuels that will still account for more than 75% of world power production for decades to come. That’s according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) latest international outlook report, which predicts that global energy consumption will rise by a whopping 28% between 2015 and 2040, with most of the growth driven by rapidly developing Asian nations.

In Longview, Washington, the Millennium terminal, the largest proposed coal export station in North America, is set to help energy-poor allies like Japan meet their power, national security, and economic growth needs. Japan has always lacked adequate energy resources and this shortfall grew even greater after Fukushima and the ensuing suspension of nuclear energy production. As a result, the government reevaluated the importance of imported coal to base load power and has emerged as a leader in the clean coal technology energy space. The government has plans to build an additional 48 high efficiency, low emissions power plants and is constructing two advanced gasification-based coal plants near Fukushima. Fortunately, highly developed economies like Japan have enough human and financial capital to invest in advanced coal technology projects. But that’s far from the case for developing countries, which will account for the bulk in world production and use of coal for the next 20+ years. According to the EIA, Africa, the Middle East, and other non-OECD Asian states are predicted to increase coal capacity and generation through 2040, with coal consumption in those countries growing on average 2.4% per year and accounting for 20% of total energy use. Fortunately, a number of these countries, notably India, have seen the writing on the wall and have started to push for more investment in carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology to meet their energy needs more affordably and efficiently. Earlier this summer, the government announced a new National Mission on advanced ultra supercritical technologies for clean coal utilization at a cost of $248 million, as well as the creation of two centers of excellence on clean coal technology. The government has also been prioritizing ultra high-efficiency, low-emissions technology, with plans to develop an 800-MW power plant with ultra-supercritical boilers within the next three years. But with New Delhi still struggling to bring electricity to the 20% of the public that is off the grid, it will need to collaborate with more advanced partners to achieve their energy goals. The head of the World Coal Association already said as much earlier this month when he called for India to ally with states like the U.S. to clinch cheaper funding from multilateral development banks to access more efficient technologies. Here, the U.S. has a golden opportunity to export more American commodities and know-how and to catch up with the likes of China and Japan, which have both been pumping colossal funding into power projects overseas and investing in clean energy technologies. Already, a few steps have been taken towards seizing this chance, with the administration announcing that Washington will use its vote at the World Bank, where it is the biggest shareholder, to help countries use fossil fuels more efficiently and access renewable energy sources. But in other ways, the administration has been falling short. Despite positive words for clean coal, Trump still hasn’t put his money where his mouth is, threatening to cut funding for the very department that researches CCUS by 55%. With the administration’s own EIA making it clear that coal will be on the menu for years to come, the U.S. needs to invest more in exportable technology to help developing nations gain access to reliable, affordable sources of base load power -- and to benefit from a market that is set to explode.",

During a discussion on CNN about the shooting of Michael Brown by a white police officer, in the background was a photo of Brown in a school graduation cap and gown. Give me a break! Where was the picture from the surveillance video of the 6'4”, 290 pound thuggish Brown grabbing the store clerk by the throat after stealing cigars? The DOJ has advised news outlets not to broadcast the video of Brown assaulting the store clerk and robbing the store, claiming that it might incite violence. Okay, so allow me to make sure I understand the DOJ's logic. Rather than exposing the true character of Brown, promoting the lie that a white police officer shot a studious innocent black youth who was simply minding his own business will not spark violence? Absurd. I tip my hat to black conservative, Kevin Jackson who hung tough during a slightly contentious CNN interview. Kevin refused to allow the CNN host to get away with portraying Brown as a “choir boy.” Way to go Kevin! By the way, liberals on the Internet have called Kevin a fool. I had a similar exchange with a reporter during a radio interview about the chaos in Ferguson. However, the reporter during my interview attempted to cut me off at every turn. She had zero tolerance for any other narrative other than white cops across America are shooting young black males at will. In both Kevin and my interview, the MSM interviewers were incensed and a bit shocked that as black men, we were not all about blaming and resenting whitey. Were we Uncle Toms, stupid or what? As in the Trayvon Martin case, the MSM has launched a false narrative. Angelic Michael Brown was murdered by a racist white cop. Period. No amount of facts or truth will cause the MSM to report otherwise. What I find most disheartening about the MSM's and Leftist talking heads’ coverage of the shooting is that it is all rooted in lies, political correctness and a racist low expectation of black Americans. The term, “institutional police brutality” is being tossed around. Hogwash! The fact that Michael Brown knew he could walk into a convenience store, take whatever he wanted and assault the store clerk without consequence says that Ferguson thugs have no fear of the police. Pundits all over TV are scratching their heads about how to stop the violence and looting in Ferguson. The answer is simple. Arrest and lock up the bad guys. Unfortunately, political correctness does not allow common sense solutions. PC dictates that the police behave like impotent social workers, rather than protecting store owners from looters. PC caused police to back off, forcing store owners to arm themselves to protect their businesses from looters. The elephant in the room is the MSM's racist bigotry of low expectations. The MSM have been disproportionately critical of Ferguson police while expressing little rebuke of the thugs and looters. It has been complicit with the DOJ in hiding the character of Michael Brown. It is as if the MSM and the Left have taken the role of parents of spoiled brat children (black criminals). They refuse to acknowledge the bad behavior of their children and attack anyone who dares discipline them. As in the scenario of a parent coddling a spoiled child, the MSM and the Left hiding and ignoring bad behavior by black criminals is destructive to the black community. Epidemic black on black murder in Chicago, genocidal high black abortions, epidemic black school dropouts and black out-of wedlock births are taboo topics of the MSM. Compassionate whites that dare address these issues which are devastating the black community suffer the wrath of the Left and MSM. Ask Bill O'Reilly. And another thing, Ferguson residents are being terrorized by thugs and looters, not by the police. As a black American whom liberals have called a stupid N word on numerous occasions for touting my conservative views, I get the feeling the MSM's unspoken opinion is as followed. N****** have a right to act like n******. America should understand and compassionately tolerant it. This is pure racism and bigotry of low expectations. Stemming from our legacy of marching with Dr. King, we are a conservative, upright and moral people. A majority of black Americans, if given the truth without PC and political spin will come out on the side of justice and the law. The MSM and the Left's condescension is demeaning and insulting to black America. Thank God there are faithful black conservatives demanding a higher standard; defending the character and dignity of black America.

        "articles": "Alberta as our 51st state is not as far-fetched as it sounds at first blush. The idea was written about by Peter Zeihan in Accidental Superpower (2014) and recently broached by Holman Jenkins, Jr. in no less than the Wall Street Journal. Before diving into the politics and practicality of a Alberta leaving Canada, let's first review some background to see why such a traumatic event could even be considered. Unlike the U.S., which is netted together with the world's best river system and a favorable geography and climate, Canada is the opposite. Zeihan shows that three barriers split Canada into five largely autonomous regions. They are the Rocky Mountains, the Canadian Shield, and the St. Lawrence River. He says: Geographically, Canada just isn't a unified entity, and that's without even considering its more publicly discussed challenges such as the Anglophone-Francophone divide or the country's confederal political system, or that because of cold climate most of the Canadian landmass is simply too inhospitable to support a large population, condemning everyone to live on the country's extreme southern fringe. This makes Canada inherently unstable and unwieldy from both a political and a geographic point of view. In two significant ways, Alberta is unlike the rest of Canada. First, Alberta is energy-rich. Thanks to a several-decade-old energy boom, Alberta has a high per capita income. This results in the central government in Ottawa sucking taxes out of Alberta. For every dollar Alberta sends to Ottawa, it gets back only about 65 cents in return. This means that Albertans pay $21.8 billion more in taxes than they get back. And it is the aging population of Quebec that benefits the most from this income transfer. To make matters worse, neighboring provinces have blocked landlocked Alberta from building pipelines for its oil and gas. As for the Trudeau central government, like all progressive administrations, it is enthralled with the green movement and is anti-fossil fuel in all forms. Jenkins writes that this means that Alberta oil has to be shipped to markets by truck or rail, an expensive proposition either way, causing Edmonton's oil to sell at barely $10 a barrel – an 80% discount to world prices. Having to subsidize the rest of Canada while at the same time other Canadians try to squelch the province's energy industry has rankled many Albertans.The second factor separating Alberta from the rest of Canada is its demographics. Quoting Zeihan: Alberta's population is getting younger, more highly skilled and better-paid. As the demographic and financial disconnect between Alberta and the rest of Canada grows, these younger, more highly skilled, and better-paid Albertans will be forced to pay ever higher volumes of taxes to Ottawa to compensate for increasingly older, less skilled, and lower income Canadians elsewhere in the country. The core issue is pretty simple. While Quebecois – and to a slightly lesser degree the rest of Canada – now need Alberta to maintain their standard of living, the Albertans now need not to be part of Canada in order to maintain theirs. Landlocked as it is, Alberta could not make it as an independent country. But joining the Union has many advantages, such as alleviating much of Alberta's labor shortages in technical areas, privileged access to the U.S. market and transportation system, unlimited access to the American capital market, and inclusion in the U.S. currency zone. Why would the U.S. entertain the entry of Alberta into the union? Economics. Unlike, say, Puerto Rico, which is (and will continue to be) a welfare state and where Spanish is the native language, Alberta is vibrant, wealthy in energy, and English-speaking. Culturally, Alberta is more in sync with America than is Puerto Rico. As a state, Zeihan claims that Alberta would be per capita the richest. Some will say Democrats would object to adding a \"white\" state to the Union. Yes, but this knee-jerk racism of the Democrats could be placated by the prospect of having more tax revenue flow into Washington. As Jenkins notes, the Civil War (1861-1865) made secession illegal in the U.S. But Canada is more mannerly. Its courts have ruled that Canadian provinces have a full legal right to hold independence referenda. When the question of Quebec's secession was on the front burner, the Canadian Supreme Court in 1998 decided unanimously in favor of the legality of secession. Then, in 2000, the Canadian parliament passed a \"Clarity Act\" to lay out the political process of implementing secession.The legal framework is in place for secession if a Canadian province chooses to go that route thanks to French-speaking Quebec.Right now, the secession of Alberta from Canada seems unimaginable. But then again, in 2016, who thought the builder of glitzy casinos in Atlantic City and a reality TV show personality would be elected to the most powerful position in the world with zero political experience? Many of the fundamentals for an Alberta secession are in place. All that is needed is a precipitating event or two. Black swans happen. When they do, people, after getting over the initial shock, slap their foreheads and say, \"Of course. We should have seen it coming.\" Alberta as our 51st state is not as far-fetched as it sounds at first blush.

        "articles": "Thursday June 28 marks day 12 in the radical left wing and anarchist occupation and blockade of ICE headquarters in Portland, Oregon, organized by a group called Occupy ICE PDX. The direct action to shut down operations of the Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and investigative agency began with a small group of demonstrators on June 17. Within two days, scores of radicals, including families with children, had set up a sprawling tent city on the sidewalks and streets surrounding the building, effectively shutting it down. By week’s end, hundreds of “comrades” had been lured by social media to join the campaign, as it served to inspire similar provocative illegal actions around the country. According to Willamette Week, “The Portland occupation, the first nationwide, is an attempt to disrupt President Donald Trump's ‘zero tolerance’ policy that has treated refugees seeking asylum as criminals and separated small children from their parents.” National mainstream television and cable news coverage of these developments in Portland has continued to be largely nonexistent. The fact that the movement has gone nationwide has also been ignored. Several Internet political publications, including American Thinker on June 25, have reported on the story, as have a few major newspapers. In contrast, the radical ragtag “Occupy Movement” demonstrations in the fall of 2011 grabbed major media coverage including on TV from the outset of the first one, Occupy Wall Street. It’s plausible that the widespread coverage of obnoxious and potentially criminal actions that have been taken place, and their potential impact to harm Democrat candidates in the fall, have discouraged the MSM from reporting on the equally obnoxious radical encampments in Portland and other cities. The groups behind the Portland and allied anti-ICE actions include Antifa, DSA (Democrat Socialists of America), Direct Action, and various anarchists, socialists, and communist fellow travelers. The official Occupy I.C.E. PDX Twitter account makes the group’s agenda clear: “We won’t leave until I.C.E is out of Portland and is abolished!” and “ICE = GESTAPO.” The radical left wing Democrat mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, is in sync with the occupiers and has ordered Portland police to stand down and not enforce the laws against such actions. Other Portland political leaders are even more dedicated to kowtowing to the occupiers and shutting down ICE in the city. According to a Washington Post article reprinted at SFGate: City Councilmember Chloe Eudaly said at a meeting Wednesday [June 27] that her office is looking into the possibility of revoking ICE’s lease at the Portland building. Margaux Weeke, a spokeswoman for Eudaly, said the office is looking into options for removing ICE: “We are definitely very supportive of the occupy movement. We're doing our very best to support everything that they're doing.” Among the “dozens of cities nationwide” where groups of radicals have occupied or blocked ICE buildings are San Diego, Los Angeles, New York, Detroit, San Francisco, Chicago, and Pittsburgh. Demonstrators to date have had some success in shutting down ICE operations. For example, as Al Jazeera reported in an article on June 27: On Monday [June 25], #OccupyICENYC forced the agency to temporarily cancel a series of immigration hearings, with officials citing a need to ‘ensure the safety of ICE employees, the court, the public and detainees,’ according to local media. Source: Occupy ICE NYC Twitter In recent days, prominent national Democrats have started to echo the Occupy ICE street radicals’ demands to shut down ICE. Support for this ultimatum to in effect nullify the law is quickly becoming an article of faith for Democrat candidates running for office this year and some presidential wannabes with their eyes set on challenging President Trump in 2020. High profile Dems jumping on the abolish ICE bandwagon include 2020 presidential hopeful Senator Kamala Harris (CA), New York Gubernatorial candidate, Sex and the City actress, and lesbian activist Cynthia Nixon, and a number of current Representatives and at least 15 candidates for the House, including the surprise winner of New York’s 14th Congressional District Democrat primary. That new rising star of the left, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was a member of the DSA who was working as a bartender seven months ago. According to the Washington Post, Ocasio-Cortez “made ‘abolish ICE’ a centerpiece of her campaign, with bilingual ‘Abolish ICE/Elimina Ice’ posters appearing in shop windows across Queens and the Bronx.” On Monday, Representative Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, introduced legislation in the House of Representatives that would abolish the agency. ICE was established in 2003 as part of the Department of Homeland Security that was a result of legislation passed after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. ICE’s 2018 budget is $7.6 billion and it employs over 20,000 people. ICE is responsible for much more than enforcing immigration laws. The agency “executes its mission through the enforcement of more than 400 federal statutes, focusing on preventing terrorism, immigration enforcement and combating transnational crime.” ICE also “maintains attachés at major U.S. diplomatic missions overseas.” The recent clarion call to shut down ICE altogether is part of a larger agenda by this latest incarnation of the seven year-old Occupy movement and its wide variety of radical adherents. More broadly, the movement is also “demanding” the closure of prisons and the opening of borders. In other words, stick a dagger in the heart of law enforcement by freeing convicted criminals from jails and prisons and give up trying to keep illegal aliens out of the country because these policies – law and order and borders – are “racist.” The Portland ICE HQ occupation has grown in numbers (more than 90 tents and hundreds of participants as of June 25) and has hardened its encampment with barricades made of wooden pallets, heavy tarps, and other material. Overnight last Monday, a small number of Federal officers managed to sneak into the building as the protesters were asleep. They started removing banners the demonstrators had attached to the building’s exterior and the next day began passing out fliers warning the tent city occupiers that they would be subject to arrest. As of late Wednesday June 27, no arrests had been made and no one had been evicted from the sprawling and ever expanding tent city. A look inside Portland occupy ICE camps Source: Portland Oregonian The warnings seemed to only harden the resolve of the occupiers. When a few federal officers were spotted in the area on June 27, an occupier tweeted “Homeland [DHS] chuds are here, SEND FUC–NG BODIES NOW #OccupyICEPDX.” According to Urban Dictionary, CHUD “is the acronym for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dweller. This term is regarded as the WORST possible insult you can dish out on the social media circles today.” According to an article on June 27 in The Oregonian, Occupy ICE Portland leaders have promised that, if arrests are made and the encampment is shut down: “People are going to do whatever it takes,” Jacob Bureros, an organizer of the Occupy ICE PDX movement, said Tuesday. “If they arrest us on federal property, we'll shut the roads down. You can't stop us. They’re going to find out that this city has more resolve than they do.” On June 26, Williamette Week described how occupation leaders have already arranged with the city’s legions of public defenders, who normally represent illegal aliens, to vigorously defend anyone arrested at Portland’s ICE HQ. Local Portland mainstream media – print, online, TV, and radio – are reporting daily on the occupation. The coverage is generally positive, as befits a city that might as well be named The People’s Republic of Portland. Local left wing “community” radio station KBOO-FM has been broadcasting live from the encampment. The most common question people ask about this situation is a variation of “How long will this be allowed to go on?” Source: Occupy ICE NYC Twitter Peter Barry Chowka is a veteran reporter and analyst of news on national politics, media, and popular culture.

High profile Dems jumping on the abolish ICE bandwagon include 2020 presidential hopeful Senator Kamala Harris (CA), New York Gubernatorial candidate, Sex and the City actress, and lesbian activist Cynthia Nixon, and a number of current Representatives and at least 15 candidates for the House, including the surprise winner of New York’s 14th Congressional District Democrat primary. That new rising star of the left, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was a member of the DSA who was working as a bartender seven months ago. According to the Washington Post, Ocasio-Cortez “made ‘abolish ICE’ a centerpiece of her campaign, with bilingual ‘Abolish ICE/Elimina Ice’ posters appearing in shop windows across Queens and the Bronx.” On Monday, Representative Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, introduced legislation in the House of Representatives that would abolish the agency. ICE was established in 2003 as part of the Department of Homeland Security that was a result of legislation passed after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. ICE’s 2018 budget is $7.6 billion and it employs over 20,000 people. ICE is responsible for much more than enforcing immigration laws. The agency “executes its mission through the enforcement of more than 400 federal statutes, focusing on preventing terrorism, immigration enforcement and combating transnational crime.” ICE also “maintains attachés at major U.S. diplomatic missions overseas.” The recent clarion call to shut down ICE altogether is part of a larger agenda by this latest incarnation of the seven year-old Occupy movement and its wide variety of radical adherents. More broadly, the movement is also “demanding” the closure of prisons and the opening of borders. In other words, stick a dagger in the heart of law enforcement by freeing convicted criminals from jails and prisons and give up trying to keep illegal aliens out of the country because these policies – law and order and borders – are “racist.” The Portland ICE HQ occupation has grown in numbers (more than 90 tents and hundreds of participants as of June 25) and has hardened its encampment with barricades made of wooden pallets, heavy tarps, and other material. Overnight last Monday, a small number of Federal officers managed to sneak into the building as the protesters were asleep. They started removing banners the demonstrators had attached to the building’s exterior and the next day began passing out fliers warning the tent city occupiers that they would be subject to arrest. As of late Wednesday June 27, no arrests had been made and no one had been evicted from the sprawling and ever expanding tent city. A look inside Portland occupy ICE camps Source: Portland Oregonian The warnings seemed to only harden the resolve of the occupiers. When a few federal officers were spotted in the area on June 27, an occupier tweeted “Homeland [DHS] chuds are here, SEND FUC–NG BODIES NOW #OccupyICEPDX.” According to Urban Dictionary, CHUD “is the acronym for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dweller. This term is regarded as the WORST possible insult you can dish out on the social media circles today.” According to an article on June 27 in The Oregonian, Occupy ICE Portland leaders have promised that, if arrests are made and the encampment is shut down: “People are going to do whatever it takes,” Jacob Bureros, an organizer of the Occupy ICE PDX movement, said Tuesday. “If they arrest us on federal property, we'll shut the roads down. You can't stop us. They’re going to find out that this city has more resolve than they do.” On June 26, Williamette Week described how occupation leaders have already arranged with the city’s legions of public defenders, who normally represent illegal aliens, to vigorously defend anyone arrested at Portland’s ICE HQ. Local Portland mainstream media – print, online, TV, and radio – are reporting daily on the occupation. The coverage is generally positive, as befits a city that might as well be named The People’s Republic of Portland. Local left wing “community” radio station KBOO-FM has been broadcasting live from the encampment. The most common question people ask about this situation is a variation of “How long will this be allowed to go on?” Source: Occupy ICE NYC Twitter Peter Barry Chowka is a veteran reporter and analyst of news on national politics, media, and popular culture.

Thursday June 28 marks day 12 in the radical left wing and anarchist occupation and blockade of ICE headquarters in Portland, Oregon, organized by a group called Occupy ICE PDX. The direct action to shut down operations of the Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and investigative agency began with a small group of demonstrators on June 17. Within two days, scores of radicals, including families with children, had set up a sprawling tent city on the sidewalks and streets surrounding the building, effectively shutting it down. By week’s end, hundreds of “comrades” had been lured by social media to join the campaign, as it served to inspire similar provocative illegal actions around the country. According to Willamette Week, “The Portland occupation, the first nationwide, is an attempt to disrupt President Donald Trump's ‘zero tolerance’ policy that has treated refugees seeking asylum as criminals and separated small children from their parents.” National mainstream television and cable news coverage of these developments in Portland has continued to be largely nonexistent. The fact that the movement has gone nationwide has also been ignored. Several Internet political publications, including American Thinker on June 25, have reported on the story, as have a few major newspapers. In contrast, the radical ragtag “Occupy Movement” demonstrations in the fall of 2011 grabbed major media coverage including on TV from the outset of the first one, Occupy Wall Street. It’s plausible that the widespread coverage of obnoxious and potentially criminal actions that have been taken place, and their potential impact to harm Democrat candidates in the fall, have discouraged the MSM from reporting on the equally obnoxious radical encampments in Portland and other cities. Part of the Occupy Portland ICE tent city Photo: Daniel Stindt, Occupy ICE The groups behind the Portland and allied anti-ICE actions include Antifa, DSA (Democrat Socialists of America), Direct Action, and various anarchists, socialists, and communist fellow travelers. The official Occupy I.C.E. PDX Twitter account makes the group’s agenda clear: “We won’t leave until I.C.E is out of Portland and is abolished!” and “ICE = GESTAPO.” The radical left wing Democrat mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, is in sync with the occupiers and has ordered Portland police to stand down and not enforce the laws against such actions. Other Portland political leaders are even more dedicated to kowtowing to the occupiers and shutting down ICE in the city. According to a Washington Post article reprinted at SFGate: City Councilmember Chloe Eudaly said at a meeting Wednesday [June 27] that her office is looking into the possibility of revoking ICE’s lease at the Portland building. Margaux Weeke, a spokeswoman for Eudaly, said the office is looking into options for removing ICE: “We are definitely very supportive of the occupy movement. We're doing our very best to support everything that they're doing.” Among the “dozens of cities nationwide” where groups of radicals have occupied or blocked ICE buildings are San Diego, Los Angeles, New York, Detroit, San Francisco, Chicago, and Pittsburgh. Demonstrators to date have had some success in shutting down ICE operations. For example, as Al Jazeera reported in an article on June 27: On Monday [June 25], #OccupyICENYC forced the agency to temporarily cancel a series of immigration hearings, with officials citing a need to ‘ensure the safety of ICE employees, the court, the public and detainees,’ according to local media.

The owners of the New York Times and the Washington Post certainly know what freedom of the press means. More importantly, they know what they want us to believe. In their lèse-majesté world, \"the press\" spoken of in the First Amendment is the credentialed, organized, established press. Only this press is afforded the superior First Amendment protections in the Constitution. Or so they would have us believe. For the most part, in the popular imagination, the organized press is winning this battle of interpretation. To prove it, ask yourself: are bloggers, wearing pajamas, \"the press\"? Whatever your politics, are rogue, disruptive individuals like James O'Keefe, who go undercover in the manner made famous by 60 Minutes, also \"the press\"? Or, even more pointedly, in a case currently being argued in the Southern District of New York, when the CIA discloses information to \"trusted reporters\" at the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times, is the CIA then obligated to release that same information to an \"independent\" unaffiliated citizen-journalist? The CIA says no. Judge Colleen McMahon, to her credit, has initially rejected the CIA argument. Is this privileged, self-serving view of the Press Clause legally correct? What if freedom of the press means an actual, you know, press, as in printing press? First Amendment scholar Eugene Volokh has comprehensively surveyed these two alternative meanings. His conclusion: legally speaking, it is no contest, and decisively consistent across time. Freedom of the press protects all users of the printing press. The protection attaches to the technology. There is no special protection enshrined in the Constitution for the press as a profession. Freedom of the press \"secur[es] a right of every person to use communications technology, not just a right belonging to members of the publishing industry.\" Even more surprising, this position is controlling in Supreme Court opinions. As summarized by Professor Volokh: Throughout that time [from 1931 to the present], it turns out, the press-as-technology view has been dominant, and it continues to be dominant today. Many Supreme Court cases have officially endorsed this view. No Supreme Court case has rejected this view (though some cases have suggested the question remains open). That is not to say the organized press organs have abandoned their cause. On occasion, they have received a receptive hearing, most disturbingly garnering four votes in dissent in the case of Citizens United v. FEC, asserting that \"one type of corporation, those that are part of the press, might be able to claim special First Amendment status.\" It is the dissenting words of Justice Stewart, sounding from a bygone era, that represent the fondest hope of established media. Said Justice Stewart, \"The primary purpose of the constitutional guarantee of free press was ... to create a fourth institution outside the Government as an additional check on the three official branches.\" Though the constitutional argument is seemingly, and hopefully, settled, most of us are not lawyers, and increasingly, it does not matter. What does matter is that the organized media club perceives itself as specially protected. It seeks special privileges. It awards itself special honors. It insists on its moral superiority. And it certainly behaves as though freedom of the press uniquely meant freedom of the institutional press. Here is the real fight, and it is not one properly left to well paid lawyers in First Amendment litigation. At issue is the public understanding of the press in the modern internet era. Will we as citizens accede to this legal wrong? Will we continue to accord the established press the privilege and respect that it would have us believe, falsely, resides in the First Amendment? There is a term for such self-deception, developed by a psychology and cognitive science professor at Yale, Tamar Gendler. In layman's terms, an alief is a belief that we know to be wrong but nonetheless accept as true and, more to the point, act upon as true. In politics, it is the use of dehumanizing language and imagery to undermine an opponent or class of individuals. The invented symbol becomes reality. In psychology, an experiment has people label a bottle of plain water as poison. The self-made label alone makes them averse to drinking a liquid they know to be harmless. More vividly, people can form household flour into the shape and color of poop, and it becomes immediately less desirable. As applied to the press, the alief is that the organized press holds a special, constitutionally ratified higher status in our society. It is an alief closely aligned with another modern affliction of credentialism. Wear the label of a first-rate institution, and forever after, you will be accorded the respect and status of an elite. In part, the elite status of the organized media is collapsing of its own weight. Newsweek sells for a dollar; the Washington Post becomes a vanity press funded by America's only quadzillionaire, Jeff Bezos; and CNN sees it audience decline by 30%. Independent of economic trends, leading press personages figure largely in the recent wave of sexual harassment allegations and resignations. Like sunlight, failure and disgrace are effective disinfectants. The problem is that for all the well advertised decline in the mainstream media, they still are the primary conduit for shaping public opinion. Nowhere is this truer than in matters of politics and public policy – and elections. It is in this sense vital to appreciate that our freedom to disseminate ideas in written form inheres in the press itself, in the technology of the press. It is the right of every single American. The organized media have no place of honor here. Muhammad Ali famously said, in what George Plimpton termed the shortest poem in the English language, \"Me We.\" The Me in publishing is morphing at astronomical rates to We. In our daily lives, we are all become printing presses, on social media, Reddit threads, blog posts, video uploads, podcasts, comments, online content. We are all protected. The fight that needs to be won is the well earned push off the pedestal for organized media. They are not our betters. Increasingly, they are not our equals. To fight organized media effectively, to break the alief of a privileged institutional press, the First Amendment must be framed visually. We must see freedom of the press exactly for what it is: the right inhering in us all to make use of a press to disseminate ideas. That includes the digital press in our hands, on our desks, or responding our voices. For legal support, Professor Volokh is reassuring: Supreme Court majority opinions have continued to provide equal treatment to speakers without regard to whether they are members of the press as industry...[T]he bulk of the precedents point towards equal treatment for all speakers – or at least to equal treatment for all who use mass communications technologies, whether or not they are members of the press as industry. But it is the public understanding that needs to win out. Our First Amendment right is the direct lineal descendant of Gutenberg's press. With a mere screw and movable bar, the Gutenberg press was largely unchanged, though improved for mass output, over three hundred and fifty years, through to our founding. Insert block type in a frame, cover with paper, press for the printed text. That's it. It is not complicated. That is our First Amendment freedom of the press. Let's use it. William Levin is a graduate of Yale Law School and an investment banker in New York. Familiarity can breed contempt, and also boredom and neglect. Take freedom of the press.

This includes some families but mostly the self-employed. It's also important to note that this is a feature, not a bug, of Obamacare. The ACA was designed to destroy the individual insurance market, largely because health insurance gurus see it as \"inefficient.\" Weekly Standard: According to health policy expert Bob Laszewski, roughly 16 million Americans will lose their current plans because of Obamacare: The U.S. individual health insurance market currently totals about 19 million people. Because the Obama administration's regulations on grandfathering existing plans were so stringent about 85% of those, 16 million, are not grandfathered and must comply with Obamacare at their next renewal. The rules are very complex. For example, if you had an individual plan in March of 2010 when the law was passed and you only increased the deductible from $1,000 to $1,500 in the years since, your plan has lost its grandfather status and it will no longer be available to you when it would have renewed in 2014.These 16 million people are now receiving letters from their carriers saying they are losing their current coverage and must re-enroll in order to avoid a break in coverage and comply with the new health law's benefit mandates--the vast majority by January 1. Most of these will be seeing some pretty big rate increases. Kaiser Health News called up a few insurers around the country and found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have already received cancellation notices. \"[T]he cancellation notices, which began arriving in August, have shocked many consumers in light of President Barack Obama's promise that people could keep their plans if they liked them,\" according to Kaiser Health News reporters Anna Gorman and Julie Appleby. \"Florida Blue, for example, is terminating about 300,000 policies, about 80 percent of its individual policies in the state. Kaiser Permanente in California has sent notices to 160,000 people - about half of its individual business in the state. Insurer Highmark in Pittsburgh is dropping about 20 percent of its individual market customers, while Independence Blue Cross, the major insurer in Philadelphia, is dropping about 45 percent,\" Kaiser reports. \"Blue Shield of California sent roughly 119,000 cancellation notices out in mid-September, about 60 percent of its individual business. About two-thirds of those policyholders will see rate increases in their new policies, said spokesman Steve Shivinsky.\" An astonishing fact, as Heritage points out: Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that in 2014, Obamacare would enroll 7 million people in exchange coverage and 9 million people through Medicaid. (Medicaid's problems with physician access and patient outcomes are so widespread that some beneficiaries don't consider the program \"real insurance,\" but that's a separate story.) The CBO total of 16 million who will gain coverage is exactly equal to the 16 million Robert Laszewski estimates will lose their existing health plans due to Obamacare's new mandates. But based on the opening weeks of Obamacare's open enrollment period, it's far from certain that the CBO's estimate of 7 million exchange enrollees will be reached. Laszewski estimates that only 20,000 people have actually enrolled in health plans in the 34 states using a federally run exchange. Based on internal Administration estimates obtained by the Associated Press and released earlier this week, enrollment is well behind even its meager projections for the first few weeks of open enrollment. Moreover, the ongoing technical difficulties faced by insurance companies and users alike give little prospect for massive new uptake any time soon. Given the ongoing exchange chaos, it's entirely likely that Obamacare could result in more people losing their current health insurance next year than obtaining new coverage. Any way you slice it, that's not reform. (my emphasis) The administration's favorite think tank - Center for American Progress - boasts that \"The Affordable Care Act's Lower-Than-Projected Premiums Will Save $190 Billion.\" What they don't mention is that those lower preiums include double or triple the deductible of their old plans. The bottom line is that consumers are going to spend more out of pocket cash on health care than before. And that ain't \"reform\" either.

My online friend, hit and run, characterized the usual political dialogue: Prog[ressive]s: \"We need a national conversation on race!\" Conservatives: \"No, we don't.\" Progs: \"See? That just proves you're racist!\" MSM [Mainstream Media]: \"Race. Race, race. Race, race, race. Also, race.\" Conservatives: \"Fine. Let's have a conversation. Looking at the stats, it is worth noting that in the black community......\" Progs: \"How dare you talk about race, you racist!\" ... Progs: \"We need a national conversation on rape culture!\" Conservatives: \"No, we don't.\" Progs: \"See? That just proves you're pro-rape!\" MSM: \"Rape culture. Rape, rape culture. Rape, rape, rape culture. Also, rape culture.\" Conservatives: \"Fine. Let's have a conversation. Looking at the stats, it is worth noting that rapes on college campuses have declined......\" Progs: \"How dare you talk about stats when even one rape is too many, you rape apologist!\" For decades, greenies have said we must impoverish ourselves and switch to costly, inefficient sources of energy because we are approaching “peak oil” and the world will soon run out of this valuable resource. With new sources of petroleum energy turning up almost everywhere on earth, the claim has proven hollow. In his usual colorful language, Rick Ballard characterized the left wing’s dilemma, playing off that phrase: I'm sure a Gruber can be found to gin up a model to contrast with reality but prog[ressive]s are finding chimera invention and maintenance rather exhausting. Perhaps they should combine a few to make their lying lives easier? What's wrong with 'Peak SkyDragon Oil Glut'? Or 'Increased Thug Deaths Accompany Fraternity Gang Rapes'? Alternatively, perhaps we've reached Peak Stupidity. In a more leisurely romp through the years’ progressive belly flops, Robert Tracinski calls it the year of Ben Trovato, a name taken from an Italian adage meaning “if it’s not true, it’s a good story”. Among the false narratives peddled by the left last year, he counts the following: I’m sure with time we could all add to this list of Ben Trovato’s work this past year, but climatology, rape, and sexism seem to have led the way. Speaking of racism, it’s way past time that when accused of it, the Republicans stop sucking their thumbs and whenever any colleague is accused of it, quit dashing for the exits. Last week saw the rise and fall of Ben Trovato’s hit job on Congressman Steve Scalise, who was accused of speaking 12 years ago to a group affiliated with David Duke. When sandbagged by the charge -- leveled by the son of a former opponent whom he’d trounced -- Scalise said he remembered speaking to a lot of civic groups in the period about fiscal matters and indicated if one of those groups was involved, he was sorry. No one even charged that he was a racist-- even Democrats in his home state denied that, as a matter of fact. No one even charged that he’d endorsed Duke’s racist remarks nor challenged his assertion that his speech was on fiscal matters involving the state. From that came the usual -- white toga conservatives, more concerned with preserving a spotless reputation than with standing up for fair treatment of their colleagues -- demanded he resign his position as House Majority Whip . As the week wore on, it appeared the story was false. He’d not spoken to that group, but to another civic group earlier that day as the organizer of both events admitted and the program of the Duke supporters revealed. Jimmyk, posting before the entire story collapsed, discussed the dynamics of the Republicans’ failure to adequately respond in Scalise’s defense: “Scalise's faux pas was clearly an aberration, an oversight from more than 12 years ago. There is no pattern of behavior that I'm aware of. However he handles it, it's clear GOP politicians are afraid to attack Democrats for much more blatant associations like Sharpton and Rev Wright, so the dirty work is left to politicians who are perceived as more on the fringe, like Bachman or Newt, and it becomes self-reinforcing.” In any event, it’s clear that even when the story falls apart and there is no “racist” angle, the press will continue to bang that drum: Friday’s Washington Post contained an editorial by Eugene Robinson with the erroneous facts stated as truth, and Saturday's Post ran a cartoon from the Atlanta Journal Constitution, showing Scalise addressing the Ku Klux Klan. To refuse to strike back is to once again let the leftists seize the ground. Thomas Sowell said it nicely: There are few modest talents so richly rewarded -- especially in politics and the media -- as the ability to portray parasites as victims, and portray demands for preferential treatment as struggles for equal rights. Republicans complain when Democrats call them racists. But when have you ever heard a Republican counterattack? You don’t win by protesting your innocence or whining about the unfairness of the charge. Yet when have you heard a Republican reply by saying, “You’re a lying demagogue without a speck of evidence. Put up or shut up!” I couldn’t agree more. At some point you have to stop defending cowardly behavior as high-minded civilized turn-the-other-cheek behavior, and start telling the unvarnished truth about the attacks and attackers: to refuse to defend your colleagues against base, unproven or overblown charges is just plain pusillanimous.

        "articles": "Now we're told at this early date to \"get over it.\" We being those conservatives who aggressively opposed Donald Trump, of course. So what exactly should we get over? What does getting over it look like? Let’s explore. This notion was floated by no less than my friend, colleague and editor of more than eight years, Thomas Lifson, on this site yesterday. The same sentiment was parroted across the internet and on talk radio yesterday as well. Much of it by people with far less interest in serious adult conversation than Lifson. I say far less serious because I don't think a single pro Trump commenter to my article yesterday addressed the direct Trump quotes I presented. Many of my comments below are directed at that mindset, not at Dr. Lifson’s. And as Thomas knows, I both praised and criticized Trump here in April...of 2011...in American Thinker. My position on Trump has been totally consistent for more than five years. That is not a universal trait. For five plus years I've warned about Trump -- while praising him on many levels. I recognized the good and the bad. Thus, no I'm not over anything at the moment. I've been warning about this since before Huckabee won Iowa. So back to what it is we should get over: If you simply mean we should vote Trump to keep Hillary out of the White House, then I may already be \"over it.” Or I might be by November. But if you think I'm going to let anyone off the hook for disastrous decisions? No way, Jose (a little border lingo). So if the \"get over it\" posture is your position, may I inquire if this the standard Trump supporters will apply to themselves on the morning after Election Day 2016 if Hillary Clinton wins? Hey, she won. No biggie. I'm \"over it.\" Yeah, right. For the record, I'm not among those who think that Trump will certainly lose to Hillary. I believe Hillary is capable of losing to anyone, Trump included. So if that happens, for example, will you apply that same quickie \"get over it\" standard the day President Trump suggests replacing ObamaCare with something worse because he's \"gonna be fantastic for women's health care\" and conservatives are \"cruel and heartless\"? Or signs a bill funding Planned Parenthood after \"making a deal\" with Chuck Schumer? Or sics the Internal Revenue Service on companies in your 401K portfolio because he doesn't like where they make products? Or extends ethanol subsidies so your gas and your food both cost more while the corn distillate destroys your engine? Or plays golf with his big buddy John Boehner and a day later gives Nancy Pelosi everything she wants? Or for that matter, when he does anything that flies in the face of his \"position papers\" on his website -- words he clearly never read, let alone wrote? Words he contradicted every time he was in front of an open mic? Will you merely get over it? These are serious concerns about Trump, and they remain today. And if any of us who opposed Trump were over it today, then that would be a sad commentary on our depth of understanding and commitment. I have never gotten over a bad election result that quickly, and I never will. And it's the elections that matter, not the candidate. This is about the country. We are on the precipice of a fantastic opportunity and we have squandered it. Hell no, I am not over that. And what I'm not over is far deeper than the idea that my favorite choice didn't win. That's not the issue. That little part I am over. But no, I am not over the Constitution, although apparently many are, because they have thrown in with a man who never mentions it and often runs afoul of it. Donald Trump was born \"over\" the Constitution and still is. He's never been concerned with it. New York values don’t intersect with the Constitution. No, I am not over the idea of liberty, and thus I'm not quite over the fact that the Republican nominee is a man totally unfamiliar with this concept and a man who never ever looks at increased liberty as the answer for out of control government. Ever. Please, show me where I am wrong on that. Nor am I over the related concept of limited government. Nothing, not a single syllable out of Donald Trump's mouth, has uttered a whiff of anything to do with limited government. When Carrier and Ford are forced offshore because of out of control government, what does Donald do? He threatens even more government power as the solution. It never even dawns on the Orange One or his followers to perhaps remove some of the government obstacles in the way of Carrier, Ford and other once free companies. What an idea! When crony capitalism is destroying our free market, does Donald want to stop government from picking winners and losers? NO! He doubles down on ethanol subsidies. He obfuscates the issue of eminent domain. And he rails against trade, not even considering the obvious conclusion that the big stick of tariffs is centralized planning and government picking winners and losers on steroids. And I'm not over fighting the establishment either -- something I've been doing since 1992 -- and yet daily I get savaged by many who likely didn't understand the concept until maybe 2014 -- if at all. My first establishment target in 1992 was John McCain, even having a heated argument with G. Gordon Liddy about McCain in early 1993. There was no palpable anti-McCain sentiment until at least 2005-6. I was alone here. I owned the web URL www.firekarlrove in 2001. Yes, 2001. Think about that for a minute. When did you figure Rove out? Just asking. So certainly everyone is perfectly within their rights to call anyone an establishment hack, because in this country you are perfectly free to be embarrassingly wrong. Speaking of which, the notion that Trump is this great wrecking ball to the establishment would be laughable if it weren't so serious. Trump is the establishment. His big check to party boss and establishment poster child Mitch McConnell has barely even cleared yet -- a donation he followed up by insulting on Twitter those stupid Kentuckians who were willing to forgo McConnell's crony gravy train to his home state in favor of a principled man like Matt Bevin. Trump brags he has been giving to Republicans lately, but these donations are to establishment Republicans running against outsiders! So no, I'm not over this kind of House of Cards attitude, and if you are, then you were never really in the fight to begin with. You've been conned. Alexander Hamilton said “if we must have an enemy at the head of Government, let it be one whom we can oppose, and for whom we are not responsible, who will not involve our party in the disgrace of his foolish and bad measures.” He was right. Many of you haven not heeded that lesson. I have, and I am proudly not over the nomination of big government New York liberal Donald J Trump. Edmund Wright is contributor to American Thinker, Breitbart, Newsmax TV and Talk Radio Network. He has been exposing and opposing the establishment since 1992. Now we're told at this early date to \"get over it.\" We being those conservatives who aggressively opposed Donald Trump, of course. So what exactly should we get over?

So no, I'm not over this kind of House of Cards attitude, and if you are, then you were never really in the fight to begin with. You've been conned. Alexander Hamilton said “if we must have an enemy at the head of Government, let it be one whom we can oppose, and for whom we are not responsible, who will not involve our party in the disgrace of his foolish and bad measures.” He was right. Many of you haven not heeded that lesson. I have, and I am proudly not over the nomination of big government New York liberal Donald J Trump.

        "articles": "Based on President Obama's actions of the past seven years, one can surmise that his worldview is based on three major premises. His economic perspective is deliberately aimed at weakening the United States. Thus, despite the disastrous past history of mandated government directives that forced banks to provide sub-prime loans, Obama and company are at it again forcing banks to engage in risky loans. In \"separate new reports to Congress, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reveal Obama regulators are pressuring them to back high-risk home loans for 'very low-income' borrowers.\" Both mortgage companies are being \"forced to accept mortgages with as little as 3% down.\" And most telling, they must \"[y]ield disparate results based on the race of the borrower.\" If that were not enough, one learns that the government is allowing \"lenders to use unemployment benefits as source of income.\" And these mandates will not expire until 2019. So here is a recipe for unmitigated economic disaster. Another of the downward economic spirals produced by Obama and his minions is the looming student loan crisis, which is being manufactured and perpetuated by this White House. Twenty-seven percent of student loans are delinquent, of about one trillion dollars of student loan debt owed to the federal government. And while Obama continues to harangue about the difficulties that students have concerning mounting college costs, the real problem is that \"in 2010 Obama eliminated the federal guaranteed loan program,” which \"let private lenders offer student loans at low interest rates.\" But as with everything that Obama touches, now there is only one place to get a loan -- big government. Consequently \"federal direct student loan debt has climbed by more than $100 billion.\" But Obama, the compassionate, has made it increasingly easier for students to avoid paying back student loans in full; thus, it is a problem that American taxpayers will have to shoulder -- along with the $18 trillion+ debt, courtesy of Obama. Obama's second premise is that America must pay mightily for its success and its hubris. To that end, Obama concedes all safety precautions that a leader would insist upon in dealing with \"Death-to-America\"-chanting Iran. But one need only consider Obama's reaction to the 9-11-2001 attacks to understand his moral compass and his antipathy to the United States. On September 19, 2001 a story ran in the Hyde Park Herald containing then-State-Senator Barack Obama's response to the 9-11 events. Obama had this to say of the heinous actions of that day We must also engage, however, in the more difficult task of understanding the sources of such madness. The essence of this tragedy, it seems to me, derives from a fundamental absence of empathy on the part of the attackers: an inability to imagine, or connect with, the humanity and suffering of others. Such a failure of empathy, such numbness to the pain of a child or the desperation of a parent, is not innate; nor, history tells us, is it unique to a particular culture, religion, or ethnicity. It may find expression in a particular brand of violence, and may be channeled by particular demagogues or fanatics. Most often, though, it grows out of a climate of poverty and ignorance, helplessness and despair. So with 3,000 Americans dead, and with fears of more terror to emerge, Obama was concerned with the murderers’ \"despair.\" Not once did he use the term “terrorism.” Not once did he speak of an ultimatum response towards the jihadists. Instead this Islam-educated man seeks compromise and a meeting of the minds with people who in twenty minutes just changed the entire landscape of this country. Instead Americans are supposed to \"imagine the sufferings\" of murderers. Are we then surprised when only a decade and half later, Marie Harf parrots her boss and asserts that America needs, \"in the medium and longer term to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups.” One root cause, she went on to explain, was a lack of “gainful employment.\" That shouldn't be too difficult with the porous southern border that Obama continues to exploit with his unconstitutional maneuvers on illegal immigration. And, courtesy of the American taxpayer, Obama is flying in more illegals. Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, confirmed that under the State Department program, the Obama administration will fly children at taxpayer expense into the U.S. as refugees, and the ones who don’t qualify as refugees are going to be admitted under parole. What it amounts to is that President Obama just gets to admit whoever he wants to let into the country. But the leader of the free world has the temerity to castigate those who question Loretta Lynch's confirmation as U.S. attorney general even while she admits she will not adhere to federal immigration law, but will merely be the latest in the line-up of Obama's minions for whom the Constitution is an impediment. It is high time for the Liar-in-Chief to be embarrassed. But shame and embarrassment occur only when there is the awareness of having done something wrong or foolish. Obama's worldview is not consistent with the foundational heart of America's founding. He sees nothing wrong whatsoever in his actions. Thus, his opprobrium against America continues because we, as a nation, are wrong. Our values are distorted; our strengths are our weaknesses; our foundations are ill-begotten and need to be dismantled. His contempt for the nation is the correct reaction for Obama. And thus, we find Obama will agree to a \"phased-in relief to sanctions\" for Iran with absolutely nothing in return but empty gestures. In other words, Iran has merely to sign a piece of paper and, voila, it will \"gain access to these funds [between $100 billion and $140 billion]. As Lori Lowenthal Marcus writes, \"[t]hink of it as a signing bonus given to desired major league players just for agreeing to come join the team, without ever having to even pick up the ball to play.\" Consequently, in 2015 with the Middle East being overrun by ISIS, Obama is concerned with Iran saving face as long as he can claim that he made a deal. Although rational people cannot comprehend the madness that is emblematic of Obama's dealings with the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran and other enemies of America, it is critical to understand that this is exactly in line with Obama's perspective. He has no problem with the anti-American stance, the antisemitism of the players and the visceral hatred of freedom that mark these groups' ideologies. He appears to be indifferent about the murderous terrorist regime that wishes to spread across the world; he will not acknowledge the bestiality of ISIS because after all sin-filled Christian and Jewish America must continue to wallow in guilt and accept a punishment that is long in coming. Furthermore, from his worldview it is a righteous reaction to imperialistic America, notwithstanding the Islamic jihadist imperialists-on-steroids that bring true destruction and terror. Consequently, the words of veteran Brian Kolfage, fall on deaf ears because Obama sees what he is doing as a success, not as a failure. The third part of Obama's triad of ideological premises is the one that seeks to demoralize America. He has set in motion painful policies like Obamacare that adversely affect far too many Americans. The IRS and Benghazi scandals continue to be hidden. The wrong doers are never punished. Furthermore, sneak that Obama is, the most potent effects will not be felt until after he has completed his term. Thus, when Republicans are in the majority and the full brunt of Obamacare policies hits like a ton of bricks, the mewling press will continue the screed that it is the racist, women-hating Republicans who brought this onto the public. Cause and effect simply do not matter as the nattering fools of the mainstream media. No one will connect the dots back to Teflon-coated Obama and his rather masterful machinations of the past two terms. Natan Sharansky, former political prisoner of the Soviet Union, writes \"the real reason for the U.S. stance [with Iran] is not its assessment, however incorrect, of the two sides’ respective interests but rather a tragic loss of moral self-confidence.\" In the past \"U.S. administrations of all stripes felt certain of the moral superiority of their political system over the Soviet one. They felt they were speaking in the name of their people and the free world as a whole, while the leaders of the Soviet regime could speak for no one but themselves and the declining number of true believers still loyal to their ideology.\" Obama does not believe in the \"superiority of liberal democracy.\" His core belief is to degrade America and American law in every way possible Thus, there has been no surrender on the part of Obama because what is happening is what he always wanted to have happen.

        "articles": "After studying public opinion for many years, I think I have a fairly good understanding of what shapes the typical American’s political views. There is, however, one topic that has me flummoxed: why so many Americans still hold rosy opinions about Barack Obama as the president and as a person. Pollingreport.com posted the latest polls by about a dozen organizations plumbing Americans’ recent opinions about Obama’s job performance. Most major poll results showed approval of his job performance averaged 45-46%. Disapproval averaged two or three percentage points higher. A CNN/ORC poll conducted June 26-28, however, showed his job approval at 50% while 47% disapproved. The Gallup poll’s daily tracking report for July 14, 2015 showed Obama’s job performance rating at 46% approval vs. 49% disapproval. (Approval of Obama’s job performance will probably increase following the deal with Iran.) The same organizations’ recent polls showed positive perceptions of Obama as a person frequently exceed 50%. (His reputation for honesty dipped when it was revealed that he lied to sell Obamacare, but has since recovered.) What’s difficult to understand about this is that when the same organizations plumb opinions about topics -- such as the country’s direction, perceptions of economic conditions, views of U.S. influence abroad, etc. -- that correlate robustly with presidential job approval, the results are usually abysmal, and ought negatively to affect dispositions about Obama. (When George W. Bush was president, for example, abysmal opinions on these issues drove his job approval ratings into the gutter.) This essay attempts to comprehend why, despite his policy failures at home and abroad, scandals, and lies, many Americans continue to approve of Obama’s job performance and regard him favorably as a person. At least five major factors seem to play a part: (1) Americans’ views of the presidency; (2) Obama’s racial make-up; (3) his party affiliation; (4) the mainstream media’s (MSM’s) bias on his behalf; and (5) Americans’ tendency to accord very low priority to politics. No one can fully appreciate opinions about Obama unless he/she understands Americans’ perceptions of the presidential office. Given the topic’s importance, it is not surprising that a large body of research (by scholars, journalists, politicians, and lay-persons) exists detailing the public’s views of the presidency. One could easily get lost in the minutiae these studies have produced. An excellent assessment of public opinion about the presidency can be found in a slim volume by the late Thomas Langston, With Reverence and Contempt (1997). Looking at public perceptions of the presidency from George Washington to Bill Clinton, Langston argued that the public conceptualizes every president as a democratic priest-king. As a priest, the president is supposed to “make meaningful the lives of the people.” As king, the president is expected to exercise power for “the public good.” As a democratic office, the president is supposed to represent all the people, be one of the people. Langston’s review of Americans’ perceptions of presidents suggests that a combination of “unrealistic expectations, false hopes, and willful misunderstandings” produces a “dysfunctional relationship” between ordinary Americans and their Chief Executive. The implication of Langston’s book is that most people expect more of their president than he -- so far -- can accomplish, but they continue to hold him -- so far -- in high regard, and adamantly refuse to acknowledge that he -- so far -- can dislike the nation. (On this, Rush Limbaugh is absolutely right.) This complex relationship between the American people and the president has the potential to induce negative feelings about the Chief Executive. But, usually it doesn’t. Why? As Langston wrote, “[t]he American public is excessively passive before its presidents.” Most people are predisposed, in short, to give a president the benefit of the doubt. That is one reason Obama’s public image tends to somewhat inflated. Race is likely another factor keeping views of Obama more positive than they might otherwise be. As the first African American to be elected and re-elected president, Obama has enjoyed overwhelming backing from blacks. As the Gallup Poll’s president Frank Newport reported last October, blacks’ approval of Obama’s job performance has averaged 40 percentage points higher than the rest of the public throughout his presidency. The late October 2014 Gallup poll, for example, found more than 85% of blacks approved of Obama’s job, compared with 41% of the public as a whole. (A more recent poll would also probably show a sizable racial gap in opinions about Obama’s job performance.) Blacks comprise roughly 13% of America’s population. Nevertheless, their overwhelming approval of Obama very likely keeps poll data on his job performance and personality higher than they otherwise would be. Partisanship also influences views of Obama. As Jeffrey Jones reports, Gallup’s latest poll shows that in the second quarter of 2015, Democrats have regained an edge over the GOP among the American public (46% vs. 41%). Partisanship plays an important role in views of a president’s job performance. Republicans are typically a great deal more likely than Democrats to say they approve of a Republican president’s job performance, and vice versa when the POTUS is a Democrat. Gallup polls tapping opinions about Obama’s job performance, for example, typically reveal that approximately 80% of Democrats say they approve of his job as president, compared with roughly 46% of Independents, and about 17% of Republicans. Recall Jones’ report that Democrats now slightly out-number Republicans in the public. All other things being equal, the more people who think of themselves as Democrats, the higher will be Obama’s approval ratings. Partisanship and race probably influence the MSM’s “slobbering love affair” with Obama. MSM denizens are overwhelmingly left-wing Democrats, which this site’s readers know very well. Left-wing Democrats in the MSM likely accept the belief that racism motivates any criticism of Obama. Since they are loath to express any sentiment that could be so construed, they sing his praises and refuse to report anything that could be considered critical of him. (Expect the MSM to laud Obama’s deal with Iran.) Given the MSM’s infatuation with Obama and the fact that many Americans still rely on the MSM for the news, is there any wonder that polls show public approval of his job performance, and especially that perceptions of him as a person, remain higher than they might otherwise be? Other facets of public opinion probably keep Obama’s poll ratings higher than a large corpus of public opinion research would suggest. First, most of the time, most Americans don’t care very much about or pay much attention to public affairs. Personal matters -- such as family, work, play, entertainment, health, etc. -- are far more important to the average person than is politics. Second, since Americans aren’t very interested in politics, they don’t know much about public affairs. Political indifference and ignorance, coupled with Americans’ refusal to believe their country’s Chief Executive harbors ill will toward the nation -- which has already been noted -- seem to enhance many people’s responses when queried about a president’s job performance and personality. The factors detailed above help me comprehend an otherwise vexing phenomenon. The American Thinker’s readers undoubtedly will mention other factors shaping perceptions of Obama. I remain open to suggestions. After studying public opinion for many years, I think I have a fairly good understanding of what shapes the typical American’s political views.

        "articles": "We all know that Barack Obama was nominally a lawyer at some point in his past – not a good one, by anyone's account, but he was one. Assume for the moment that Barack Obama had as his client The Muslim Brotherhood, or CAIR, or Hamas, or any one of dozens of organizations dedicated to taking down the United States. Could he possibly have done a more effective job of hiding his client's actions or intentions while they went about conducting criminal operations unmolested as he has for seven years? Could he have been more successful at misdirecting and obfuscating and lying about their intentions and deeds than he has already been? Though not every lawyer shares a client's philosophy, the zeal with which an attorney does his job can sometimes be proportionate to his identity with the client's goals and objectives. The president certainly is a zealous fellow when it comes to radical Islam. We know he won't call it \"radical Islam,\" claiming that that is a distraction or a talking point. Perhaps the real reason is that he doesn't believe that what the Islamists he supports are doing is radical at all. Maybe the actual issue is that he believes in and supports their efforts to infiltrate and subvert the United States. That would explain an awful lot, wouldn't it? For seven years, we have heard how the president \"doesn't get it\" and is in over his head, is naive, and countless other excuses. None of this has ever been the problem. He gets it. He simply gets it with regard to his own agenda, his own end game. It's the American people who continue not to get it. The president is in bed with the enemy. It is ironic that so many of those who are angry that the president won't say \"radical Islam\" themselves won't openly say that he is and always has been the patron of radical Islamists, and he protects them for that reason. Until we admit this, and see him for what he is and what he has been doing consistently and with determination, we enable him to succeed. The president points to his limited efforts to eradicate certain violent Muslims through drone strikes and minimal military operations, as if this proves he is \"one of us\" and is working to protect the United States. Muslims attack other Muslims all the time, but they are all still Muslims. If the president chooses to assist certain factions he favors against certain others, this is hardly being done to protect the United States. If that were his objective, he wouldn't be freeing a significant number of homicidal Muslims as well, who are back on the job killing Americans. He is barely lifting a finger militarily or internationally, regardless of what he says. However, he is moving heaven and earth domestically, where the actual invasion and conquest is actively going on. People who recognize that we have seen increasing levels of terroristic violence across the country committed in the name of Islam by its perpetrators want the president to name the threat for the simple reason that his failure to do so, when viewed with all the other things he has done to protect and promote Islamists to weaken our military, our national government, and our security, tells them that he is in league with them and that he will not betray them while he repeatedly betrays us. He refuses to identify them because he is their strongest supporter and their most steadfast protector. His unwillingness to admit that there is any Islamic component at all to the terror, even when the terrorists say it happily, tells us that he is willfully misdirecting us from the truth, even when that ensures that more Americans will die. Throughout this week, we have seen news reports of FBI analysts, whose work was to connect the dots, having their files erased of all Muslim suspects who were actively plotting against us. We have heard of how the FBI's hands were tied, and the new rules required that they drop their surveillance of Muslim suspects against whom concrete evidence had not yet been found and how those suspects went on to commit mass murder, including this week in Orlando. We have heard how employers and neighbors of Muslims who engaged in terrorism here were afraid of saying anything against the terrorists because they were Muslim, including both Orlando and San Bernardino. Our government has vowed to punish those who express legitimate fears about Muslims behaving suspiciously, which the government deems Islamophobia rather than domestic or national security. That is, our government has vowed to punish Americans who have the audacity to object to their own destruction. How would any of this be different if we had an openly Muslim president and a pro-Muslim, pro-sharia government? None of this is new, and it continues to be the policy of this administration right up to the last couple of days, when the Department of Homeland Security has come out with new prohibitions on words that might offend those who most want to destroy this country. Words like \"jihad\" and \"sharia\" are banned by government fascists who control speech and thought. There was a simultaneous story this week about a 25-year-old Syrian immigrant, Laila Alawa, who is one of 15 members of the Homeland Security Advisory Council Subcommittee on Countering Violent Extremism and who is rabidly anti-American and an anti-white racist. She seems fine with Islamic violent extremism, declaring that 9/11 changed the world for good. It is the committee on which she serves that advocated censoring those words that might offend Muslims. Those who work within this administration to harm the United States in the name of Islam have been serving at the president's pleasure, or with his blessing. If that were not true, he would purge the government of all such anti-American and pro-Islamist enemies of the country. He doesn't. Their numbers grow steadily. This is his administration. These are his surrogates. They are the vehicle by which his policies, his goals, and his beliefs are being put into effect. He is one of them. There is no other explanation for them populating our government at every level, but particularly the highest ones. Those who most vehemently represent the president's views are rewarded with the opportunity to destroy this country from within, along with complete immunity from punishment or retribution for expressing their desire to do just that. Naturally, an armed citizenry is a substantial obstacle to our overthrow. It is for this president and his party members a rather happy coincidence, therefore, that we have just experienced both an Islamic victory on our soil, about which the president has vowed to do absolutely nothing, and the use of a gun, about which the president has vowed to do everything in his power. It is at times like this that his priorities and goals converge and are laid open to be seen unmistakably. Americans must pay the price for what was done to them. It is our rights, but not those of the invaders and traitors, that must be slashed. It's time we admit the obvious. Radical Islam isn't radical to this president. It's simply a means to an end. Our end. We all know that Barack Obama was nominally a lawyer at some point in his past – not a good one, by anyone's account, but he was one.

        "articles": "There are some very interesting implications of the way progressive Democrats handle the shooting incidents and the way they handle other aspects of human behavior. Progressive Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders rebel against the idea that the only way for citizens to protect themselves from gun violence is to carry guns themselves. Of course, they, like the liberal Hollywood movie stars who speak out against gun violence, are complete hypocrites. They want one set of rules for themselves and another set for everyone else. The obvious proof of this is that these people, such as Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Barbara Boxer and all other well known anti-gun Progressives insist that carrying guns is not a solution, yet they themselves would not step out of their cars or homes without a bodyguard standing close by toting a loaded handgun. And Hollywood movie stars who occasionally jump on the anti-gun ownership bandwagon have made millions in films that glorify gun violence. That’s the obvious hypocrisy. But there exists a political hypocrisy at a deeper level. This hypocrisy is expanded when they insist that ordinary citizens jump through all sorts of legal obstacles in order to legally carry a gun, while they know full well that criminals can easily carry guns and in addition, that in the most violence cities like Chicago those who commit crimes with guns are not prosecuted to the full extent of the law. They only want the full extent of the law to be applied to legal gun ownership. What’s interesting is that after the gun murders committed at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, Hillary Clinton claimed that it’s offensive to state the position that people need guns to protect themselves from guns. It comes down to this: Progressive Democrats refuse to accept as a fact, that there are people out in public places who will, for whatever reason, unexpectedly kill other people. For some reason it’s always the gun’s fault that the murders were committed. The fact is, for every four murders committed with a handgun one person is murdered with a knife, yet Hillary Clinton has never ranted against knife ownership or said we need more knife control. Neither has any other political candidate, mayor, or public official who call themselves a progressive concerned with protecting the innocent. The refusal to acknowledge the fact that it is an unfortunate fact of human nature that some people will always choose to kill others, by whatever means available, is what drives the denial of murder. This tendency of people to kill each other is repeatedly denied, yet progressives are never reluctant to affirm that human nature will always lead people to discriminate against people of color, that corporate executives will always be greedy, that Wall St. hedge fund managers will cheat the tax system as much as possible, and so on. That some people refuse to heed the better angels of their nature only applies to gun ownership. And as a side note there is irrefutable evidence that banning guns not only does not prevent gun murders but the opposite is true; that banning handguns promotes handgun murder. When Chicago banned handgun ownership for 25 years the murder rate increased by 44%. This is based on information from the FBI and the Chicago Police, who are in a better position to know the facts than some progressive who wants to run for President -- while having armed bodyguards. Hillary Clinton and her ilk only accept bad behavior when it’s to their political advantage. They refuse to accept that violent people can only be stopped with guns, yet they have passed hundreds of community-based programs to fight against poverty, joblessness, and the lack of available birth control. They have no trouble or hesitation assuming that people do bad things with regard to racial profiling, bullying, or the use of politically incorrect language; yet with regard to shooting innocent people they are in denial that they only way for decent citizens to protect themselves is to own a gun. They do not propose community based programs for security guards and employees in schools carry guns as a solution. Another issue is that by focusing on gun control they make the silly impression that the people who commit mass murders were not violating any other laws. The person who shot the victims in Oregon committed dozens of other crimes, and the fact that these other crimes, such as discharge of a weapon in a public no-gun zone, bringing a loaded weapon into a no-gun zone, assault with a deadly weapon, intent to kill, and murder are already serious crimes doesn’t matter. It’s not the major issue. Only the fact that the murders were done with a gun is the issue. Progressive Democrats know for a fact that more gun laws will not stop somebody from murdering people in public. Proof of this is the fact that they always have bodyguards. And they know that more gun laws won’t stop it either, since the murderers commit dozens of crimes and none of those laws deterred them. It’s only brought up as a campaign issue, to show that they are all for the innocent victims, when in reality if this college had had a number of armed teachers, maintenance employees, and so on, fewer people may have been killed. But critical thinking is not something Progressive Democrats want to teach their potential voters. They intentionally choose to pursue issues that have no clear cut answer. This enables them to gain the sympathetic support of voters --- whom the Democrats hope will look past their armed bodyguards --- and make some political hay out of it. The reason Progressive Democrats will not accept the fact that armed guards at schools will help is that they want this to be a campaign issue. After all, Hillary Clinton certainly can’t run on the idea that as Secretary of State she helped broker peace in the Middle East, or that the Obama administration improved the economy, balanced the budget, and lowered taxes for the middle class and poor, and reduced gun violence in black neighborhoods. These have all gotten worse under Hillary and Obama. What should be more offensive to voters is the fact that Democrats control cities where the black ghettoes are found, and that these innocents are murdered every day. But since these areas are under their complete control they don’t want to appear to be responsible. They only want to spin the issue so that the Republicans are NRA look responsible. The facts are always against them, so they need to spin the situation to run from the facts and turn their voters against Republicans.

        "articles": "For Democrats, Joe Biden is the top seed in the race to unseat President Trump in 2020. He's come a long way from his nutty-uncle gaffe-a-thon persona, and with a slew of medals and honors from President Obama, he presents the very picture of the respectable modern statesman. He showed up at a lot of foreign funerals for heads of state. He milked the sympathy factor over his son's death from cancer. He wore a suit. He projected gravitas. Yet he also manages to have a hard-hat appeal and a mainstream-Democratic-ideological image, which seems to be the right formula for Democrats winning in most of their races these days. No surprise, he's the Democratic frontrunner in polls among Democrats with a seven-point lead, campaigning even now with fire to burn, because he's convinced he made a mistake in not running back in 2016. Except there's some dirty laundry now that's getting some airing. Biden, it turns out, is loaded with dirty deals spread out the \"legal\" way, among his family members, which has made his tribe immensely rich. What's more, he's doing it the swamp way, which keeps the long arm of the law out of the picture, based on deftly navigating the political loopholes, and a sharkily deft capacity to use advantages. According to the indefatigable investigative reporter Peter Schweizer, who's written a book about this: \"One of the best ways to make friends in Washington is to do deals with family members,\" he continued. \"Joe Biden every year as vice president, he has to disclose his income, assuming those disclosures are honest. He can't have a big, fat check from the Chinese government in that disclosure form, but his adult son, Hunter Biden, he doesn't have to disclose anything.\" Schweizer reported a lot of this stuff back in March when his book about swamp corruption came out. He has since unearthed ugly new self-dealing from the Democratic frontrunner. According to PJ Media, quoting from Schweizer, who told Fox News: A bank account that Hunter Biden drew a lot of money from and that a lot of foreign entities put a lot of money into,\" the author noted. \"Just to give you an idea, over a 14-month period, from 2014 through early 2016, while Joe Biden is vice president of the United States, a Ukrainian company called Burisma – it's controlled by a very corrupt oligarch – sends three million dollars into this account. A Chinese government entity called Bohai Harvest – which is run by the Bank of China – sends $650,000 into this account,\" Schweizer added. \"There's $1.2 million that comes from an LLC with a small boutique Swiss bank. We don't know who's behind the LLC. The bank itself has been charged in six countries for money laundering, so that makes it kind of sketchy. This all stands out, and it shows how dirty and underhanded the Biden-led swamp's power games are. Not only is the swamp-left determined to unseat President Trump, but it seems to be obsessed with self-dealing, and in ways that are unavailable to ordinary Americans. Joe Biden can keep going as he presents himself as the candidate of the little guy, but these billion-dollar political-connection deals tell a different story. It's unknown how well the Trump campaign can fight back against them, given that the left has flung similar charges of self-dealing. But if Joe means to run as the anti-Trump, the exposure of his financial dealings is not going to help him. And without a Mister Clean image, what does he have? Higher taxes? Economic stagnation? His platform is a failure in comparison to Trump's. Spread the news of this swampy self-dealing far and wide, because Biden's laundry is stinky, indeed.

        "articles": "We're living in some bizarre times. White people must be constantly on guard in their use of language whenever a minority is within earshot – not because whites are racist, even though some are, but because any utterance passing their lips can be parsed to create an inference that was never intended. As a result, a form of speech repression has taken place, turning innocuous conversations into unwarranted guilt trips. Contrary to what's being pushed by extremist groups, the overwhelming numbers of whites are decent, fair-minded, and devoid of racial prejudice. In fact, I've often seen whites go out of their way to be extra-accommodating toward non-whites. Undoubtedly, that's because they want to assure them that racism has been properly disposed of in the dustbin of history. Yet there are some race-hustlers who try to keep the corrosive image of white supremacy alive in order to further their own political ambitions. After all, if racial conflict ends, how are those hustlers going to get funded by all those self-hating liberals? The constant accusation of bigotry is a pervasive problem in today's culture because it makes for a false narrative regarding races, genders, nationalities, religions, etc. and uses it as leverage to promote the inaccurate notion of unfairness or discrimination. The consequences may provide a loser's limp for minorities. If a minority student is receiving low marks in school, the student or the parent can blame it on bigotry in the education system. The failing white student has no such crutch to limp along on. How about the minority who is less than productive in the work environment? Suppose the employer feels intimidated about terminating the worker because of the worker's color, sex, or sexual orientation. To the minority employee, that may seem like job security, but, in reality it may be the best reason for employers to hesitate when deciding to hire a minority. If a typical white man shows a propensity for substandard work or takes sick days too frequently, his employer can hand him a pink slip (assuming he's not in some politically-protected classification) without compunction. The fired worker won't have that crutch, so there'll be no to reprisals, legal or otherwise. Make no mistake about it: accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and all the rest have become powerful weapons of mass hysteria, with the capacity to destroy the most militarily superior and bountifully prosperous country in recorded time. For example, the aggressive invasion from south of the border could one day be written as the first time in the history of the planet that a mighty nation was conquered not by gun or sword, but by a morbid fear of being characterized as intolerant by the aggressors. U.S. citizens have been warned against using the term \"illegal alien\" because it's now considered a form of bigotry. Instead, we're told that the proper term is \"undocumented immigrant.\" Using that logic, a burglar who's exiting your home with your TV on his shoulder should be called an undocumented shopper. Hostile illegal aliens have no intention of \"melting\" into the \"pot\" that gave us a unified language and unified laws and customs. Instead, they demand that their own cultures be etched into the landscape. While they stomp on and burn our American flag, they proudly fly their own flags, as if they were marching to victory over a defeated enemy. If that's not a definition of invasion, I don't know what is. What I do know is that our country is becoming Balkanized in ways that haven't been seen since just prior to the Civil War. When we finally elected a president who stands up to the false and dangerous rhetoric of the invaders and takes steps to defend our country, a new paradigm emerged. The left wing has taken steps to undermine the clearly expressed sentiment of the voters. President Trump is called racist for trying to preserve the sovereignty of our nation by stopping the illegal mass migration from the south. Democrats, realizing they've lost the votes of patriots across the country, have turned their backs on citizens and embraced the invaders, hoping to give them amnesty and the right to vote – for Democrats, of course. All of the foregoing makes our country feel less safe, which impels mass numbers of people to arm themselves in preparation for the violent civil unrest that seems imminent. Meanwhile, in their typically bizarre method of reasoning, some Democrats are calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment. Hence, if the drug-crazed mugger is coming toward you with an illegal gun, you'd better not be able to defend yourself with a legal one. In the mind of a liberal, one should reason with the mugger and beg forgiveness for the social and economic conditions that caused him to embark on a life of crime. In the mind of a conservative, the mugger is a dangerous thug who should have lethal force used against him. His skin color will not be a factor in the decision. We're living in some bizarre times.

Anyone who denies that is living in fantasyland. Hence the question is no longer “Is Trump the sort of man we want to be president?” but instead the question is “Who worse for the country; Hillary or Trump?” A key related question is, can the country survive a Hillary presidency? If it’s possible, or likely, that she will effect such significant changes that no future conservative can ever hope to win the presidency, then those #NeverTrump folks who are saying that Trump will destroy the conservative brand are doing the equivalent of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. We know that Hillary has no respect for the law or the Constitution; she’s essentially a fascist, and that her Supreme Court judges will be hardcore left-wing activists like the “Notorious RBG”. Given that we can’t count on a Republican Congress to stop her, a rational observer would have to conclude that by the end of Hillary’s first term that either illegals will have been given the vote or that a corrupt DOJ would look the other way when illegals illegally vote. Similarly a Hillary-packed Court would move to eviscerate the First Amendment not only for people of faith but to ensure that only liberal organizations could spend money on political campaigns. The latter would eliminate the only tool conservatives have to attempt to balance a media that is nearly totally in the tank for Hillary and her ilk. Between the huge influx of voters who would vote for more welfare for themselves and conservative’s inability to get their message out, an unending succession of liberal politicians is inevitable. Even if we assume that by some miracle four years of Hillary doesn’t destroy Democracy in America, there is a strong case for preferring Trump. Hillary used a technicality to ensure that a man who raped a 12-year-old girl got two months in prison; Trump treats women better than that.

Senator Chuck Schumer bizarrely linked vote fraud to Charlottesville. In the wake of the confrontation in Charlottesville, Senate Minority Leader Charles E.

In a Medium post, Schumer said the actions of the commission were \"wolves in sheep's clothing\" and a \"ruse\" designed to \"revive the old playbook and disenfranchise minority voters.\" They really, really don't want anyone looking closely at vote fraud. They claim there is none of any significance. That must be why this report from Chicago City Wire has been so thoroughly ignored by the mainstream media: More than 14,000 votes were cast in Chicago during the 2016 general election than there were voters to cast them, based on separate figures released by the Chicago Board of Elections, the chairman of the Chicago Republican Party has reported. Chris Cleveland told the Chicago Wire that \"on a whim,\" he filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the board, which provided him with a list of 1,101,178 people who voted in the general election. An earlier post on the board's website said that 1,115,664 votes had been cast. \"There should be never be more votes than voters,\" Cleveland said. \"Every ballot cast should be recorded against a registered voter.\" The party did a breakdown of voting by precinct, and Cleveland said it found an uneven distribution of discrepancies.

In April, the group sent a notice-of-violation letter along with a threat to sue the 11 states. Robert Popper, director of Judicial Watch's Election Integrity Project and formerly deputy chief of the voting section of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, said that not maintaining accurate voting rolls violates the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. \"People remember the act as the 'motor voter' law because it requires the states to offer voter registration forms with driver license applications,\" Popper said. \"But what a lot of people forget is that as a compromise for getting the act through, it requires states to maintain accurate voting rolls.\" Judicial Watch identified 26 Illinois counties where voter registration was higher than the number of people eligible to vote, according to Census numbers.

Last week, fake news media and the Democrats flooded the airwaves with their narrative that Trump cruelly “mocked” Christine Blasey Ford. Upon listening to what Trump actually said, I thought, “For crying out loud. All Trump did was expose the unreported facts of the case. And this is called mocking?” The truth of the matter is, the left's greatest weapon is its ability to dominate the airwaves with deceptions and lies which produce misinformed voters and Republican politicians fearful of telling the truth.I knew that Trump humorously explaining the absurdity of Ford's claim was a home run. First, he informed the public of the facts and second, he outraged the left, which told me Trump's explanation was effective.Leftists have laid down the rules of political battle which most Republicans and GOP advisers sheepishly obey. Leftists' rules says they are allowed to use any immoral gutter tactic they can conceive to defeat conservatives and Republicans. Meanwhile, any attempt by conservatives/Republicans to defend themselves is branded racist, sexist, homophobic, and an expression of white privilege. Against the advice of many, Trump broke the left’s rule by simply sharing the facts of the case with the American people. Brilliant! Remember, anti-Christian and anti-American leftist zealots are all about keeping the masses ignorant and deceived. Leftists' heads exploded because Trump dared to tell the people the truth.I wept during Kavanaugh's heartfelt and painful opening statement at his hearing. What the left was attempting to do to this good and decent man was an anathema to my sense of righteousness, decency, and justice. I knew many Americans shared my feelings which is why I knew Kavanaugh's speech was a home run. In essence, Kavanaugh simply informed the public of the facts; the truth. This shattered the left’s demonic scheme to destroy Kavanaugh based solely on Ford's emotional but evidence-free testimony. The entire American left immediately launched a campaign to mock and discredit Kavanaugh's powerful rebuttal. This told me that the left knew that Kavanaugh passionate defense was resonating with the American people.Like I said, leftists hate it when Republicans simply tell the public the truth. The left’s (Democrats, fake news media, and Hollywood) entire game plan is rooted in lies, deception and misinforming the public – making emotions overrule facts and evidence.To give you an insight into the leftist propaganda machine we are up against, over 600 lawyers and law professors wrote that Kavanaugh's opening statement should disqualify him from the Supreme Court. Six hundred legal experts ignored Kavanaugh's peerless, outstanding career. Ponder that, folks. Depraved activists on the left attempted to brand this honorable husband and father of two daughters a serial rapist. These same evil activists are saying Kavanaugh should not have expressed his anger or hurt over their over-the-top outlandish attempt to smear him. Late cosmetic queen Mary Kay Ash said, “The speed of the leader is the speed of the gang.” In other words, as our nation's leader, Trump's strong leadership is trickling down. More Republicans are finally boldly informing the public of crucial facts; senators Chuck Grassley, Mitch McConnell, and Lindsey Graham, to name a few. I believe this is a new trend for Conservatives/Republicans.Many in the all-black congregation of the Baltimore church attended by my brother parroted leftists' lie that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking and assaulted Ford. My brother said he simply informed them of the facts; Ford's lack of evidence and Kavanuagh proving her accusation untrue. My brother asked his church members to imagine such unsubstantiated allegations launched against their fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons. My brother said suddenly, the group of Kavanaugh haters became silent. This proves my case that the left uses emotion, lies, and deception to fool the masses. This is why it is vital that our side become more outspoken about telling the truth about issues.I am elated and extremely grateful that both President Trump and Brett Kavanaugh had the courage to hang in there. Given the GOP's history of surrendering to negative media, dirty tricks, and screaming activists, Democrats and fake news media expected Trump to withdraw his nomination or for Kavanaugh to slink away in disgrace and fear. Thank God both men stood strong.In response to Kavanaugh's confirmation, fake news media is saying millions of women are outraged and the GOP will pay a huge price at the polls in November. The truth is the polar opposite. Americans are thrilled over Kavanaugh becoming the fifth conservative on the Supreme Court.The major task at hand is to get everyone to the polls who wants Trump's unique mission of putting America first to continue.My wife Mary and I just returned home to West Virginia from campaigning with the Conservative Campaign Committee in Texas for Ted Cruz. For several months, I've been building a screened-in room. It relaxes me. This week, we are flying back out to campaign for various Republican/Conservative candidates around the country. This is serious business, folks. We must keep the GOP in control of the house and Senate for Trump to continue making America great again.Lloyd Marcus, The Unhyphenated AmericanHelp Lloyd spread the  Brett Kavanaugh is now a justice on the Supreme Court -- a tremendous victory for President Trump and America.

This shattered the left’s demonic scheme to destroy Kavanaugh based solely on Ford's emotional but evidence-free testimony. The entire American left immediately launched a campaign to mock and discredit Kavanaugh's powerful rebuttal. This told me that the left knew that Kavanaugh passionate defense was resonating with the American people. Like I said, leftists hate it when Republicans simply tell the public the truth. The left’s (Democrats, fake news media, and Hollywood) entire game plan is rooted in lies, deception and misinforming the public – making emotions overrule facts and evidence. To give you an insight into the leftist propaganda machine we are up against, over 600 lawyers and law professors wrote that Kavanaugh's opening statement should disqualify him from the Supreme Court. Six hundred legal experts ignored Kavanaugh's peerless, outstanding career. Ponder that, folks. Depraved activists on the left attempted to brand this honorable husband and father of two daughters a serial rapist. These same evil activists are saying Kavanaugh should not have expressed his anger or hurt over their over-the-top outlandish attempt to smear him. Late cosmetic queen Mary Kay Ash said, “The speed of the leader is the speed of the gang.” In other words, as our nation's leader, Trump's strong leadership is trickling down. More Republicans are finally boldly informing the public of crucial facts; senators Chuck Grassley, Mitch McConnell, and Lindsey Graham, to name a few. I believe this is a new trend for Conservatives/Republicans. Many in the all-black congregation of the Baltimore church attended by my brother parroted leftists' lie that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking and assaulted Ford. My brother said he simply informed them of the facts; Ford's lack of evidence and Kavanuagh proving her accusation untrue. My brother asked his church members to imagine such unsubstantiated allegations launched against their fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons. My brother said suddenly, the group of Kavanaugh haters became silent. This proves my case that the left uses emotion, lies, and deception to fool the masses. This is why it is vital that our side become more outspoken about telling the truth about issues. I am elated and extremely grateful that both President Trump and Brett Kavanaugh had the courage to hang in there. Given the GOP's history of surrendering to negative media, dirty tricks, and screaming activists, Democrats and fake news media expected Trump to withdraw his nomination or for Kavanaugh to slink away in disgrace and fear. Thank God both men stood strong. In response to Kavanaugh's confirmation, fake news media is saying millions of women are outraged and the GOP will pay a huge price at the polls in November. The truth is the polar opposite. Americans are thrilled over Kavanaugh becoming the fifth conservative on the Supreme Court. The major task at hand is to get everyone to the polls who wants Trump's unique mission of putting America first to continue. My wife Mary and I just returned home to West Virginia from campaigning with the Conservative Campaign Committee in Texas for Ted Cruz. For several months, I've been building a screened-in room. It relaxes me. This week, we are flying back out to campaign for various Republican/Conservative candidates around the country. This is serious business, folks. We must keep the GOP in control of the house and Senate for Trump to continue making America great again. Lloyd Marcus, The Unhyphenated American Help Lloyd spread the Truth ",

Specifically, why so many Americans - 61% according to a Fox News poll - think that the president lies \"most of the time\" and \"some of the time.\" It comes as no surprise today that Obama's defenders are sparing no invective for Fox News in the wake of that survey. But it was the president, not Fox News, who repeatedly and knowingly misled the American people with two infamous Obamacare lies: “You can keep your health insurance if you like it. Period. You can keep your doctor. Period.” For better or worse, Obama will forever be known as the president who chose repeatedly to propagate two falsehoods. Those two lies were profoundly significant because they were designed to hide the truth about how Obamacare would affect the daily lives and health of hundreds of millions of Americans. Since it became painfully clear in 2013 that Obama had lied about Obamacare since 2009, it has been increasingly difficult for many Americans to continue accepting at face value his statements on other major public issues. In both the Benghazi and IRS scandals, for example, Obama claimed to have known nothing about them until they were reported in the national media. But if that were true, why has the president's attorney general and so many other of his most prominent appointees withheld thousands of documents subpoenaed by Congress and requested by journalists under the Freedom of Information Act? Are there passages in those withheld documents that make it clear Obama knew much more than he has admitted? Such questions go to the heart of the issue of the president's probity. If he lied about keeping health insurance plans and doctors, why should fellow citizens believe his claim that nothing else could have been done to save four Americans in Benghazi, or that there isn't \"a smidgen of corruption\" at the IRS? That is Obama's legacy and his burden. All presidents lie to some extent - except the difference between other chief executives and Obama is, for example, when a president claims a law he wants passed is \"for the children,\" most of us roll our eyes and know what he's really saying - some interest group wants this legislation and I need their votes. This is a lie of omission and most of us are fully aware of the truth. But when Obama looked the American people in the eye and claimed you could keep your insurance and your doctor under Obamacare, this was a subterfuge told because the truth would have scuttled the bill. We had no reason to doubt the president when he made those statements, although many Republicans pointed out the discepancy between what was in the bill and the president's words. It was a lie told to deliberately decieve - a conscious effort to hide the truth until after the bill was passed. It doesn't get any worse than that for a president.

From Space Daily: \"The report cautions that the nation's earth observing system is beginning a rapid decline in capability, as long-running missions end and key new missions are delayed, lost, or cancelled. \"The projected loss of observing capability will have profound consequences on science and society, from weather forecasting to responding to natural hazards,\" said Dennis Hartmann, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, and chair of the committee that wrote the report. \"Our ability to measure and understand changes in Earth's climate and life support systems will also degrade.\" Why are our capabilities degrading? According to the article: \"The new report finds that although NASA responded favorably and aggressively to the decadal survey, the required budget was not achieved, greatly slowing progress. Changes in program scope without commensurate funding, directed by the Office of Management and Budget and by Congress, also slowed progress. A further impediment, the report says, is the absence of a highly reliable and affordable medium-class launch capability.\" Soooo, The Obama Administration is starving NASA and the other agencies involved in launching and maintaining satellites as well as operating, collating data, and whatnot. We knew this to be the case; President Obama has directed NASA to change its overall mission from exploration to encouraging Islamic self-esteem. He has slashed NASA's budget for planetary research from 1.5 to 1.2 billion. He has cancelled the space shuttle, the planned lunar spacecraft called Orion, as well as plans cuts to funding for Mars studies. Now, were this part of an austerity program that saw across-the-board cuts Mr. Obama could be excused, but this is not part of a general austerity program, and the Administration continues to spend money at a rate that would make some very intoxicated sailors in port blush. Yet he cuts NASA, and especially cuts funding to Earth studies. Why? While the purveyors of Anthropogenic Global Warming become more vocal, declaring the debate over, they do so as the data becomes more scant. There has been a huge reduction in the number of surface-based temperature stations worldwide in recent years. The loss of actual surface measurements is made up through statistical norming, where we assume a certain temperature from readings at other stations (in other words, a guess) and by greater use of satellite data. Unfortunately for the Warmists, data hasn't been friendly to their cause, and that must be remedied. How do you remedy such a situation? You cut back on hard data; the models you employ then are used to extrapolate what you think is happening. Cutting satellite funding empowers the model makers and the \"experts\" who study and extrapolate the decreasing amount of data. In short, it makes guesswork more important -- which means we can claim the planet is warming without any real data. It's a magic trick. It's a climatological three card Monty game. With less data that can actually be challenged you make it harder to dispute, more fudge factor that can be put out as factual. While we cannot say this is the sole reason for the cuts, it seems a likely one, given the Obama Administration's eager embrace of Global Warming theory, and their strange reticence to spend money on the gathering of evidence to prove that human industrial emissions are causing the planet to warm. Global Warming alarmists build their case on a warming trend that is statistically marginal, and gray data is to their benefit. They are demanding enormous changes to the way we live, to the way we work, travel, to our entire way of life. This can only be accomplished if the public can be convinced it's getting warmer, even if there is no solid evidence to confirm that fact. \"Experts\" anointed by these same people must be the final word, not the data. They have done this before. The ban on DDT, for instance, was based on gray statistics, and it persists despite considerable evidence that DDT saves lives. They did this with nuclear power. They did this with Alar. They are in the process of doing this with BPA, an additive to harden plastics. But they have tried such a monumental power grab before; carbon dioxide is a byproduct of virtually every human activity, including breathing. It requires absolute proof that CO2 emissions are endangering our civilization . That proof just isn't there, but the stakes are too great to admit that; there are huge amounts of money and a power that a Caesar or Pharaoh could only have dreamed about at stake.

        "articles": "Is it just incompetence, or is there something else going on here? Obama's only real competence, it seems, lies in spying on Americans and imposing new restrictions on their liberty. This fact may be the key to understanding this president. He has shown himself sympathetic toward every anti-American dictator on the planet, warmly embracing Hugo ChÃ¡vez, lifting travel restrictions to Castro's Cuba, and (when he thought no one could hear him) promising a cozy second term with President Putin. Obama's love affair with Marxist tyrants has not earned him any favors -- not even the return of one globe-trotting traitor. The best he can do is issue a weak protest and direct his new secretary of state to remark that Hong Kong's and Russia's actions in regard to Snowden are really \"disappointing.\" That kind of swagger should make the Chinese and Russian leadership wet their britches. For his part, Obama has done nothing, perhaps because he is still in thrall of anyone who calls himself a Marxist. The only people he really distrusts are Americans, especially those patriotic Tea Party members who care about their country's future. Does President Obama really hate the American people that much? I think he does. He hates America as it is and as it has been, and, as he openly admits, he wants nothing less than to \"fundamentally transform America.\" One does not completely transform a nation into the opposite of what it is unless one hates that nation as it is. That fact explains why Obama has done so little to protect America while doing so much to spy on, disparage, and attack ordinary Americans. Obama seized on the financial crisis of 2008 as the pretext for passing a sweeping stimulus bill, the Dodd-Frank financial services regulation, and the seriously mislabeled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\" Now, with the help of \"extreme weather\" coverage on every mainstream news service, he has been ginning up another crisis as the pretext for sweeping regulation of the entire economy. And just last week, in a speech at Georgetown University, he has announced what that regulation will cover. It will cover just about everything. Every activity that uses energy, or that used energy in its manufacture or requires energy for its maintenance, will be regulated -- not by Congress but by the president directly. That is the strategy behind Obama's new pronouncements on the \"social cost\" of carbon emissions. As Obama put it in his Georgetown speech, \"the costs of these [climate] events can be measured.\" Nothing could justify the actual cost of Obama's new emissions push, which will raise the cost of electricity along with everything else from cars to refrigerators to new homes. But if the \"social cost\" of carbon emissions is factored in, suddenly the new guidelines are made to seem affordable. But what is the \"social cost\" of carbon? It is the cost of future climate events that \"might result\" from increased carbon emissions. In fact, no one knows whether there actually will be more extreme weather events -- or even what constitutes such an event. Is a cold winter such an event? An abnormally wet spring? An average year, with its share of tornados and wildfires? The truth is that the president is engaging in pure speculation as the basis for policies that will cost hundreds of billions in spending and millions of new jobs. As Obama himself pointed out at Georgetown, America's carbon emissions are \"at the lowest levels in nearly 20 years.\" Yet, according to the president, it is in precisely in this period (\"the last 15 years\") that scientists have recorded rising temperatures. The president's science seems a bit confused. It is all too much like Stalin's fascination with the pseudo-science of Trofim Lysenko. Stalin's faith in Lysenkoism set Soviet agriculture back decades. Yet Lysenko's theories of the heritability of acquired traits became the basis of Soviet agricultural policy -- just as the unproven science of global warming has become the basis of American energy policy under Obama. Lysenkoism ended in disaster for the Soviet Union, and the science of global warming is leading the U.S. and western Europe toward a similar economic disaster. This year, California's Central Valley, which supplies much of America's fresh fruits and vegetables, will receive only 20% of its normal water allocation for fear of harming the Delta smelt. A president with real leadership qualities would suspend the efforts to save the smelt and save the humans instead. But this president is terrified of offending the environmental lobby. In fact, he wants to go farther. Why should farmers have any water at all if the smelt's future is at stake? It's not difficult to see where the pseudo-science of global warming is taking us. Obama has already declared that, in effect, there shall be no new coal-fired power plants and that at least one third of existing coal-fired plants are to be shuttered in the near future, and all of them eventually in the carbon-free future he dreams of. He is preparing regulations that will make it impossible to produce efficient and economical full-size trucks in the numbers now needed to run our economy. His next step will likely be an assault on our nation's ability to produce shale gas through the safe technology of hydraulic fracturing. And that's just the beginning of the total makeover that Obama has in mind for America. Did I mention persecution of journalists? Forced unionization of workplaces? Abortion on demand, funded by every employer? Racial discrimination in perpetuity against non-minorities? And environmental regulations as far as the eye can see, affecting every aspect of life? From the flow per second of your morning shower to the temperature at which you set your thermometer at night, from the car you drive to what you eat, from where and how your children are educated to how you fund your retirement, Obama wants government to control every moment of your existence. Long ago, in a glorious revolution, Americans rejected this sort of tyranny when it was imposed on them by the British Crown. Our only chance now is at the ballot box in 2014 and 2016. Jeffrey Folks is the author of many books on American politics and culture, including Heartland of the Imagination (2013). Is it just incompetence, or is there something else going on here?

That fact explains why Obama has done so little to protect America while doing so much to spy on, disparage, and attack ordinary Americans. Obama seized on the financial crisis of 2008 as the pretext for passing a sweeping stimulus bill, the Dodd-Frank financial services regulation, and the seriously mislabeled \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\" Now, with the help of \"extreme weather\" coverage on every mainstream news service, he has been ginning up another crisis as the pretext for sweeping regulation of the entire economy. And just last week, in a speech at Georgetown University, he has announced what that regulation will cover. It will cover just about everything. Every activity that uses energy, or that used energy in its manufacture or requires energy for its maintenance, will be regulated -- not by Congress but by the president directly. That is the strategy behind Obama's new pronouncements on the \"social cost\" of carbon emissions. As Obama put it in his Georgetown speech, \"the costs of these [climate] events can be measured.\" Nothing could justify the actual cost of Obama's new emissions push, which will raise the cost of electricity along with everything else from cars to refrigerators to new homes. But if the \"social cost\" of carbon emissions is factored in, suddenly the new guidelines are made to seem affordable. But what is the \"social cost\" of carbon? It is the cost of future climate events that \"might result\" from increased carbon emissions. In fact, no one knows whether there actually will be more extreme weather events -- or even what constitutes such an event. Is a cold winter such an event? An abnormally wet spring? An average year, with its share of tornados and wildfires? The truth is that the president is engaging in pure speculation as the basis for policies that will cost hundreds of billions in spending and millions of new jobs. As Obama himself pointed out at Georgetown, America's carbon emissions are \"at the lowest levels in nearly 20 years.\" Yet, according to the president, it is in precisely in this period (\"the last 15 years\") that scientists have recorded rising temperatures. The president's science seems a bit confused. It is all too much like Stalin's fascination with the pseudo-science of Trofim Lysenko. Stalin's faith in Lysenkoism set Soviet agriculture back decades. Yet Lysenko's theories of the heritability of acquired traits became the basis of Soviet agricultural policy -- just as the unproven science of global warming has become the basis of American energy policy under Obama. Lysenkoism ended in disaster for the Soviet Union, and the science of global warming is leading the U.S. and western Europe toward a similar economic disaster. This year, California's Central Valley, which supplies much of America's fresh fruits and vegetables, will receive only 20% of its normal water allocation for fear of harming the Delta smelt. A president with real leadership qualities would suspend the efforts to save the smelt and save the humans instead. But this president is terrified of offending the environmental lobby. In fact, he wants to go farther. Why should farmers have any water at all if the smelt's future is at stake? It's not difficult to see where the pseudo-science of global warming is taking us. Obama has already declared that, in effect, there shall be no new coal-fired power plants and that at least one third of existing coal-fired plants are to be shuttered in the near future, and all of them eventually in the carbon-free future he dreams of. He is preparing regulations that will make it impossible to produce efficient and economical full-size trucks in the numbers now needed to run our economy. His next step will likely be an assault on our nation's ability to produce shale gas through the safe technology of hydraulic fracturing. And that's just the beginning of the total makeover that Obama has in mind for America. Did I mention persecution of journalists? Forced unionization of workplaces? Abortion on demand, funded by every employer? Racial discrimination in perpetuity against non-minorities? And environmental regulations as far as the eye can see, affecting every aspect of life? From the flow per second of your morning shower to the temperature at which you set your thermometer at night, from the car you drive to what you eat, from where and how your children are educated to how you fund your retirement, Obama wants government to control every moment of your existence. Long ago, in a glorious revolution, Americans rejected this sort of tyranny when it was imposed on them by the British Crown. Our only chance now is at the ballot box in 2014 and 2016. Jeffrey Folks is the author of many books on American politics and culture, including Heartland of the Imagination (2013).",

        "articles": "Muslim men rape non-Muslim women (and girls) in disproportionately high numbers in countries with growing Muslim minority populations. Rape of infidel women is part of Islamic law and Islamic tradition. As such, it’s been going on for centuries. This article is about the current threat Muslim rapists pose to non-Muslim women. In order to keep this article to a reasonable length, the focus is on the rape epidemic in Europe, but suffice it to say rape jihad is a gruesome reality the world over. Perhaps there is no European country where rape has reached epidemic proportions as it has in Sweden, a country now known as the “rape capital” of Europe. Sweden ranks Number 2 on the global list of rape countries. From 1975 to present, rape in Sweden has increased 1472%. Based on this model, it is now projected that one in four Swedish women (and sometimes little girls) will be raped. Rape of men and boys is also on the rise. Making this nightmarish situation worse, the authorities hide what’s going on, make outlandish excuses for it, and/or side with the rapists. Dhimmitude has taken hold. Few, if any, will state the truth: that the majority of rapes in Sweden are committed by Muslim males. Of note, a large number of Muslim rapists are under the age of 18 and, if brought to “justice,” receive exceedingly light sentences (even lighter than the absurd non-punishment adults receive) because they are considered juveniles. And so they are released back onto the streets in a flash. To commit more rape. Related to this issue is the fact that many Muslim men in Sweden are classified as “unaccompanied children” when they arrive. The sickness that has taken over Swedish culture is so shocking that in one case where a Somali Muslim was found guilty of raping a dying woman to death (which is horrific enough), the judicial system refused to send him back to Somalia because they determined he would be just as much a risk to women in Somalia as he would be to women in Sweden. And so Swedish women were disregarded out of deference to Somali women. (To learn more about the rape epidemic in Sweden see here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.) But Sweden is not the only European country where rape has become commonplace. Importing Muslims en masse has taken a toll across the continent. With the recent avalanche of young Muslim males sweeping across Europe, violence is rising even further. Including rape. In the United Kingdom rape is occurring on such a massive scale that women no longer feel safe taking a taxi cab. Meanwhile, Muslim child sex trafficking gangs have become so pervasive it is estimated there may be as many as one million victims. One million! It has been referred to as rape on an “industrial scale.” And how has this massive attack against non-Muslim girls in the United Kingdom been addressed by the authorities? They’ve covered up the truth, often blaming the victims. Political leaders, the police, the courts, the media. You name it. They’re overflowing with cowards, leaving children to suffer the unthinkable horrors of kidnapping, torture, and rape. (To learn more about rape, including child sex trafficking operations in the UK, see here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. In Holland, sex trafficking gangs run by Muslim men are also on the rise. In Germany, rape committed by “asylum seekers” is skyrocketing as rape by Muslim men is explained away as “cultural misunderstandings.” So to avoid such “misunderstandings” girls are told to cover up lest they draw attention to themselves and be raped. In Austria, women are feeling the impact of this current avalanche of Muslim invaders, as when a 72-year-old woman was recently raped by a 17-year-old “asylum seeker.” In France, gang rape is on the rise. As with the rest of Europe, if the rapists are brought to trial they barely serve time for their heinous crime. In Spain, the situation is so dire that women don’t leave their house after dark for fear of being raped by Muslim men. In Denmark, more than half of convicted rapists are Muslims. In Norway, there has been a dramatic spike in rapes. In Oslo, 10% of females over the age of 15 have been raped by Muslim men with Muslim men guilty of 100% of the rapes against Norwegian women. Rape in Oslo is now so common that hotels hand out key chain alarms when people check in and increasingly Norwegian women only go out in groups. As is the case throughout the West, anyone who speaks the truth about this is labeled a “racist.” (To learn more about rape jihad across Europe, see here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.) Meanwhile, in the face of this savagery, our political leaders, the media, academics, Muslims, feminists, and/or garden variety lemmings assert that Islam respects women, that it does not sanction the mistreatment of women, and/or that Western culture is a rape culture on par with ISIS. But no matter how persistently or how deeply these fools keep their increasingly vulnerable heads in the sand, it will not change reality. Quite the opposite. By denying the truth, these liars, apologists, and moral relativists fuel violence, rape, torture, enslavement, and death. We must (more than) make up for the damage they inflict. So let us get about the task of educating others to make sure this reality does not take hold in America. Let us do our part to make sure that women and girls in the United States do not wind up victims of rape jihad.

        "articles": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, brimming with big ambitions about being the \"first female president\" and currently the Democratic frontrunner for 2020, has really stepped in it for the coming kickoff in Iowa. Commenting on the totally preventable murder of 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts by an illegal alien who should have been thrown out years ago, the Massachusetts Democrat decided we were all making a big deal out of a nothingburger, so she would put it all in perspective for us: I'm so sorry for the family here and I know this is hard not only for the family but for the people in her community, the people throughout Iowa. But one of the things we have to remember is we need an immigration system that is effective, that focuses on where real problems are. Last month, I went down to the border and I saw where children had been taken away from their mothers. I met with those mothers who had been lied to, who didn't know where their children were, who hadn't had a chance to talk to their children. And there was no plan for how they would be reunified with their children. I think we need immigration laws that focus on people who pose a real threat and I don't think mamas and babies are the place we should be spending our resources. Separating a mama from a baby does not make this country safer. Did she really think we'd all like to change the topic to family separations of illegals caught breaking into the country illegally and their inconveniences while we've got another callous, brutal illegal alien murder of an innocent college student in front of us? Did she really think we wanted more images of crying toddlers, feeling a little rough after just crossing 1,000 miles of Mexican badlands in the tender hands of human smuggling cartels? And American citizen Mollie Tibbetts – err, \"a girl in Iowa\" – is reduced to nothing but a \"sorry, but\"? Note that Warren thinks it's an issue of concern only to Iowa and not the rest of us, though that rather sticks out, given her presidential ambitions. Iowa, see, is just so unimportant and unworthy of comment, unlike the inconveniences of illegals crossing illegally. Considering its leading role in the 2020 election, which makes Warren's remarks a little mind-boggling for their political stupidity, Iowa can do a lot of things to your dreams, Liz. Every politician out there has a weathervane for Iowa. Apparently not Liz Warren. It not only shows how unsavvy she is about her own political interests, but also shows how callous the left is with regard to the concerns of ordinary Americans and their need for answers on why illegals are here. For Warren, the Democrat narrative, not the sentiment of the people right now, even if they are in New Hampshire or Iowa, is most important. That narrative, about family separations, that they've made so much political hay on, is paramount. Never mind Mollie. Let's switch back to family separations so President Trump's Cabinet officials can be run out of restaurants and Time magazine can cook up more fake Photoshops for its covers. Nothing better for making Democrats happy. Warren is not the only idiot on the left trying to change the topic. This Democratic strategist here is trying to change the topic to \"toxic masculinity\" (I think she means \"machismo,\" but that would be racist.) An AP correspondent joked about Mollie's death as Trump rally fodder. This MSNBC commentator dismissed her death as unimportant because she was \"a girl from Iowa\" instead of a person with a name. Stephen King made a jackass of himself, too, saying that since some worse murderers have been American, illegal murderers deserve a pass. One free murder, or something. They're all just trying to change the topic. Why is that? Because the reason we have 12 million or as many as 30 million illegals in this country is because of the Democrats' open borders and illegals-first policies, all in the name of building a loyal indigent voter base from the sort of people who vote Chavista back in their home countries. They aren't interested in Mollie, who's nothing but an interruption to their narrative and agenda. They are trying to change the subject because Mollie is a problem for them. Rest assured: if the 24-year-old murderer (brought here at age 8 by his family) who killed her had gotten separated from his family forever, as Warren laments, it would have been a good thing. Instead, Mollie Tibbetts got separated. So did Kate Steinle. So did all of these genuine Americans. I don't see any apology from Warren yet on her Twitter feed, so I think she's going to let those disgusting comments stand. Rest assured: Iowa will remember them. Let's hope she's blown up her presidential prospects right there. Image Credit: Phillio Publius via DeviantArt, CC BY-SA 2.0. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, brimming with big ambitions about being the \"first female president\" and currently the Democratic frontrunner for 2020, has really stepped in it for the coming kickoff in Iowa. Commenting on the totally preventable murder of 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts by an illegal alien who should have been thrown out years ago, the Massachusetts Democrat decided we were all making a big deal out of a nothingburger, so she would put it all in perspective for us: I'm so sorry for the family here and I know this is hard not only for the family but for the people in her community, the people throughout Iowa. But one of the things we have to remember is we need an immigration system that is effective, that focuses on where real problems are. Last month, I went down to the border and I saw where children had been taken away from their mothers. I met with those mothers who had been lied to, who didn't know where their children were, who hadn't had a chance to talk to their children. And there was no plan for how they would be reunified with their children. I think we need immigration laws that focus on people who pose a real threat and I don't think mamas and babies are the place we should be spending our resources. Separating a mama from a baby does not make this country safer. Did she really think we'd all like to change the topic to family separations of illegals caught breaking into the country illegally and their inconveniences while we've got another callous, brutal illegal alien murder of an innocent college student in front of us? Did she really think we wanted more images of crying toddlers, feeling a little rough after just crossing 1,000 miles of Mexican badlands in the tender hands of human smuggling cartels? And American citizen Mollie Tibbetts – err, \"a girl in Iowa\" – is reduced to nothing but a \"sorry, but\"? Note that Warren thinks it's an issue of concern only to Iowa and not the rest of us, though that rather sticks out, given her presidential ambitions. Iowa, see, is just so unimportant and unworthy of comment, unlike the inconveniences of illegals crossing illegally. Considering its leading role in the 2020 election, which makes Warren's remarks a little mind-boggling for their political stupidity, Iowa can do a lot of things to your dreams, Liz. Every politician out there has a weathervane for Iowa. Apparently not Liz Warren.

        "articles": "The opposite of \"right\" is both \"wrong\" and \"left\" – and these really are synonymous far more often than you might think. Most Democrats, for example, believe that the German Socialist Worker's Party was right-wing, see Democrats as heroes in the struggle for black civil rights, and rage against the fascist book-burners and revisionists denying evolution, human equality, and Chairman Mao's lifelong beneficence. It may not be true that some lies matter more than others, but it's certainly true that some lies reveal more than others. That's the case with Democrat efforts to remove the specter of Huckleberry Finn from American culture – because anyone can understand why denying Wilson's commitment to eugenics or FDR's support for the Kyoto Seven makes sense for a party pretty clearly on the wrong side of history, but the attempt to remake Mark Twain as a Democrat while erasing his work needs an explanation that's both subtler and broader. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an American parable in which Huck and the people around him evolve as Twain thought America should evolve: away from the stratified society symbolized by kings, dukes, and dear old dingbats fortified behind social barriers and white picket fences, and toward an egalitarian world in which intelligence and character count, but neither birth nor color does. Thus, the storyline turns on Huck's ability to transcend the culture in which he was raised to form a lasting friendship with that culture's ultimate bogeyman: Nigger Jim, an escaped slave met in the dark. But really it's about the the triumph of American idealism over its European heritage – a lesson the founders, along with John Locke and Jesus, would have understood as intended to inspire those who believe that individual moral goodness can combine with clear thinking to defeat the pretentious, the corrupt, and the politically correct. The truth about The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is therefore that the work preaches exactly the values, from equal rights and equal opportunity to environmental stewardship, Democrats claim to stand for – and yet they want to rewrite the work while banning the original. So why? The answer is that Mark Twain's America is the America they hate and fear – the example they don't want the rest of the world to see. Democrats, remember, are the people who have the neo-Nazi skinheads thinking of themselves as right-wingers; the 1%-ers who rail against the 1%, but who, when in power, always institute policies making the rich richer and the poor poorer; the people labeling Republicans anti-science Luddites while canceling science funding, preaching warmism, and denying human evolution to claim men and women equal to the point of interchangeability; the people who claim to hate racism but enforce race-based policies everywhere and always to the disadvantage of the poorest, the blackest, and the least educated amongst us. The vast majority of people who vote Democrat have absolutely no idea what it's all about – or whom they're really voting for. They think they should hate Huck Finn, for example, because Twain spells \"the n-word\" correctly – but as the Clintons probably know, the people who invented and paid for Obama certainly know, and \"Hanoi Jane,\" when she appeared in a movie to announce that the fancy dress she wore was a personal gift from Chairman Mao, seemed both prideful and truthful. So why? Because Huckleberry Finn is an American classic – because \"right\" generally means \"(factually or morally) correct,\" and that's a reality the national socialists controlling Democratic Party messaging through Sergei Eisenstein's Hollywood and media successors, including Wednesday's CNBC \"moderators,\" want desperately to suppress.

But another reason relates to something liberals despise: \"trickle down\" economics or, in respect to the increasing scarcity of used cars, the fact that low-income used car buyers do better when wealthier Americans (those who can afford new cars) do better. The reason used cars have gotten increasingly scarce and expensive is the subject of a Wall Street Journal article, \"Amid New Car Boom, Used Cars Are Gold.\" Its observations are illuminating: The shortage of used cars stems from the deep plunge in new-car sales between 2008 and 2010, and the virtual disappearance of new-car leases during the financial crisis. As a result, three-year-old cars are now hard to find and even older models are holding their value. Another factor is a change by the three Detroit U.S. auto makers. To keep factories humming, they once leased tens of thousands of new cars to rental car fleets and then moved them onto dealer lots as used models after a few months. There are fewer of those vehicles because manufacturers cut excess production capacity in recent years. Cash-for-clunkers rebates also took many older vehicles off the road. The scarcity has pushed up used car prices, often to the point that consumers who finance a purchase with subsidized interest rates can get brand new vehicles for about the same as a monthly payment required for a late-model used car. A 2013 Toyota Corolla LE now sells for about $18,000 new and a 2010 model costs about $14,200. However, monthly payments would be about $300 for each, assuming the new-car buyer gets Toyota's 1.9% for 60 months rate and the used-car buyer pays a 5% or higher interest rate. A used car dealership in Texas once put up an amusing ad on its billboard: \"If you have a car, you can get a job!\" Now, you have to wonder how many Americans can no longer afford a used car - and are suffering as a consequences or even unemployed. But, hey, look at this from the perspective of Obama and Democratic elites. Fewer used cars means less pollution and a greener planet. Like in Europe, more Americans will thus ride bicycles and take the bus. In the end, this benefits every American - and even the entire planet.

A time period that many of us had never thought would happen in America. A time period where we shudder to think what our children and children's children might live under. Certainly, the worst of times that we have known. What is becoming increasingly clear is that America is disintegrating into two warring factions. For most of the 20th century, Americans had about 35% of the voters voting conservative/Republican and 35% voting liberal/Democrat, with a healthy 30% in the middle. This 30% in the middle kept us from tearing apart. Kept us sane and balanced. But since 2000, voters and voting patterns began to change dramatically. Now, in 2021, about 48% of the voters view themselves as RedState Patriots, and about 48% of the voters view themselves as BlueState Progressives. This leaves a slim 4% (if that much) in the middle.Americans need to start asking themselves, \"Is this what we really want?\" Is the country being so deeply divided and fractured what we really desire? Or is it basically okay because we just don't have that much in common anymore? Some have stated that maybe it is time for a peaceful, nonviolent dissolution from each other. But is this what we really want?Imagine the two separate belief systems. Notice how diametrically different Side A is from Side B. Be aware of just how different the cultures, customs, and norms are. Notice that the two sides do not resemble each other at all, and they look as if they had two separate histories; they certainly look as if they are demanding extremely different futures. And one characteristic that makes it more crucial is that the red states and the blue states can be found by locations and regions. Red and blue states do not look like a checkerboard evenly spread out throughout America. They are heavily regionalized. Because of this regionalization, it becomes much easier to separate. If it looked like a checkerboard, evenly distributed, it would not be easy to divide. Equally disturbing is that recent polls show that a high percentage of Americans, when questioned about their region, would just as soon dissolve the unity. A little scary and ominous. Californians don't think much of Floridians. Texans don't think much of New Yorkers. Oregon and Washington don't think much of Mississippi and Alabama. And New Jersey and Massachusetts don't think much of Indiana and Kentucky. The hatred, mistrust, and real paranoia are getting deeper and wider. Just look at the real stark differences in culture, customs, values, beliefs, and expectations between the red states and the blue states.* Red states believe that once vaccinated, they need not wear a mask again. And \"oh, by the way,\" why do I have to wear a mask if the vaccine actually works? While blue states appear to look forward to and cherish more masks, more lockdowns, and more government control of our lives. And blue states insist that they never promised anything with regard to the effectiveness of the vaccine. * Red states are no longer listening to the CDC and Fauci, while blue states believe that Fauci's words are from Mt. Sinai, and they follow the CDC guidelines with Jonestown-like obedience.* Red states believe that the Second Amendment was written specifically for the individual, for the common man. Blue states believe that the Second Amendment is only for the government and also for their own private security teams. * Blue states believe that the rioting and violence and murders and theft that took place last summer were free speech, while red states believed that these were felonies, and thus active participants should go to jail. * Red states believe that the J-6 \"Stop the Steal\" rally was free speech and constitutionally protected. Blue states believe that those individuals should go to jail, without due process, without a trial, and should be held in solitary confinement 23 to 24 hours per day.* Red states believe that All Lives Matter to God. Blue states believe that Black Lives Matter, and if you say All Lives Matter, you are then a racist.* Red states believe \"my body, my choice\" when it comes to the vaccine, while blue states believe \"my body, my choice\" when it comes to the baby in the womb.*Red states believe that God is the creator and is the One who gives us freedom, liberty, responsibility, and choice. Blue states believe that government is the creator and the entity that takes care of them from the womb to the tomb. Blue states believe that government is the answer. Red states believe government is usually the problem.* Red states believe that all discrimination based on skin color is wrong, while blue states believe that some discrimination by skin color is justified and noble and is \"payback\" for past sins.* Blue states believe that we should not have borders unless it is to hold the Cuban refugees back and thus keep them under communist tyranny. Red states believe we must have borders, except we should allow Cubans to escape communism 90 miles away from our shore.* Red states believe that locking down our economy, shuttering our schools and churches, putting masks back on, and confining Americans back to a China-like existence should be the absolute last option and choice if it even is an option at all. Blue states believe that shutting down churches, schools, and individual homes should be the first consideration, right out of the box, when the next China COVID virus scare comes along.* Red states believe in capitalism, free markets, competition, and less government. Blue states believe in socialism, Deep State politics, government control, and censorship of unwelcome ideas and thoughts and voices. * Red states believe that it is wrong for the FBI, CIA, and NSA to surveil and spy on Americans in America just because they have a different point of view and disagree with the Progressive Deep State government. Blue states believe that those people should be censored, canceled, and put in jail by the government. Blue states no longer believe in free speech, free thought, and \"all ideas are welcome at the table of debate.\" * Red states believe that it is egregious for the Deep State spying apparatuses to spy on and intimidate journalists and members of the press. Blue states believe that \"freedom of the press\" is only for blue-state journalists. Only for CNN, MSNBC, the Washington Post, and the N.Y. Times.* Red states believe that it is justified to use the military to keep our borders secure and to keep illegal aliens out of our country. Blue states believe that it is okay to use the military to help move around illegal aliens into our heartland, even if they have not been tested for COVID or taken the vaccine. * Blue states believe that everyone should have the vaccine unless you're an illegal alien, and then, no problem, come on in un-vaccinated and un-tested. Red states believe that the vaccine is an individual choice and that the individual alone bears that responsibility.* Red states believe that it is wrong to censor, to mandate masks, to cancel and remove controversial or non-government-approved ideas, thoughts, and voices. Blue states believe in censorship, canceling, and destroying people with views they disagree with.* Blue states believe that Animal Farm, 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451 are novels of a totalitarian future. Red states believe that these novels are now current events and on our front page each and every day.* Red states believe that China should pay America at least $10 trillion in reparations for the damage its China virus has done. Blue states say the China COVID virus is...wait for it...President Trump's fault. * Blue states believe that Dr. Fauci saved America from extinction. Red states believe that Dr. Fauci should be behind bars.* Red states believe that our Founding Fathers were imperfect heroes and should be respected. Blue states believe that our Founding Fathers were despicable criminals whose names, monuments, and words should be \"whited out\" of our history books.* Red states believe in equal justice, equal penalties, and equal jail time for all crimes committed. Blue states advocate a different level of responsibility for crime based on socio-economic and pigmentation factors.* Red states believe that defunding the police is suicidal. Blue states agree and are fine with the suicide of our nation.* Red states believe we must have tighter, stricter election laws for a fair and free election. Blue states do not want a fair and free election.* Red states believe that America is an exceptional country that has done great things but has also committed sins as a country. Blue states believe that America is anything but exceptional and must be destroyed. Red states believe in 1776, while blue states believe in 1619.* Red states believe that the last presidential election was stolen. Really, really stolen, and that Biden is illegitimate. Blue states believe this, too, but so what? Shut up, or go to jail.The vision for the future of America seems so very different today between the red states and blue states. The common ground is shrinking. The values that hold us together seem to be nonexistent at times. The shared future goals appear to be disappearing. Can the 4% in the middle hold us together? Can the \"purple states\" find enough compromises and inclusions in the middle to cement the opposing ends? One is not terribly optimistic at this time.When the Progressive Deep State that took office just six months ago and now wants to put its political adversaries (political prisoners) in jail for an undetermined time period...one is not optimistic. We should be worried that Lincoln's warning and Khrushchev's boast might come true.One must remember from Dickens's classic that revolutions have a history of eating their own. Biden, Progressives, BLM, and Antifa might want to study the final days of Robespierre, Trotsky, and Che. This is a cautionary tale of bad times that could get much worse.Image: MasterTux via Pixabay, Pixabay License.To comment, you can find the MeWe post for this article here.

Blue states believe that Black Lives Matter, and if you say All Lives Matter, you are then a racist. * Red states believe \"my body, my choice\" when it comes to the vaccine, while blue states believe \"my body, my choice\" when it comes to the baby in the womb. *Red states believe that God is the creator and is the One who gives us freedom, liberty, responsibility, and choice. Blue states believe that government is the creator and the entity that takes care of them from the womb to the tomb. Blue states believe that government is the answer. Red states believe government is usually the problem. * Red states believe that all discrimination based on skin color is wrong, while blue states believe that some discrimination by skin color is justified and noble and is \"payback\" for past sins. * Blue states believe that we should not have borders unless it is to hold the Cuban refugees back and thus keep them under communist tyranny. Red states believe we must have borders, except we should allow Cubans to escape communism 90 miles away from our shore. * Red states believe that locking down our economy, shuttering our schools and churches, putting masks back on, and confining Americans back to a China-like existence should be the absolute last option and choice if it even is an option at all. Blue states believe that shutting down churches, schools, and individual homes should be the first consideration, right out of the box, when the next China COVID virus scare comes along. * Red states believe in capitalism, free markets, competition, and less government. Blue states believe in socialism, Deep State politics, government control, and censorship of unwelcome ideas and thoughts and voices. * Red states believe that it is wrong for the FBI, CIA, and NSA to surveil and spy on Americans in America just because they have a different point of view and disagree with the Progressive Deep State government. Blue states believe that those people should be censored, canceled, and put in jail by the government. Blue states no longer believe in free speech, free thought, and \"all ideas are welcome at the table of debate.\" * Red states believe that it is egregious for the Deep State spying apparatuses to spy on and intimidate journalists and members of the press. Blue states believe that \"freedom of the press\" is only for blue-state journalists. Only for CNN, MSNBC, the Washington Post, and the N.Y. Times. * Red states believe that it is justified to use the military to keep our borders secure and to keep illegal aliens out of our country. Blue states believe that it is okay to use the military to help move around illegal aliens into our heartland, even if they have not been tested for COVID or taken the vaccine. * Blue states believe that everyone should have the vaccine unless you're an illegal alien, and then, no problem, come on in un-vaccinated and un-tested. Red states believe that the vaccine is an individual choice and that the individual alone bears that responsibility. * Red states believe that it is wrong to censor, to mandate masks, to cancel and remove controversial or non-government-approved ideas, thoughts, and voices. Blue states believe in censorship, canceling, and destroying people with views they disagree with. * Blue states believe that Animal Farm, 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451 are novels of a totalitarian future. Red states believe that these novels are now current events and on our front page each and every day. * Red states believe that China should pay America at least $10 trillion in reparations for the damage its China virus has done. Blue states say the China COVID virus is...wait for it...President Trump's fault. * Blue states believe that Dr. Fauci saved America from extinction. Red states believe that Dr. Fauci should be behind bars. * Red states believe that our Founding Fathers were imperfect heroes and should be respected. Blue states believe that our Founding Fathers were despicable criminals whose names, monuments, and words should be \"whited out\" of our history books. * Red states believe in equal justice, equal penalties, and equal jail time for all crimes committed. Blue states advocate a different level of responsibility for crime based on socio-economic and pigmentation factors. * Red states believe that defunding the police is suicidal. Blue states agree and are fine with the suicide of our nation. * Red states believe we must have tighter, stricter election laws for a fair and free election. Blue states do not want a fair and free election. * Red states believe that America is an exceptional country that has done great things but has also committed sins as a country. Blue states believe that America is anything but exceptional and must be destroyed. Red states believe in 1776, while blue states believe in 1619. * Red states believe that the last presidential election was stolen. Really, really stolen, and that Biden is illegitimate. Blue states believe this, too, but so what? Shut up, or go to jail. The vision for the future of America seems so very different today between the red states and blue states. The common ground is shrinking. The values that hold us together seem to be nonexistent at times. The shared future goals appear to be disappearing. Can the 4% in the middle hold us together? Can the \"purple states\" find enough compromises and inclusions in the middle to cement the opposing ends? One is not terribly optimistic at this time. When the Progressive Deep State that took office just six months ago and now wants to put its political adversaries (political prisoners) in jail for an undetermined time period...one is not optimistic. We should be worried that Lincoln's warning and Khrushchev's boast might come true. One must remember from Dickens's classic that revolutions have a history of eating their own. Biden, Progressives, BLM, and Antifa might want to study the final days of Robespierre, Trotsky, and Che. This is a cautionary tale of bad times that could get much worse.

        "articles": "A comment made by one of President Obama’s closest aides explains his blasé attitude toward the lives of Americans. In late 2012, Neera Tanden, who had been one of President Obama’s closest aides, observed: Clinton, being Clinton, had plenty of advice in mind and was desperate to impart it. But for the first two years of Obama’s term, the phone calls Clinton kept expecting rarely came. “People say the reason Obama wouldn’t call Clinton is because he doesn’t like him,” observes Tanden. “The truth is, Obama doesn’t call anyone, and he’s not close to almost anyone. It’s stunning that he’s in politics, because he really doesn’t like people. Barack Obama had been warned that leaving Iraq without a residual American force could lead to genocide. When questioned about this risk, he complacently answered that preventing genocide was not a good enough reason to have troops in Iraq . Barack Obama’s coldness towards Americans -- and others, for that matter -- was obvious before 2012. Barack Obama has long had an Empathy Deficit, as I wrote in 2010. He easily and coldly boasted he would destroy the coal industry and kill thousands of jobs with the aplomb of Chairman Mao and Josef Stalin reengineering their societies. The jobs that were promised after passage of the trillion-dollar stimulus plan never materialized because as Barack Obama jocularly put it two years later “shovel-ready was not as shovel ready as we expected.” When Texas was hit with devastating forest fires, Obama was cracking jokes at a California fundraiser, “You’ve got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change.” He has articulated his contempt for so called everyday Americans many times (see my 2012 column, What Obama Thinks of Americans and my 2014 column, Obama Thinks You Are Stupid, That’s Why) Barack Obama seems particularly complacent when it comes to Americans endangered and murdered by Islamic extremists. Here are some examples (with more undoubtedly to come as President Obama oversees a massive influx of Muslims into America, hence fulfilling his promise to “fundamentally transform America”). Obama’s Syrian asylum policy continues apace, despite the role of at least one Syrian “refugee” in the massacres in Paris. Obama wants to welcome at least 10,000 more Syrians into America (Hillary wants 65,000). What could go wrong? Ben Rhodes, Obama’s chief liar now that Susan Rice has outlived her usefulness in that role, appeared on numerous broadcasts to assure us these “asylum seekers” will be thoroughly vetted to eliminate security risks -- contradicting the widely respected FBI chief, James Comey, who testified before Congress that vetting Syrian “refugees” will be challenging. Can’t we trust the competency of an administration who can handle the IRS, the VA, the stimulus program, green energy projects, and security of government employee records so well? When Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl was murdered by Islamic terrorists the best that Barack Obama could offer was that his “loss” had “captured the imagination of the world.” Captured the imagination? Mark Steyn had some choice words for Obama’s lazy tribute to Daniel Pearl. There was no indignation or rage. First of all, note the passivity: \"The loss of Daniel Pearl.\" He wasn't \"lost.\" He was kidnapped and beheaded. He was murdered on a snuff video. He was specifically targeted, seized as a trophy, a high-value scalp. And the circumstances of his \"loss\" merit some vigor in the prose. Yet Obama can muster none. (snip) Well, says the president, it was \"one of those moments that captured the world's imagination.\" Really? Evidently it never captured Obama's imagination because, if it had, he could never have uttered anything so fatuous. He seems literally unable to imagine Pearl's fate, and so, cruising on autopilot, he reaches for the all-purpose bromides of therapeutic sedation: \"one of those moments\" – you know, like Princess Di's wedding, Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction, whatever – \"that captured the world's imagination.\" After Barack Obama announced that American journalist James Foley had been beheaded by Islamic extremists he raced off to the links to yuck it up with NBA star Alanzo Mourning and others. George Bush gave up golf as president because he felt it unseemly for a commander-in-chief to be playing golf while Americans were serving overseas in the military. Clearly Obama has different seemliness standards (see his interview with the YouTube comedian GloZell who bathes in milk and cereal in a bathtub). When Americans were killed in Benghazi the White House refused to give an honest accounting of who murdered them (it was an offshoot of Al Qaeda). Their deaths were, in Obama’s cold phrasing, were not “optimal.” Well, they certainly weren’t optimal for him and his re-election campaign, so he and his Praetorian guard lied about their murders. Who got the blame? An obscure Coptic Christian who had directed an equally obscure video that may have riled some Muslims -- had they seen it (which, basically, no one had). The spin was that Muslims had been (“legitimately”?) enraged by the video that mocked Mohammed. Survivors were lied to and are still awaiting a call from the President to honestly explain why their loved ones had been murdered. They will be waiting a long time. At times, he seems intent on justifying Islamic terrorism,or at least relativizing such violence by putting it in “historical context.” Last year, at the National Prayer breakfast (of all places) he invoked the Crusades while talking about Islam and terrorism: At the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, Obama noted there was a time when people mass-murdered in the name of Christianity, too: And lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ. As many were quick to point out, the Catholic Church's Crusades began more than 900 years ago, and the Inquisition began in the 13th century. The comparison was absurd but part of a pattern of Obama being an apologist for Islamic terrorism. The violence perpetrated by Muslim terrorist never has anything to do with Islam in the rose-colored view of Barack Obama and his officials and they have all but covered up the role played by Islam in the murder of Americans. John Kennedy wrote of Winston Churchill “he mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.” Barack Obama has thumbed through the thesaurus and mobilized the English language in ways that George Orwell had foreseen -- as a way for regimes to hide the truth from people. In this case, camouflaging an enemy. The Muslim Brotherhood becomes a “mostly secular” group-this gem from Obama’s Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. Islamic terrorist attacks become “man-caused disasters.” The 2009 Fort Hood massacre is described as a case of “workplace violence” despite the murderer, Nidal Hassan, having business cards describing him as a “soldier of Allah.” When a Chattanooga Navy recruitment center was attacked by Mohammad Abdulazeez, a Muslim who justified his attack because he was displeased by America’s war on terror (and therefore committed terror), the White House all but ignored the murder of our Navy personnel. Those murders merited almost zero notice. The White House has focused a lot of attention on violence on college campuses but was silent in the wake of the recent stabbing spree by Faisal Mohammed at a California university campus. One wonders at what point, to paraphrase Hillary Clinton, did American lives ever matter to Barack Obama? After all, his moral compass, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Jr., celebrated 9/11 as America’s chickens having come to roost and routinely spouted anti-American diatribes as Barack Obama and his family stayed in the pews (Oprah Winfrey and others quit the church). Israel’s Ambassador to America, Michael Oren, read both of Obama’s books and what struck him the most was that Barack Obama never had one good thing to say about America. Not one. Is that what they teach at private prep and Ivy League schools or was that an ideology inherited from his parents? Meanwhile, Barack Obama extolls the role of Islam in America and the world, fabricating history to do so. He also fabricates in real time, too: erasing the role as much as he can of Islamic radicalism in violence around the world. Indeed, “Islamic radicalism” and “Islamic terrorists” are banished from the lexicon of Obama and all his officials. If one cannot name an enemy it makes it harder to fight them. Maybe that is the point. Compare and contrast the treatment meted out to the Cambridge policemen who were merely doing their job when they merely arrested Barack Obama’s friend, Henry Louis Gates Jr., for apparent breaking and entering. From his perch in the White House Obama called the police “stupid” and indicted police nationwide for racism. One can do the same exercise regarding Obama’s complacency when Americans are killed by Muslims to his over the top reaction to the deaths of Trayvon Martin (“if I had a son he would have looked like Trayvon”) and Michael Brown -- both cases cleared the people who shot them as having done so in self-defense, despite the efforts of the federal government to coerce state governments to find otherwise. Do some American lives matter more to Barack Obama than others? Given the disparate treatment shown one can speculate so. Meanwhile, a Texas high-school boy whose feelings were hurt when a teacher confiscated what appeared to be a bomb but what he represented as being a clock he had built (and was probably just a disassembled Radio Shack clock) was acclaimed as a Muslim Rosa Parks and granted a White House visit. The whole affair now appears to have been a contrived effort by the his activist father to create a cause celebre and another Muslim martyr (though not in the most radical sense, though now that the family has moved to Qatar…that clock making may come in handy). President Obama has an agenda that is becoming increasingly visible. Marc Thiessen recently wrote in the Washington Post of “Obama’s stubborn, willful complacency on terror”: Somehow, to paraphrase President Obama, it has become routine — the president dismisses the terrorist threat, only to see terrorists carry out horrific attacks that give lie to his complacency. On Sept. 6, 2012, Obama boasted at the Democratic National Convention that “al-Qaeda is on the path to defeat.” Five days later, al-Qaeda-linked terrorists attacked two U.S. diplomatic compounds in Benghazi, Libya, killing the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. On Jan. 7, 2014, Obama dismissed the Islamic State as the “JV” team in an interview with the New Yorker, adding that the rise of the Islamic State was not “a direct threat to us or something that we have to wade into.” That same month, the Islamic State began its march on Iraq, declaring a caliphate, burning people alive in cages and beheading Americans. Then on Thursday, Obama did it again, telling ABC News, “I don’t think [the Islamic State is] gaining strength” and promising “we have contained them.” The very next day, the Islamic State launched the worst attack on Paris since World War II, killing at least 132 people and wounding more than 350 others. How many times is this sad spectacle going to repeat itself? Well, chronologically, for at least one more year. Barack Obama is not interested in pursuing a war against radical Islam -- he doesn’t think there is or should be a “war on terror” (another banished phrase) and seems more intent on burnishing Islam, even if it is at our expense and at the cost of our lives. Neera Tanden was right; he doesn’t like people and couldn’t care less what happens to (most) of us: our lives don’t matter. A comment made by one of President Obama’s closest aides explains his blasé attitude toward the lives of Americans. In late 2012, Neera Tanden, who had been one of President Obama’s closest aides, observed: Clinton, being Clinton, had plenty of advice in mind and was desperate to impart it.

        "articles": "Red lines are not real for the Obama administration. That does not mean I have any brilliant solutions for what to do about Syria, where the choices are far worse now than a year ago, when we first started dithering. However, the lack of resolve, and the failure to take seriously the redlines we ourselves set, suggests that no assurances the Obama team has provided Israel on preventing Iran from joining the nuclear club can be taken seriously. We will punt, and switch to a containment strategy if Iran gets the bomb. Only action by Israel can delay this. In fact, the Administration seems more interested in reviving the appearance of a peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, than in dealing with Iran. John Kerry has allies in this approach as Alan Dershowitz tries his hand at negotiations. He should stick to defending Claus Von Bulow and O.J. Simpson. You know the Obama team is displaying weakness and incompetence when Jamie Rubin (Mr. Christiane Ammanpour) lashes out. Iran is at the nuclear breakout stage. Andrew Roberts make the historical case for pre-emptive Israeli action against Iran. Caroline Glick argues it is time for Israel to confront the United States for its empty headed policy about radical Islam. Jonathan Tobin on how our Syrian inaction signals our intentions on Iran. 2. With the report today of the arrest of 3 more suspects in the Boston marathon bombings, the MSNBC/New York Times argument that we just need to treat immigrants better so they can assimilate and not blow up their neighbors, seem to be wearing a little thin. Looks like both the Saudi Arabia and the Russians knew Tsarnaev was a bad guy, but the FBI, trained to think that the real threat is Islamophobia, not radical Islamic terrorism, may have blown it. Mark Steyn is not a big fan of the :we all failed the Tsarnaevs line\" Eric Holder, arguably the worst attorney general in history, and a man who is concerned with racial redistribution and sensitivities, and not much else, claims that Muslims were subject to numerous attacks in this country after 9/11. That is demonstrably false (thee is one confirmed revenge murder). Attacks on Jews regularly are 10 times the number of attacks on Muslims every year. 3. I remember walking into the Post Office and scanning the ten most wanted list, and seeing a bunch of bank robbers. Not anymore. 4. There is a reason why conservatives are skeptical about government spending. We believe a lot of it is wasted and designed primarily to reward certain groups or companies. I am no fan of crony capitalism, at an all-time high in this administration, or the racial payouts like the Pigford scandal, that even the New York Times finds objectionable. 5. Support for Obamacare has dropped to an all-time low, 35%. This is from a Kaiser Foundation survey, an ardent supporter of the program. It is becoming increasingly difficult to argue that the slowdown in hiring (the weakest recovery in 80 years), is not in part attributable to the incentives and disincentives created by this bill. 6. On the Illinois front, the Democrats in Springfield fail again to consider pension reform. Too hard, I guess, to take on the unions who put you in office. Meanwhile the state finances continue to crumble as education funding is cut to pay for the pensions. Want to see the blue state governance at work? Come to Illinois On the first warm night of the season, a mere 20 Chicagoans are shot. Chicago comes up short with only 4 of the top 25 violent crime neighborhoods in America, as Detroit takes the top 3 spots. Think about a place where 1 of every 15 residents is a victim of violent crime in a year. At least the Blackhawks won their playoff opener in a nail biter in overtime 2 to 1. 7. Al Gore keeps peddling his doom for a few hundred thousand per speech, but fewer open-minded people are buying his climate change hysteria. The second coldest start to spring in US history: And out at Mount Rainier. 8. As a result of this article, I cancelled my subscription to Scientific American. Some of us know this is a bad study. Red lines are not real for the Obama administration. That does not mean I have any brilliant solutions for what to do about Syria, where the choices are far worse now than a year ago, when we first started dithering. However, the lack of resolve, and the failure to take seriously the redlines we ourselves set, suggests that no assurances the Obama team has provided Israel on preventing Iran from joining the nuclear club can be taken seriously. We will punt, and switch to a containment strategy if Iran gets the bomb. Only action by Israel can delay this. In fact, the Administration seems more interested in reviving the appearance of a peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, than in dealing with Iran. John Kerry has allies in this approach as Alan Dershowitz tries his hand at negotiations. He should stick to defending Claus Von Bulow and O.J. Simpson. You know the Obama team is displaying weakness and incompetence when Jamie Rubin (Mr. Christiane Ammanpour) lashes out. Iran is at the nuclear breakout stage. Andrew Roberts make the historical case for pre-emptive Israeli action against Iran. Caroline Glick argues it is time for Israel to confront the United States for its empty headed policy about radical Islam. Jonathan Tobin on how our Syrian inaction signals our intentions on Iran. 2. With the report today of the arrest of 3 more suspects in the Boston marathon bombings, the MSNBC/New York Times argument that we just need to treat immigrants better so they can assimilate and not blow up their neighbors, seem to be wearing a little thin. Looks like both the Saudi Arabia and the Russians knew Tsarnaev was a bad guy, but the FBI, trained to think that the real threat is Islamophobia, not radical Islamic terrorism, may have blown it. Mark Steyn is not a big fan of the :we all failed the Tsarnaevs line\" Eric Holder, arguably the worst attorney general in history, and a man who is concerned with racial redistribution and sensitivities, and not much else, claims that Muslims were subject to numerous attacks in this country after 9/11. That is demonstrably false (thee is one confirmed revenge murder). Attacks on Jews regularly are 10 times the number of attacks on Muslims every year. 3. I remember walking into the Post Office and scanning the ten most wanted list, and seeing a bunch of bank robbers. Not anymore. 4. There is a reason why conservatives are skeptical about government spending. We believe a lot of it is wasted and designed primarily to reward certain groups or companies. I am no fan of crony capitalism, at an all-time high in this administration, or the racial payouts like the Pigford scandal, that even the New York Times finds objectionable. 5. Support for Obamacare has dropped to an all-time low, 35%. This is from a Kaiser Foundation survey, an ardent supporter of the program. It is becoming increasingly difficult to argue that the slowdown in hiring (the weakest recovery in 80 years), is not in part attributable to the incentives and disincentives created by this bill. 6. On the Illinois front, the Democrats in Springfield fail again to consider pension reform. Too hard, I guess, to take on the unions who put you in office. Meanwhile the state finances continue to crumble as education funding is cut to pay for the pensions. Want to see the blue state governance at work? Come to Illinois On the first warm night of the season, a mere 20 Chicagoans are shot. Chicago comes up short with only 4 of the top 25 violent crime neighborhoods in America, as Detroit takes the top 3 spots. Think about a place where 1 of every 15 residents is a victim of violent crime in a year. At least the Blackhawks won their playoff opener in a nail biter in overtime 2 to 1. 7. Al Gore keeps peddling his doom for a few hundred thousand per speech, but fewer open-minded people are buying his climate change hysteria. The second coldest start to spring in US history: And out at Mount Rainier. 8. As a result of this article, I cancelled my subscription to Scientific American. Some of us know this is a bad study.",

        "articles": "The blood of the nine victims shot by a deranged criminal at a South Carolina church had barely dried when, as if on cue, President Obama and his “point man” on gun control, Vice President Biden, stepped up to the microphones to issue a thinly veiled call for more gun control. “I’ve had to make statements like this too many times,” Obama began, prefacing his comments, as he always does, with concern not for the victims or the country, but for himself, as he did after the Sandy Hook shooting – characterizing it as the “worst day” of “my presidency.” “We don’t have all the facts” – just like with arrest of Prof. “Skip” Gates, not having all the facts didn’t stop him from holding forth – “but we do know that once again innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun.” (Translation: We need to ban guns.) Then came another of Obama’s signature rhetorical techniques: denigrate the United States and claim that other countries do things better: “This kind of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.” Obama is simply flat-out wrong about that, on two counts. First, “this kind of mass violence” does happen in other countries – and it happens in countries with ultra-strict gun control laws, like the United Kingdom, Norway, Canada, and Germany. Some of those countries tightened already stringent gun laws following mass shootings; for instance, the United Kingdom banned and confiscated all civilian handguns in 1997 following the shooting of schoolchildren in Dunblane, Scotland, but that didn’t stop a man from killing 12 people with a registered shotgun and bolt-action .22 rifle in Cumbria in 2010. Second – and more important – is this: historically, most of the “mass violence” in “other countries” has been conducted by governments, not deranged individuals. Nine American churchgoers shot by a criminal is certainly awful, but let’s put it in the proper perspective. Criminal violence by private individuals in the U.S. pales in comparison to what governments in “other advanced countries” have done. Germany, an “advanced” country that killed six million disarmed Jews, resorted to the “efficiency” of the death camp and the gas chamber for the “Final Solution” because shooting the Jews was too difficult logistically. The Germans knew this, because they tried it: they shot nearly 34,000 Jews in 48 hours in Kiev in 1941. The Soviet Union, which was “advanced” enough to put a satellite in orbit before the U.S. could, killed some five million Ukrainians during the Holodomor of the 1930s, and Vasily Blokhin, Stalin’s top executioner, personally shot some 7,000 Poles in the Katyn Massacre during World War II – at a rate of one every three minutes. During Mao’s “Great Leap Forward,” an estimated 25 million Chinese died; Pol Pot had nearly half of Cambodia’s population shot in the mid-1970s; and the Turks killed some 1.5 million Armenians in 1915. The people who carried out these crimes wore the uniforms of their countries and did their duty for their government. The Founders bequeathed us the Second Amendment because they knew perfectly well that the likes of Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook shooter; Seung-Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech shooter; and Dylann Roof, the accused South Carolina church shooter, could just as easily have ended up wearing the uniform of the SS, the Khmer Rouge, or the NKVD, and done far more damage than they did as private citizens. That’s a lesson we ought not forget as the braying for more gun control begins in the media. (It’s worth noting that the last time the nation’s attention was focused on Charleston was in April, when an unarmed Walter Scott was fatally shot in the back by a police officer wearing a government badge). If Dylann Roof had hung around that Bible study group long enough to actually learn something, one of the things he would have learned is that Jesus was killed not by a deranged criminal – but by the government. Recent polling data has indicated that Christianity is in steep decline in America. Perhaps there is a link between the willingness of criminals to commit mass murder and increased atheism – after all, the murderous governments of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Red China, Cambodia, and Ottoman Turkey were all either officially atheist or, in the case of Turkey, non-Christian. “At some point,” Obama concluded, “it’s going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it, and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively.” Perhaps, Mr. President, the American people need to come to grips with the decline in Christianity instead. The last thing we want to do is emulate all those other “advanced” countries.
