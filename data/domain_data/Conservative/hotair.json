        "articles": "Is the #NeverTrump movement becoming primarily a shell which is rapidly hollowing out? The national polling is beginning to inevitably shift away from the primaries and more to the general election in November, hopefully providing some clarity as to the early condition of the race to come. Bernie is still in there fighting against Hillary, but it’s clearly a case of tilting at windmills at this point. (Barring a quick indictment of Clinton, anyway. The Superdelegates can always bail out Sanders if that’s the case.) On the GOP side there is a larger concern to be dealt with. Assuming Donald Trump is officially named as our standar bearer in Cleveland he will have a tough fight on his hands no matter which Democrat he faces. That challenge will be further compounded if he can’t solidify the support of his own party’s voters across the nation. We are getting some of the earliest indications of how that will play out this week with the latest NBC News poll of general election preferences now that The Donald has cleared the field. The news isn’t great for the GOP, but hardly as bad as some of the doom and gloom prognosticators have been preaching. (See the full results here.) Much of the focus has been on the top lines, as usual. They’ve still got Hillary beating Trump, but the gap is much narrower than has been previously advertised at 49 percent to 44. Sanders does considerably better, and NBC chooses to focus a fair amount of their coverage on that slice of the numbers. But there’s one highly interesting bit of data in here which you have to do some digging to find. How many Republicans (and Republican leaners) are ready to get on the Trump Train no matter which Democrat he faces? NBC starts off focusing on “young voters” under the age of thirty so they can continue highlighting Bernie’s strength in that group. About 30 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners under 30 would vote for Sanders over Trump. The support Sanders gains among young Republican is surprising as research has consistently shown that party identification is the strongest predictor of vote choice. When faced with a Clinton-Trump ticket, 18 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters under 30 would support Clinton; 78 percent would support Trump. Pay close attention to that last, highlighted figure. When NBC gets down to testing the number of Republicans who will support Trump in the general election against presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton, the figure for only those age 30 and under is 78%. What you have dig deeper to find is that when you sample all Republicans and leaners of all ages, 85% are signing up to go with Trump. And this is only a week after he finished clearing the field and months in advance of the convention when it will almost certainly become official. Keep in mind that 93% of Republicans voted for Romney in 2012 while 6% voted for Barack Obama. As I’ve discussed here before, it can be easy for some of us to think that the #NeverTrump movement is still roaring if your perception is formed from social media. A large number of the people I follow on Twitter come from the ranks of the writers at National Review, RedState and a few other sites which are firmly entrenched in the camp of stopping Trump no matter the cost. On a daily basis I see repeated mantras which include things such as, “What part of “never” didn’t you understand?” When you’re exposed to that constantly it’s easy to wonder if the entire Republican population isn’t ready to walk off the field and either support or give in to Hillary Clinton. (And whether you’re voting for her, a third party candidate or leaving the POTUS slot on your ballot blank, it’s all the same thing.) But I’ve continued to have a sense that this is a very vocal, highly visible group of authors who are not going to wind up representing the majority of rank and file GOP voters around the nation. In fact, they’ll likely wind up speaking for only a marginal handful of dead-enders by the time we get to November. These early numbers from NBC seem to be showing that the transition is happening even faster than I’d anticipated. If Trump is already getting the backing of 85% of Republicans in early May, he’s got the entire summer and into autumn to round up another eight percent and at least get to parity with Romney. And the more those remaining fifteen percent have to sit and ponder the idea of actually helping elect Hillary Clinton, the easier that task will likely become. ",

        "articles": "The FBI is being accused of forming a wall around Hillary Clinton over the Clintonemail server. The latest battle happened in court yesterday when the FBI flat-out said no to the State Department on what information could be found on the email server, citing federal policy. “At this time, consistent with long-standing Department of Justice and FBI policy, we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any ongoing investigation, nor are we in a position to provide additional information at this time.” This shouldn’t be surprising because law enforcement tends to be pretty protective into what they’re investigating. The FBI wouldn’t comment on their probe into Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price for about three years before federal prosecutors finally indicted him last year. The problem is they’re being ordered by a federal judge to talk to the State Department. This has caused Judicial Watch to raise legitimate concerns to Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on how, and if, the FBI is conducting their investigation into Clinton (emphasis mine). “We still do not know whether the FBI — or any other government agency for that matter — has possession of the email server that was used by Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin to conduct official government business during their four years of employment at the State Department. We also do not know whether the server purportedly in the possession of the FBI — an assumption based on unsworn statements by third parties — is the actual email server that was used by Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Abedin to conduct official government business during their four years of employment at the State Department or whether it is a copy of such an email server. Nor do we know whether any copies of the email server or copies of the records from the email server exist.” Boy wouldn’t THAT be interesting if the server the FBI has isn’t even the real server. That would turn this entire Clintonemail case into a conspiracy straight from a Robert Ludlum or Garth Ennis book. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton went as far as to tell POLITICO the FBI and State Department might as well be in cahoots. “The FBI has evidently decided to stonewall the court’s legitimate inquiry here and the State Department is going along with it. We’re seeking quick court action to find out where these records might be.” Sullivan has been sympathetic towards Judicial Watch’s probe and ordered the State Department to pony up information before. But the latest moves by the FBI and State Department are getting under the skin of Republicans. Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley thinks the FBI is just ignoring the laws they’re supposed to uphold. “The FBI is behaving like it’s above the law. Simply refusing to cooperate with a court-ordered request is not an appropriate course of action. This entire case, from Secretary Clinton’s ill-advised decision to use a non-government email server, to the FBI’s investigation about classified information, needs some transparency in order to assure the American people that getting to the bottom of this controversy is a priority.” One might ask if the Justice Department would be more willing to work with the court if Vice President Joe Biden was going to run for president. Clinton has her backers, but there are people out there who truly believe Biden’s moment has come. Of course a new story seems to hit the Interwebz every day on whether Biden will or won’t hope third time’s a charm on the Democratic presidential nod. So the Justice Department, and by proxy the Obama Administration, may be waiting to find out what Biden will do before moving forward. Who knows, maybe the Justice Department is worried about what documents Clinton may or may not have and would just rather protect themselves from getting egg on their faces. That is a little conspiracy theorist, but with this Clintonemail case what isn’t? It’s right out of a conspiracy novel to have a sitting Secretary of State use her own server, let alone her own email, to do federal government business. It’s also right out of a book for her to make sure her top aides have their own private emails to do business as well. Then to have the server wiped? Well that’s just plain normal for people, right? Right? The bigger question is how long will this keep playing out? Federal courts can take a long time to get things done so unless Sullivan decides to just toss the case out (and who wouldn’t be surprised if that happened) then it could keep going through the 2016 campaign. There are also at least four other lawsuits going on regarding Clinton’s dealings in the State Department and they’re so convoluted there’s no way to consolidate them all into one without making even more of a mess. So the legal drama will keep playing out and whatever happens will happen. It’s pure entertainment that’s for sure, but whether it affects the 2016 campaign is anyone’s guess. Not to be an Eeyore here, but it probably won’t. UPDATE: Judge Emmet Sullivan is telling the State Department go get a move on and start processing Clinton’s emails faster than they have been. He ordered (link:  the State Department to get all emails from Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills in some kind of electronic system by the end of the week. “There has to be some reallocation of resources because these are atypical cases.” This didn’t go too well with the Justice Department who claimed the State Department was understaffed and overworked. Elizabeth Shapiro, a senior Justice Department lawyer handling many of the more than 30 cases seeking Clinton-related emails, said the administration is doing what it can, but said its employees are already stretched, working “really demoralizing, crushing hours.” “The State Department is being crushed with obligations,” she said… The State Department says it has the equivalent of about 63 full-time employees working on the thousands of open-records requests the department gets each year, and those staffers are being pushed to meet tight deadlines, including those imposed by more than a dozen judges now involved in some Clinton email-related cases. Ms. Shapiro said the department is also concerned that they are giving too much time and attention to cases where someone has sued, saying that ends up stiffing the other requesters who don’t have the resources to go to court. Sullivan’s answer is brilliant, ”find the resources.” One would think the government would want this to be over and done with as quickly as possible. But again, maybe the Justice and State departments are moving slow in hopes of Biden riding backwards on a white pony to save them all. ",

        "articles": "That tax day march, protest or whatever it was produced pretty much nothing in terms of results if people were expecting President Trump to suddenly serve up all of his tax returns. The standard line coming out of the Press Secretary’s office hasn’t changed one iota, stating that nobody cares about this except the media (and liberal activists) and the nation elected him without seeing them. That hasn’t stopped a number of blue states from considering new and highly dubious laws requiring candidates to provide such documentation to appear on the ballot in 2020. Those efforts will no doubt be challenged in court and we won’t know the results for quite a while. In the meantime, however, New York State is opting for a more… direct approach. They’re working on a bill which would reveal multiple years of state tax returns for any President, Vice President, governor, attorney general or senator who filed in New York. (NY Daily News) New York Democrats have hatched a plan to get a look at Donald Trump’s taxes by crafting legislation designed to get at his state returns that does everything but mention the President by name. The bill introduced in New York’s Senate and Assembly would require the state to release five years of state tax information for any President or vice president who files a New York state return. While Trump’s state return wouldn’t include all the details from his federal return, it would offer the public much more information about the Republican President’s potential conflicts of interest or how his finances would be affected by his own tax cut proposal, according to supporters. Maybe it’s just me, but this sounds pretty much insane. Keep in mind that they’re not talking about forcing Trump, Andrew Cuomo, Chuck Schumer, Kirsten Gillibrand and all the rest to turn over the forms on their own. This bill, if signed into law, would require the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance to release the returns without needing the permission of the officials in question. The problems with such a law are numerous and could easily be tied up in the courts until long after Trump is out of office. Right off the bat, this law sounds an awful lot like a Bill of Attainder. That puts it in trouble with Article I section 10 of the Constitution. The bill also appears to fly in the face of generations of rulings regarding privacy as well as existing state laws which have been on the books for ages. On their own web site under the section on audits, the NYS DoTF reminds taxpayers of the following. (Emphasis added) You have the right to know why we are requesting certain information, how we will use the information, and the consequences if you fail to submit the information. The Tax Law prohibits the disclosure of information obtained from a tax return or during the course of an audit to any unauthorized person. The Tax Law, however, does permit us to share your tax information with the IRS and other government agencies, within defined standards of secrecy and reciprocity. And finally, federal law requires confidentiality of information on federal tax returns. Right on the forms for how to complete your New York State tax returns it instructs you to copy over the same W2 information and other data on your federal tax form. All in all, it sounds like this bill should be dead on arrival. But that assumes that it arrives at all. The Democrats in the assembly cooked this up but they still don’t have control of the state senate. It would have to make it through there before Governor Cuomo had a shot at it. This looks like a tremendous waste of the legislature’s time designed only to score political points. But in a way, I’d almost like to see them pass it. The subsequent court challenges would be fascinating to observe. ",

        "articles": "Bear in mind that the starting level of any Law & Order: SVU is somewhere around dreck and self-satire anyway. I watched three weeks of episodes in Rome last October because I could only get one channel of television in English, and it tended to run the worst of American crime-drama shows — which means that LOSVU was in heavy rotation. Therefore, I wasn’t expecting much from the show, and it didn’t disappoint. By the time the viewer gets to the 10-minute mark in this episode, LOSVU has reduced the issues of GamerGate and undisclosed relationships between game creators and journalists covering the field to “just because Reina doesn’t have money, it means she doesn’t have talent.” There isn’t any mention of the conflict between social-change activists and gamers, nor of the lack of disclosure in gaming journalism that aligned with them. Instead, the male gamers are all dismissed as mindless and bloodthirsty chauvinists, or “slope-headed son[s]-of-a-bitch,” as the victim puts it. On the other hand, at least Hollywood has discovered “SWATting,” even if they managed to pick the wrong kind of gaming victim: Patrick Bissett predicted as much, based on LOSVU‘s track record: The manner in which the writers of “Law & Order” have historically incorporated social commentary into their shows is beyond appalling. They consistently misrepresent complex social issues and pander to political and intellectual lowest common denominators. There is nothing wrong with a TV drama highlighting and making accessible important social issues. It is, however, patently clear that the makers of “Law & Order” have no interest in balanced, fair commentary and are instead focused on ensuring that their treatment of moral, legal, political, and ethical issues move in lockstep with prevailing ideas. Ten years ago, an SVU episode entitled “Game” was aired in which kids who played violent video games were replicating virtual violence in real life. In the episode, detectives are puzzled by a strange homicide in which a sex worker is run over by a car and then beaten to death by the driver. (No points for guessing which video game was the subject of this particular program.) The message was clear: violence in video games causes real-life violence. It was a thesis extremely prevalent among many politicians and activists at the time, most notably Jack Thompson, but it is one that now, a decade later, is viewed with widespread disdain. Numerous studies as well as a downward trend in violent crime and a corresponding uptick in game sales have shown that the idea is pure nonsense. If NBC’s teaser is anything to go by, then the events as depicted in “Intimidation Game,” just like those depicted in “Game,” will also be completely at odds with reality. Forbes’ Erik Kain, who has covered GamerGate with remarkable balance, is flat-out appalled: Actually this SVU garbage reminds me of Reefer Madness. Like…a lot. — Erik Kain (@erikkain) February 12, 2015 I'm pretty sure a lot of girl gamers enjoy shooting things, too. They're not all pining for peaceful games without any action. — Erik Kain (@erikkain) February 12, 2015 The Darknet! Ooooooh! Also, ISIS is in this television program? I'm so CONFUSED! — Erik Kain (@erikkain) February 12, 2015 That’s in response to the hostage video that male gamers force the main victim to make and their somewhat familiar group flag. It’s not an accident that they’re connecting GamerGate with terrorism. Lazy Gamer’s Zoe Hawkins says it made her blood boil: I’ve been preparing you all for the GamerGate Law and Order episode. I still held out hope that they might make it somewhat balanced or interesting for gamers. I was obviously far too naive – they butchered gamers, gaming, and made the whole thing into a cartoon caricature of good vs evil. Yeah, it was way worse than I imagined. … I suppose it’s the nature of the show. It’s not meant to show any kind of high level debate or discussion. It’s just about pairing some cheesy plot with even cheesier writing. I just wish they could steer clear of sensitive topics if they’re going to handle them like a bull in a china shop – it doesn’t help anyone, and it isn’t even entertaining to watch. Shame on you Law & Order: SVU, and shame on you Ice-T for being involved in projects that make your fellow gamers look like a bad 90s stereotype. “DOES HE PLAY VIDEO GAMES? WHERE DOES HE PLAY?” Even apart from the hackish treatment of GamerGate, the writing on this show is amazingly bad, and not just on this episode. They managed to exceed their usual level of stupidity, right down to the first-person shooter perspective at the climax of the confrontation. Be sure to stick around to the end, though, to reach the final level of the LOSVU dungeon to hear Ice T say, “See, I know the difference between video games and reality.” That might be the least self-aware statement on television this year from Hollywood. Update: Erik Kain goes into extensive detail on just how many people LOSVU insulted with this episode: I’ve never felt so insulted after watching TV before, and not just me: the show manages to insult everybody, from the gamers it takes on to the police to women in video games and, perhaps worst of all, victims of actual sexual assault. … One thing leads to another and pretty soon SVU has uncovered a Serious Terrorist Organization of some sorts, made up of gamers who can’t tell the difference between games and reality and want both women and social justice out of gaming. Yes, we hear this sort of thing on Twitter. Social Justice Warriors are the enemies of many in the so-called #GamerGate movement. This has yet to reach ISIS levels of terrorism outside of the inflammatory tweets of some industry insiders. So these gamers kidnap a high profile female game developer, Raina Punjabi, during her game launch (for her fictional Amazonian Warriors RPG, which is a non-violent game because of course women who play games don’t like violence!) The Gamers are super high-tech. They use the “Darknet” to make sure everything they do is totally untraceable. Scary! And they post their awful videos to Redchanit which, I mean, come on people is this for real? (Alas, redchanit.com and redchanit.org are already registered. Update: By NBC last October….) Alas, DARKNET domains are also already taken — but not by NBC. Anyway, be sure to read the whole thing. ",

        "articles": "Good lord. Colorado has been solid blue for nearly two months. If that state is back on the board now, Clinton won’t be the only member of her team to faint this week. A Reuters/Ipsos survey released this week gave Trump a narrow edge in a two-way race, 43 percent to 41 percent — his first lead in Colorado in the 2016 election. It follows two other recent polls showing the presidential race as a dead heat or within 5 percentage points… “Anybody who thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the state of Colorado by double digits was dreaming,” said Ridder, a veteran of six presidential campaigns. “The history in Colorado shows that it is difficult for a Democrat or a Republican to get over 50 percent of the vote.”… Republican pollster David Flaherty at Magellan Strategies conducted a Aug. 29-31 poll that showed Clinton with a 41 percent to 36 percent lead among likely voters in a four-way race, just outside the 4.4 percentage point margin of error. But he cautions against Trump’s camp getting too optimistic. “Trump is not gaining in momentum or support. Gary Johnson is,” he said, referring to the Libertarian candidate for president, who is getting significant support in Colorado. Clinton led by 12 in one poll of Colorado in early August, then by eight in a poll taken a week later, then by five in the Magellan poll mentioned above, and now she trails by two in the latest Reuters poll. WaPo’s recent 50-state survey found her leading by two head-to-head in CO and dead even with Trump at 37 percent in the four-way race. There’s every reason to believe the state has tightened significantly. What Flaherty says about Johnson is true, too: Colorado is consistently one of his best states. He hit 15 percent in one poll taken there this month and reached 16 percent in another, then hit 16 again in the WaPo poll. There’s a strong libertarian base in CO, especially among young voters; Johnson actually topped Trump for second place among the 18-29 group in one poll of the state not long ago. If Trump pulls the upset there, it’s likely to be because Johnson is siphoning off enough young adults from Clinton to make a winning vote share for Trump in the mid-40s possible. Which is yet another reason why Trump is being foolish in not demanding that Johnson be allowed to debate. He could end up being a Nader to Hillary’s Al Gore because of his appeal to twentysomethings. If you’re Trump, whose base skews older, why wouldn’t you want him in the spotlight? As for Nevada, yep, he’s ahead there now too. That’s not as much of a shock as Colorado since NV has been close throughout the summer, but this is further evidence of a Clinton slide. She led by four in Monmouth’s last poll of the state and now trails by two. Of note: The poll was conducted from Sunday through Tuesday, which means it’s pricing in reaction to Clinton’s “deplorables” remark and her swoon over the weekend. And lo and behold, suddenly Trump’s ahead. Among Silver State voters likely to participate in November’s presidential election, 44% currently support Trump and 42% back Clinton. Another 8% intend to vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson and 3% say they will choose Nevada’s unique “none of these candidates” ballot option. Monmouth’s July poll found Clinton leading Trump by 45% to 41%, with Johnson at 5% and none of the above at 4%. Green Party candidate Jill Stein will not appear on the ballot in Nevada. Among self-identified Republicans, 88% support Trump, which is identical to his 88% support in July. Among Democrats, 90% support Clinton, which is similar to her 92% support in July. Independents have shifted, however, now giving Trump a clear 43% to 29% advantage over Clinton, with 17% supporting Johnson. Two months ago, the independent vote was divided at 39% for Trump, 37% for Clinton, and 10% for Johnson. Weirdly, although Trump’s and Clinton’s favorable numbers are similar, hers are steady while his have slipped a bit further. And yet he’s ahead narrowly now whereas she was ahead before. We’ll need more polling to have a better idea of how much of Trump’s polling improvement lately is due to the “deplorables”/fainting double whammy, but here’s what the LA Times national tracking poll looks like two days later. Pretty dramatic, no? She’s down three points since Saturday, the day after the “deplorables” comment and the day before the swoon. He’s up three points, meanwhile, and at 46.7 percent, he’s currently enjoying his best numbers since his post-convention bounce in late July. His lead of 4.7 points is also his biggest since July 29th. It seems highly likely that the next set of state and national polls taken this week, incorporating the fallout from Clinton’s rough weekend, will show better numbers for him too. Which means that Hillary had better have some solid debates. If she doesn’t, she’s going to Buckner this election. ",

        "articles": "John Kerry might be ready to move on to “a lot more important things than Benghazi,” but last week House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa cautioned the CIA to lawyer up after reports that whistleblowers are starting to come forward on the events of the fateful September evening, and on Tuesday Speaker Boehner unveiled the results of months of Congressional investigation on the terrorist attack in Libya — a new interim House report that doesn’t paint an altogether flattering picture of the Obama administration, and a certain former Secretary of State in particular: The 46-page report by the five committees of jurisdiction concludes that reductions in security levels prior to the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were approved at the highest levels of the State Department, including by Clinton herself. The report also concludes that talking points from the intelligence community were altered to protect the State Department from criticism of inadequate security levels. And from the report’s executive summary on the ongoing Congressional investigation’s several determinations to date, which “illustrate the need for continued examination and oversight by the five House Committees”: -Reductions of security levels prior to the attacks in Benghazi were approved at the highest levels of the State Department, up to and including Secretary Clinton. This fact contradicts her testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on January 23, 2013. -In the days following the attacks, White House and senior State Department officials altered accurate talking points drafted by the Intelligence Community in order to protect the State Department. -Contrary to Administration rhetoric, the talking points were not edited to protect classified information. Concern for classified information is never mentioned in email traffic among senior Administration officials. We can all guess what kind of backlash is going to come from this report, yeah? That Hillary Clinton already accepted the blame for Benghazi (à la, the-buck-stops-with-me-but-not–really), and that this is just Republicans’ pathetic attempt to keep dragging out and politicizing an issue in order to irk the Obama administration and put a dent in Hillary’s reputation in front of 2016, which is just silly anyways, ’cause let’s face it — she’s Hillary, and you Can’t Touch This. Who really cares that finally getting to the bottom of the Benghazi attacks would be the accountable and righteous thing to do, and “what difference does it make,” anyways? You Republicans should probably stop embarrassing yourselves and drop the whole thing, The End. The problem there, however, is that there’s a chance Hillary’s political cred isn’t the unassailable fortress of awesome that some might presume, especially if the “highest levels of the state department,” cough cough, were willfully negligent about providing adequate security to the consulate: After the U.S.-backed Libyan revolution ended the Gadhafi regime, the U.S. government did not deploy sufficient U.S. security elements to protect U.S. interests and personnel that remained on the ground. Senior State Department officials knew that the threat environment in Benghazi was high and that the Benghazi compound was vulnerable and unable to withstand an attack, yet the department continued to systematically withdraw security personnel. Repeated requests for additional security were denied at the highest levels of the State Department. For example, an April 2012 State Department cable bearing Secretary Hillary Clinton’s signature acknowledged then-Ambassador Cretz’s formal request for additional security assets but ordered the withdrawal of security elements to proceed as planned. And the report goes on to fault President Obama’s administration for perpetuating “a deliberately misleading and incomplete narrative that the violence grew out of a demonstration caused by a YouTube video. The Administration consciously decided not to discuss extremist involvement or previous attacks against Western interests in Benghazi.” Shots, fired. No response from White House or State yet. ",

        "articles": "Via Red State, not a huge deal but worth flagging in case there’s another poll this weekend showing his numbers dipping a bit in New York on the eve of the primary. That would suggest a trend, and that would be a big deal given what’s at stake. To be clear: Trump’s going to romp in NY on Tuesday night, winning by 25 points or better, and will pick up something like 75 delegates even in a worst-case scenario. But since his path to 1,237 is so difficult, it matters a lot whether he ends up with 75 in New York or 95, which is what he’d get if he sweeps the state. Every delegate he leaves on the table now will have to be made up for later; finishing with 75 in New York means he’ll likely need to find another 10-20 somewhere in California on June 7th, where he won’t have home-field advantage. The reason this poll is significant (apart from the enormous 14,000-person sample size) is that 50 percent is a magic number in New York. If you hit 50 statewide, you get all 11 of the state’s at-large delegates. If you don’t, the second-place finisher gets some of them proportionally. More importantly, if you hit 50 percent in a congressional district, you get all three of that district’s delegates. If you don’t, you get two delegates and the second-place finisher gets one. There are 27 congressional districts, meaning that the difference between Trump hitting 49 percent in every district and hitting 50 there is … 27 delegates. That’s a big haul and potentially crucial to his ability to reach 1,237. (To put it in perspective, Cruz’s prize for sweeping Colorado’s delegate elections was 37 delegates.) So when a poll drops showing him at 49 percent statewide, we sit up and pay attention. The margins matter on Tuesday night. A lot. If we direct our attention to the figure above, we can see that statewide he is also polling at 49%, so whether he’s able to take the statewide delegates by “winner-take-all” rules outright is up in the air. The even better news for Trump is that he’s hitting the 50% threshold in 11/27 districts and is within three percentage points of six more (see figure below). Just by keeping 50% in those 11 districts and a plurality in the others, Trump would get 65 delegates… Further, if we look at shifts between the opinion shares we observed this week (4.11-4.13) and compare them to our last poll (3.22-3.24), we don’t see monumental moves against Trump across numerous districts (see figure below). We do note a generally favorable Kasich trend of between 2 and 6 points in most districts. While this is generally good, these shifts are unlikely to change the order of results, and thus unlikely to shift all-important delegate totals on Election Day. In other words, while we believe Kasich appears to be making some progress in many districts, it is not enough to change delegate totals significantly. If Trump were to finish below 50 percent in 16 districts, that’s 16 delegates going to Kasich or Cruz (assuming the second-place finisher gets at least 20 percent of the vote, which seems inevitable in a three-way race). That’s … not a great outcome for Trump. If he also finishes below 50 statewide, that would cost him another four delegates by Phil Kerpen’s estimation. The last survey by this pollster, Optimus, taken three weeks ago had him winning 15 of New York’s 27 districts with an outright majority, meaning that he’s actually slipped a bit this month. A few days ago, Nate Silver published a state-by-state roadmap to the rest of the primaries and estimated that Trump needs 91 delegates from New York to stay on the path to 1,237. Silver’s more conservative projections of how he might do there put him in the low 80s. Optimus’s new data has him in the mid 70s. If there’s such a thing as having a “bad night” when you win a big state primary by crushing your opponents, that’s what it would look like. But look: How likely is it, realistically, that Trump’s going to fall short in New York on Tuesday? Optimus found 14 percent still undecided in this poll. Among that 14 percent, 17 percent are already leaning Trump — more than are leaning Kasich or Cruz — and another 59 percent are still making up their minds. There’s every reason to think the bulk of them will end up tilting towards the native son who’s on TV 24/7. His average in NY at RCP over the last few weeks is 53.4 percent, with one recent poll putting him at 56 percent and another placing him at 60(!). There’s every reason to think he’ll crack 50 statewide and plenty of reason, I think, to believe that he’ll easily pull 50 in a majority of New York’s districts. If we’re being real, there are probably eight to 10 districts where there’s some suspense about the outcome, and the only suspense is whether Trump will win them with a plurality or majority. If his realistic worst-case scenario is, say, 88 delegates, then he’s basically still where he needs to be to clinch. Here’s video of Ted Cruz speaking last night at the New York City GOP gala and finding himself roundly ignored, presumably because of his crack months ago about “New York values.” Trump can stand onstage at a national debate and smirkingly assure the country that he’ll issue illegal orders to the military and still be applauded by his local GOP, but God forbid you insult their parochial community pride.

        "articles": "The latest Washington Post-ABC News poll will be setting the narrative for the rest of the day, and that narrative is not an especially good one for Republicans. While Americans are not happy with the president’s approach to the border crisis, this poll suggests that the public is even less happy with Republicans and want the GOP to pass the president’s $3.7 billion supplemental package to deal with the situation on the southern border immediately. Overall, 33 percent of respondents said they approve of the president’s handling of the humanitarian disaster on the border while 58 percent disapprove. Those are terrible numbers, but they look better in comparison to congressional Republicans. Of congressional Republicans, 66 percent disapprove of their handling of the border crisis while only 23 percent approve. A majority, 53 percent, support Obama’s proposed emergency spending package billed as being designed to “provide care for these children while their deportation cases are heard” and “speed their deportation hearings and to increase border security.” It looks like the GOP is in a terrible position from these topline results. Why the pollster even thought to ask respondents about how the Republicans in Congress are handling the border crisis is a mystery if not for a desire to contrast the president against a more unpopular foil. A glance at the data, however, suggests that the president’s approach to the border crisis is in a far worse position with the American public. Republicans in Congress, who receive poor marks from nearly two-thirds of the public, can attribute some of that antipathy to their own voters. “Almost as many Republicans disapprove of their party’s handling of the issue as say they approve, with negative ratings rising to a majority among conservatives,” reads The Post’s write up of the poll. 48 percent approve of the GOP’s approach to the crisis while 45 percent disapprove. Only 22 percent of independents and 9 percent of Democrats approve of the GOP’s approach to the crisis. The president, meanwhile, maintains the support of 57 percent of Democrats who approve of his approach to the border crisis. 12 percent of Republicans and 28 percent of independents agree. If the GOP maintained the intraparty unity that Obama benefits from, their numbers would look similar to the president’s. More interestingly, support for Obama’s handling of the crisis across racial demographics is shockingly weak. Only 27 percent of whites support his approach compared to 66 percent who oppose it. Just 55 percent of African-Americans back the president’s approach to this crisis – an unusually low finding for a demographic whose approval of the president Gallup currently pegs at 84 percent. Finally, a majority of Latinos – 54 percent – disapprove of Obama’s handling of the border crisis. Only 40 percent support his approach. As for the support of the supplemental package, it is unclear why anyone would oppose it based on both the wording of the proposal put to voters in this survey and the absence of an alternative. Without a counter proposal, the fact that throwing money at a problem – money aimed at providing medical care to needy children, no less – only received 53 percent support is striking. But digging into the numbers here is also instructive. Among registered voters, as opposed to all adults, 2 percentage points shifts from support to opposition (51/45). Two-thirds of self-described Democrats support the proposal along with 51 percent of independents. 35 percent of self-identified Republicans back the proposal. The most opposition to the plan comes from those who identify as “conservative Republican.” Among this group, only 29 percent support the supplemental package while 66 percent oppose it. In a crisis, and the situation at the border is a crisis, a plan always beats no plan. Right now, while it is imperfect and many do not trust that the federal government will carry out the deportation of the majority of the unaccompanied migrant children at the conclusion of their expedited deportation hearings, the proposed supplemental package remains the only option on the table to deal with an acute catastrophe. Why this pollster decided to gauge the nation’s opinion of how congressional Republicans have handled this situation, I have no idea. Beyond the fact that it serves to conveniently remind the public that the GOP is, as ever, more unpopular than Obama – a refrain you will hear for the rest of the day. ",

        "articles": "One year ago, Illinois was forced by the courts to allow the issuance of concealed carry permits over the great objections of anti-gun rights groups. We were warned that there would be “blood in the streets” and carnage unbound. After twelve months of this horrid state of affairs, the police in the Land of Lincoln report that the event has turned out to be pretty much a big nothing-burger. “For us, it’s been a non-event,” said Joe Gallo, deputy chief with Champaign police, echoing a similar sentiment as law-enforcement officials in other area counties. When Illinois became the last state to enact concealed-carry in January, after the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down its long-time ban, police expressed concerns about safety. One of their biggest fears: police interactions with licensed gun carriers during traffic stops. Champaign County Sheriff Dan Walsh said deputies made one DUI arrest of a concealed-carry permit holder in 2014. The driver was completely cooperative, he said. Walsh said he told his deputies when the law went into effect to let him know if they ran into any problems. “I’ve yet to get one,” he said. As Bob Owens notes, legal concealed carriers are probably about the last people that the cops need to worry about. Concealed carriers in most states are required to undergo a through background check before getting a concealed carry permit, and many states require concealed carriers to undergo a certain number of hours of training focused on the law and legal theory of armed self-defense as well. Many states also require a shooting test to show (very basic) competency with a handgun on static targets at a short fixed range. Curiously, there seems to be little to no difference in the percentage of negligent or criminal shootings by concealed carriers in states with absolutely not permitting process required (typically referred to as “constitutional carry”) and those states that have more restrictive standards (like Illinois), suggesting that the state-mandated courses might not have an significant effect of any sort, other than to create a cost and procedural barrier to lawful carry. Supporters of the Second Amendment may well look at this story and say, so what? This was about as predictable as the sun coming up in the East. But in a way, that’s what makes it such an important story, and one which deserves more coverage in the mainstream press than it will receive. It speaks to the wider question of laws mandating gun rights restrictions in general in an important way. Gun control laws don’t impact anyone who is already predisposed to break the law. Passing one more layer of restrictions isn’t going to prevent a gang member from using a weapon in a crime. There aren’t any Bloods or Crips out there thinking, Gee, I’d really like to murder Bill for cutting into my crack sales territory, but I can’t risk the fine for having an unlicensed gun. When you place burdensome restrictions on gun ownership, you are only limiting the rights of those who don’t wish to break the law. And as Illinois has now shown, when you allow for legal, concealed carry, all you produce is more law abiding citizens who receive training on safe, proper weapon use and the laws which apply to it. Sadly, I doubt this will make the chyron at CNN any time soon. Stories like this simply don’t fit the narrative. ",

        "articles": "I’m pretty sure this is the New Civility in action, right? David Plouffe was one of the chief architects of Hope and Change, where naked partisanship would give way to Team Obama’s sense of cool leadership, where the bitterness of the past would be eclipsed by pragmatic, ideology-free competence. More than four years in, how close has Barack Obama and Plouffe come? Oh, who are we kidding? This is pure Chicago sur le Potomac. Appreciate it for what it is: President Barack Obama’s senior White House adviser and former campaign manager David Plouffe accused House Republicans of “committing economic treason” during the partial government shutdown on Thursday. In a snarky tweet about Republicans’ attempts to negotiate an end to the government shutdown, Plouffe dredged up the “birther” issue in order to discredit the GOP:  If nothing else, consider this a measuring stick of White House desperation. With Obama’s popularity unexpectedly dropping like a rock (along with the GOP’s), obviously it’s no longer enough to call Republicans obstructionists, hostage takers, and terrorists — while adamantly declaring that the President shouldn’t have to negotiate until his opponents give up all their legitimate political leverage. Plouffe and Obama’s team now need to escalate a fight over deficits to Benedict Arnold levels, along with the now-laughable gripe about the birthers that the White House likes far more than Republicans do, for just this purpose. This is a perfect time to include an interview conducted by our great friend Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday with CNN’s Jake Tapper, via Mediate. Tapper tries to steer clear of political conclusions, but pointedly notes that he’s not hearing any terrorist/hostage-taker/traitor rhetoric coming from Republicans: “Do you think the President and the Democrats’ rhetoric is qualitatively different than the Speaker and the Republicans’ rhetoric?” Hewitt asked. Tapper’s response: “Well, I haven’t heard the Republicans, we’re just talking about insults now, not anything else. I haven’t heard Republicans comparing the Democrats to suicide bombers or to kidnappers or to arsonists. But it’s possible that I’m not paying close enough attention.” … Ultimately, he said, “none of it is helpful,” especially after the president’s senior adviser Dan Pfeifferwent on CNN and perform the “hat trick of comparing the Republicans to suicide bombers, arsonists and kidnappers all in one interview.” Just in case you’re not keeping score, Investors Business Daily is: Remember when President Obama was showered with kudos for his 2011 speech calling for “more civility in our public discourse”?… [A]s a sample of his recent words used to attack Republicans proves, he hasn’t followed his own advice: • “Putting a gun to the American people’s head.” • “One party in Congress might blow the whole thing up if they don’t get their way.” • “Extortion.” • “Demand ransom.” • “Burn down your house.” • “Hold people hostage or engage in ransom-taking to get a hundred percent of your way.” … On CNN last week, moreover, senior Obama aide Dan Pfeiffer called Republicans “people with a bomb strapped to their chest.” Yet at the Tuesday press conference, Obama actually quipped that “what the American people, I think, expect is just civility.” Maybe it should start with you, Mr. President.

        "articles": "It started out with such high hopes: “I will sign a universal health care bill into law by the end of my first term as president that will cover every American and cut the cost of a typical family’s premium by up to $2,500 a year.” That was on the trail in 2008, an audacious promise Politifact ruled flatly “Broken.” Obama repeated the promises of lower premiums and bent cost curves as a central part of his pitch in passing the health care law. It is called “The Affordable Care Act.” But most supporters of Obamacare have stopped talking about cost savings and started focusing on increased benefits, acknowledging (sometimes explicitly and sometimes implicitly) that expanded coverage and more benefits will actually cost more money, not less, but that the trade-off is worth it. President Obama joined that crowd in his second Inaugural address Monday. It came as Obama just barely grazed two issues rather important to the American people at the end of this paragraph: We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time. So we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work hard or learn more, reach higher. But while the means will change, our purpose endures. A nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American, that is what this moment requires. That is what will give real meaning to our creed. We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. And, now for the “but,” clause, which includes all the reasons he can’t actually ever make hard choices: But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future. President Obama spent two years of his first term passing a giant health care bill that was supposed to address rising costs. This claim was front and center in his appeal to a joint session of Congress on the matter in 2009: Then there’s the problem of rising costs. We spend one-and-a-half times more per person on health care than any other country, but we aren’t any healthier for it. This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages. It’s why so many employers – especially small businesses – are forcing their employees to pay more for insurance, or are dropping their coverage entirely. It’s why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first place, and why American businesses that compete internationally – like our automakers – are at a huge disadvantage. And it’s why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it – about $1000 per year that pays for somebody else’s emergency room and charitable care. Finally, our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers. When health care costs grow at the rate they have, it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs, we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined. Put simply, our health care problem is our deficit problem. Nothing else even comes close. These are the facts. Nobody disputes them. We know we must reform this system. And, so we did, allegedly with an eye toward “bending the cost curve down” and lowering premiums for families. It has been more than two years since the law passed. Critics of the law have been proven right again and again in their skepticism that it could do those things. HHS, 2010: President Obama’s health care overhaul law will increase the nation’s health care tab instead of bringing costs down, government economic forecasters concluded Thursday in a sobering assessment of the sweeping legislation. A report by economic experts at the Health and Human Services Department said the health care remake will achieve Obama’s aim of expanding health insurance — adding 34 million Americans to the coverage rolls. But the analysis also found that the law falls short of the president’s twin goal of controlling runaway costs. It also warned that Medicare cuts may be unrealistic and unsustainable, driving about 15% of hospitals into the red and “possibly jeopardizing access” to care for seniors. The mixed verdict for Obama’s signature issue is the first comprehensive look by neutral experts. Kaiser, 2011: The Kaiser Family Foundation shows family premiums topped $15,000 a year for the first time in 2011, increasing a whopping 9% this year, three times more than the increase the year before. The study says that up to 2% of that increase is because of the health care law’s provisions, such as allowing families to add grown children up to 26 years old to their policies. CLASS Act turns out to be fiction, not revenue, 2011: How did a program so obviously unsustainable that the White House had no choice but to shut it down produce an $80 billion surplus for ObamaCare accounting purposes? Very simply, actually. The Democrats designed the first five years of CLASS to be a “vesting period” in which enrollees would pay into the program but receive no benefits yet. In other words, for the first five years, the program would have been pure profit for the government — and then, when benefits finally kicked in, the hemorrhaging would begin. The reason they did it that way is the same reason they delayed the start of ObamaCare until 2014: They knew that CBO “scores” new legislation based on its first 10 years of operation, so the more they could game the numbers during those first 10 years, the better the “score” for ObamaCare would look while Democrats were trying to sell it to the public. It was a massive accounting fraud designed to make health-care reform seem much less expensive than it really was. According to Klein, CLASS’s phony “savings” accounted for fully $70 billion of ObamaCare’s supposed $143 billion in deficit reduction. The 1099 reporting rule turns out to be overburdensome regulation, not revenue, 2011: The very first part of ObamaCare to get the knife was the 1099 reporting requirement. That extremist bit of legislation passed the Senate 87-12 and the House, 314-112, and landed on the President’s desk for signing on April 14. The 1099 reporting requirement was one of the funding fictions ObamaCare supporters used to make it look as if the President’s plan would fulfill his promise not to “add a dime to the deficit.” Post-passage it was almost universally recognized as unworkable. It would have required businesses to fill out an IRS form (1099) for every $600 of staples and printer paper they bought at Target within a calendar year. It closed a loophole, and that loophole was shopping. When it was repealed, Obama called it “a big win for small business.” Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2012: When President Obama began pushing national health care legislation in 2009, he argued that reform was needed to rein in the unsustainable growth in health care spending that was crippling the budgets of businesses, states and the federal government. But a new government actuarial study finds that as a result of the law, health care spending will be $478 billion higher over the next decade than it would have otherwise been had no law been passed. Furthermore, as a result of the health care law, about 50 cents of every dollar of health care spending in the United States will be financed by government by 2021, according to the report from the actuary’s office at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, unveiled today in the journal Health Affairs. Then there’s the $63 Obamacare’s newly written regulations added to everyone’s premium in December, which even if it were the only increase for which Obamacare was responsible, would still put Obama $2,563 off his promise. The charge, buried in a recent regulation, works out to tens of millions of dollars for the largest companies, employers say. Most of that is likely to be passed on to workers. Oops, electronic records raise costs instead of lowering them, 2013: The report predicted that widespread use of electronic records could save the United States health care system at least $81 billion a year, a figure RAND now says was overstated. The study was widely praised within the technology industry and helped persuade Congress and the Obama administration to authorize billions of dollars in federal stimulus money in 2009 to help hospitals and doctors pay for the installation of electronic records systems. “RAND got a lot of attention and a lot of buzz with the original analysis,” said Dr. Kellermann, who was not involved in the 2005 study. “The industry quickly embraced it.” But evidence of significant savings is scant, and there is increasing concern that electronic records have actually added to costs by making it easier to bill more for some services. Politico discovers mandates of more benefits and more coverage paid for with more taxes might hike premium costs, 2013: If you work for a small business, your next health insurance premium may give you sticker shock. Many of the small-business and individual insurance policies are working the health reform law’s 2014 fees into their 2013 bills, contributing to double-digit premium increases for some people. All those new consumer benefits packed into the health reform law — birth control without a co-pay, free preventive care and limits on when insurers can turn down a customer — had to be paid for somehow. So the law’s drafters included a new tax on health insurers, starting at $8 billion in 2014 and increasing to $14 billion within four years, to help meet the new expenses. And insurers in 2014 will also have to pay a “reinsurance contribution” to cushion health plans that end up with a lot of sick customers under new rules requiring them to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The Government Accountability Office, 2013: The Government Accountability Office (GAO)’s annual audit of the government, released Thursday, raises serious concerns about the federal government’s long-term financial stability and the effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act’s cost-curbing measures. The report found “that—absent policy changes—the federal government continues to face an unsustainable fiscal path.” Obamacare has already failed in its promises. Our president spent two years, during the worst economic downturn since the Depression, passing a law more than 50 percent of the public still hates because 85 percent of them were satisfied with their current coverage, imperfect though it was. He turned the crayon box upside down to draw a picture no one wanted and we all must now pay more money to enjoy his vision. The only spending problem he’ll concede we have has been exacerbated by his own signature “achievement.” These are the facts. Nobody disputes them. Not even Obama. ",

        "articles": "What a curious strategy for a third-party candidate who knows full well that his ticket is drawing more from Clinton’s voters, especially young left-leaning voters, than from Trump’s. That being so, logic dictates that you should maximize your vote share by attacking her, not him. Calling Trump a unique evil who must be stopped could backfire by convincing millennials who are leaning towards Johnson to reconsider and vote for Clinton inste— Oh. Ohhhhh. This is the same Bill Weld, of course, who said five days ago that no one is more qualified to be president than Hillary Clinton, a candidate leading a rival party. The Libertarian vice presidential candidate, William F. Weld, said Tuesday that he plans to focus exclusively on blasting Donald Trump over the next five weeks, a strategic pivot aimed at denying Trump the White House and giving himself a key role in helping to rebuild the GOP… While Weld insisted he still supports Johnson, he said he is now interested primarily in blocking Trump from winning the presidency and then potentially working with longtime Republican leaders such as Mitt Romney and Haley Barbour to create a new path for the party after the election… Weld, a former Republican governor of Massachusetts, said he is focusing on Trump because, while he disagrees with Hillary Clinton on fiscal and military issues, Trump’s agenda is so objectionable it’s “in a class by itself.”… At one point, Weld strategists researched Libertarian Party rules to see if it were possible for him to take over the top of the ticket. The rules state the vice presidential nominee automatically assumes the presidential spot if there is a vacancy. But Johnson, peeved at the suggestion, flatly rejected the idea. When asked if he was thinking of leaving the Libertarian Party, Weld told the Globe that he wouldn’t do so … this year. Next year? Who knows. That’s not surprising given that he’s always been a centrist Massachusetts Republican, not a libertarian, and won the VP nomination at the convention this year by the barest margin only because he was Johnson’s handpicked running mate. What is surprising, given Weld’s LINO status, is that he would have broached the idea of replacing Johnson at the top of the ballot. If he’s not invested in libertarianism, why would he want to lead the ticket? Even odder, Weld could be more salable to voters in both parties who hate their respective nominees but find Johnson too kooky to get comfortable with. He might have expanded the Libertarian Party’s vote share this year as nominee, but only at the price of sacrificing the libertarian brand — and if he had expanded it, he might have inadvertently enabled a Trump victory by peeling off more votes from Clinton than from Trump. But maybe Weld thinks he wouldn’t have done better than Johnson as nominee, and that’s why he wanted to replace him. Weld the centrist moderate might have been a bust with younger voters and not quite interesting enough to disaffected older voters to get them to desert Trump or Clinton. If so, that would probably be a net gain for Clinton as millennials unimpressed with Weld gradually drifted back into her column. In other words, Weld might have become interested in supplanting Johnson once Johnson began to draw enough support from Clinton in swing states like Colorado to make the possibility of a Trump victory real. The mutiny wasn’t considered in the interest of righting the Libertarian ship but of sinking it. And if Weld as nominee did begin to catch on with voters, it seems more likely that he’d catch on with anti-Trump Republicans who were looking for a “sane” version of the party than far-left Berniebros who want some sort of radical alternative to Clinton. What’s the point of voting for centrist Bill Weld, young progressives might have asked, when they could vote for a centrist from their own party? If that’s true, that Weld heading the ticket would have hurt Trump more than Clinton, then the insurrection against Johnson would fit snugly into his “anyone but Trump” approach. The Globe says he’s planning to travel to a handful of red states and New Hampshire to make the case against Trump, but if he’s really intent on helping Hillary, he’ll end up in battlegrounds like Colorado and Pennsylvania. We’ll see. Incidentally, I’m highly amused at the thought of Weld joining forces with Mitt Romney and Haley Barbour to try to “create a new path” towards centrism and moderation for a party that now largely consists of reactionaries and nationalists plus a sizable rump conservative minority. Does this guy really not understand how we’ve arrived at this point? He’d be better off trying to build a center-right third party, which of course would only have the effect of helping Democrats win elections if it caught on him. But Weld seems pretty comfortable with that. ",

        "articles": "Democrats and the White House warn that a government shutdown over the budget impasse and the fight over ObamaCare will damage the economy. Those on the front lines of the economy seem ready to make that sacrifice, at least for a while. According to a poll last week from Pepperdine University, 48% of small-business owners back a government shutdown — some for as long as three months: Down to the final days of the nation’s current spending plan, with negotiations over a new one at a standstill, nearly half of small business owners are in favor of shutting the government down, according to a new poll. Researchers at Pepperdine University’s Graziadio School of Business and Management conducted the survey, which found that 48 percent of business owners support at least a temporary government shutdown, compared to 42 percent who say policymakers should hurry up and strike a deal. Of the poll’s 1,387 respondents, more than 90 percent own businesses with no more than 200 workers. Half of respondents said they could get behind a shutdown for up to a month, and nearly a third would support shuttering the government for up to three months. Beyond that, three in four business owners worry their firms would start to be affected by the closure, and nearly all believe the economy would start to suffer. Among employers with less than $5 million in annual revenue, 41 percent said a shutdown of more three months would force them to pull back on their hiring plans. Jazz mentioned this yesterday, but a short shutdown of a few days while the House and Senate haggle probably won’t mean much, either politically or economically. The poll bears that out. Almost nine in ten of respondents think that a shutdown of a single day will either have no impact (69%) or only a slightly negative impact (17%). After a week, that shifts to 44% and 29%, respectively, but still three-quarters thinking a shutdown will have a negligible impact on the economy, and at two weeks it’s 27% and 32%. At one month, though, it drops to 13% and 27%. On the other hand, a longer period won’t result in job losses right away. It takes 2 months to get out to 20% of respondents considering staff reductions. Even at 6 or more months, only 39% of small businesses believe a government shutdown would force them to lay off employees — although for companies of $100 million in revenue or more, the 50% mark comes at 5 months. Republicans have to be cheered by this finding, too: What do small businesses want? According to the charts, 63% want a one-year delay in ObamaCare’s implementation, while only 27% want it to go into effect tomorrow as scheduled. Forty-seven percent want full repeal, while another 27% want revisions, for an overall opposition of 74%. Sixty percent expect the law to force health care costs to rise, while only 11% believe those costs will go down. Fifty-eight percent expect to reduce their benefits package, 49% expect to reduce bonuses, and 47% plan to pull back on future hiring as a result. Small wonder they don’t mind a shutdown. ",

        "articles": "Hey, maybe delegitimization is a problem for the Supreme Court after all — even if not in the way liberal critics predicted before Thursday’s ruling to uphold ObamaCare. A new poll by Rasmussen shows a big jump in negative perceptions of the court after the decision: Public opinion of the Supreme Court has grown more negative since the highly publicized ruling on the president’s health care law was released. A growing number now believe that the high court is too liberal and that justices pursue their own agenda rather than acting impartially. A week ago, 36% said the court was doing a good or an excellent job. That’s down to 33% today. However, the big change is a rise in negative perceptions. Today, 28% say the Supreme Court is doing a poor job. That’s up 11 points over the past week. … Thirty-seven percent (37%) now believe the Supreme Court is too liberal, while 22% think it’s too conservative. A week ago, public opinion was much more evenly divided: 32% said it was too liberal and 25% said too conservative. In the latest survey, 31% now believe the balance is about right. Prior to the decision, liberal commentators and politicians warned that the court’s legitimacy could be fatally undermined if it overturned ObamaCare. It looks as though the opposite turned out to be true, although it’s likely a relatively temporary phenomenon. Republicans shifted from significantly positive (42% good or excellent, 14% poor) to strongly negative (20/43). Democrats moved from 35/22 to 50/11. (I guess they didn’t get the memo about Roberts’ Commerce Clause limitations, eh?) As always, the key is the perception of the court by independents, and that noticeably worsened, going from 31/14 to 31/30. Will this matter? Not directly, no, because Supreme Court justices don’t have to stand for election. However, the erosion in support for the court gives Mitt Romney and Republican candidates for the Senate new ammunition to use in this election cycle. The Court always matters in presidential elections, especially for conservatives, but the big issues of jobs and the economy had put them on the back burner. Jobs and the economy will still be the most important issues in this election, but the decision on Thursday makes Supreme Court appointments and confirmations much more relevant than earlier, and that will play well for Romney among the Tea Party activist base, which had been diffident at best toward Romney until now. The rising unhappiness among independents doesn’t bode well for Obama, either. For the moment, though, the decision doesn’t appear to have impacted the presidential race. Rasmussen’s latest presidential tracking poll shows a 45/45 dead heat, exactly as it was the previous day. Still, Romney may have good news on the way: Today’s results are the same as they were just before the Supreme Court ruled on the health care law. See tracking history. However, intensity is up among conservatives. On Thursday morning, 43% of conservative voters were following the presidential race on a daily basis. That’s up to 51% today. It remains to be seen whether this is a lasting change, statistical noise, or a temporary response to the health care ruling. Just 28% of moderates and 31% of liberals are following the race that closely. Those numbers are little changed since the Supreme Court ruling. Interest in a campaign is typically a good early indicator of voter turnout. It’s still early in the general-election campaign, too. Most people won’t start tuning in until the conventions, which start on August 27th with the Republican convention in Tampa. However, people questioned Romney’s ability to generate conservative intensity in this race — and at least for now, he seems to be succeeding, perhaps with a big boost from the Supreme Court. ",

        "articles": "Goooood politics. I’m 90 percent sure it won’t pass, but last week I would have told you I was 100 percent sure. At the rate O and his boondoggle are melting down on the Hill, there’s no down side to trying to force Democrats to vote on all sorts of bills that would chip away at parts of O-Care. Worst-case scenario: They fail but with some Democratic support, which means a rolling PR disaster for the White House and a very small margin of error going forward lest the Democratic turncoats in Congress start thinking maybe it’d be better to repeal this thing and be done with it. How about it, Mary Landrieu? Yes or no to tossing billions in hard-earned tax money at insurers to clean up the gigantic mess you, they, and Obama have made? Obamacare includes a provision that allows the federal government to funnel taxpayer dollars to insurers that face the prospect of losing too much money under the new health care law, and conservative critics want to repeal it. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the provision could amount to a bailout of the insurance industry, which stands to lose if the troubled Obamacare exchanges fail to enroll enough people to make the system financially viable. Obamacare enrollment has already been stymied by glitches at the healthcare.gov sign-up site and it could be dampened again under an administrative fix President Obama proposed this week to resolve problems with millions of cancelled policies… “We need to protect taxpayers from having to bail out anyone as a consequence of Obamacare,” Conant said in an email exchange with the Washington Examiner. “Rubio’s bill will fully repeal the ‘risk corridor’ provision in Obamacare, preventing a bailout.” If you’re unfamiliar with the “risk corridor,” read David Freddoso’s short but useful explainer from last month. Nutshell version: An insurer who’s offering a plan on the ObamaCare exchange sends a cost projection for that plan to HHS. If it comes in a bit under cost, they cut a check to HHS for the difference; if it comes in a bit over cost, HHS cuts them a check to make up the shortfall. It’s a way for insurers to spread the risk of cost miscalculations among themselves. Adrianna McIntyre, the economist who inspired Freddoso’s post, calls it “insurance for the insurers.” So far, so good. Problem is, there’s no cap on losses that HHS might be forced to cover if lots and lots of individual plans end up costing way more than the insurers projected. If a plan’s actual cost exceeds 103 percent of the projection, Uncle Sam covers half of the overrun; if actual cost exceeds 108 percent of the projection, Uncle Sam covers 80 percent. If ObamaCare was working perfectly, the risk of many plans coming in way over budget would be small. Healthy people would be enrolling by the millions on Healthcare.gov, flooding insurers with tons of new revenue they could use to pay for sick people’s preexisting conditions. Thanks to President Bumblefark’s incompetence, though, Healthcare.gov is a smoking ruin; young healthy people can’t sign up, which means no cash for insurance companies to cover their hefty new expenses. That leaves Uncle Sam partially on the hook for the difference. The punchline, though, is that Obama’s “fix” yesterday only makes it worse. If insurers bring back the old, cheap plans, all of the healthy people who’ve had their coverage dropped and who are supposed to provide new revenue by buying the more expensive exchange plans will revert to their old coverage. That’ll leave the exchange plans with even more sick enrollees and fewer healthies, compounding insurers’ losses. Uncle Sam’s on the hook for even more now. Via the Weekly Standard, here’s David Cutler, one of the architects of O-Care, admitting last night that an insurance industry death spiral isn’t out of the question here. In fact, though, the “risk corridor” is designed to reduce the risk of a death spiral; so are the taxpayer subsidies for lower-income enrollees on the exchanges, which can (at least theoretically) be increased to keep pace with premiums if/when they start to rise. Without the risk corridor and the subsidies, the only way for insurers to make back their losses this year is to jack up premiums next year, which will further discourage healthy people from enrolling, which in turn will make the exchange risk pools even sicker and more costly, and thus the death spiral is set in motion. Thanks to Uncle Sam’s “generosity,” they might not have to do that. But all of this points to the same basic fact: The more adverse selection there is on the new exchanges, the more unanticipated costs there’ll be. Those costs will be borne either by the insurance industry, if Rubio’s bill prevails and the “risk corridor” provision is eliminated, or mostly by the federal government, in the form of a bailout and higher subsidies. The political challenge of Rubio’s bill for Democrats is that they don’t want to be on the wrong side of yet another TARP-like government giveaway to an unpopular industry, but on the other hand they can’t take away insurers’ “risk corridor” safety net or else the industry might turn on ObamaCare and then the whole thing will implode. Dilemmas, dilemmas. ",

        "articles": "It’s become something of a cliche this year to say that Senator Jon Tester (D-Montana) is in trouble. He’s been at or near the top of everyone’s list of Dem senators ripe for having his seat flipped. Donald Trump carried Montana by 20 points in 2016 and there has been no appreciable “blue wave” in evidence in Big Sky Country since then. Tester has done an admirable job of portraying himself as a Blue Dog in two election cycles, swerving far enough toward the middle to attract sufficient Republican and independent votes to win two terms, but the times have been changing. And now, already nervous about his prospects, Tester is facing yet another obstacle, this time from his left flank. The Green Party gathered enough signatures to get on the ballot this year and they’re hosting a primary with some solid candidates. This could siphon off enough votes to put Tester out of the running. (Keep in mind that Tester didn’t manage to get 50% of the vote in either of his victories.) So what are the Democrats going to do about it? They’re suing to throw the Green Party off the ballot. (Washington Times) Sen. Jon Tester of Montana was already facing a tough re-election battle in a state that Donald Trump won by a landslide — and then the Green Party made the Democrat’s job that much tougher by qualifying for the ballot. Now the Montana Democratic Party is scrambling to oust the Greens. It has asked a judge to decertify the left-wing party by declaring 180 petition signatures invalid for reasons such as bad handwriting, use of initials instead of full names and failure to write in cursive. The lawsuit, filed April, 2 has the Greens seeing red. They accuse state Democrats of trying to disenfranchise voters in a politically motivated attack. “They’re scared,” said Danielle Breck, Montana Green Party coordinator. “There seems to be this belief that we’re going to spoil the race, particularly [for] Jon Tester. His seat is at risk, and they’re afraid we’re going to siphon votes from them.” This isn’t the Green Party you’re used to seeing in other races. They’ve recruited some serious candidates for their primary, including Steve Kelly, a former Democratic nominee for the state’s sole House seat. And that’s where the real problem for Tester and the state Democratic party is coming from. The Greens are attracting a lot of liberal Democrats who are tired of running a Blue Dog and want somebody more in the Bernie Sanders mold. Kelly even released a statement reminding everyone that Sanders carried Montana in the 2016 Democratic primary. When you’re in a position like Tester’s, squeaking by with plurality wins, you pretty much need every Democratic vote out there plus some Republicans and independents to pull off a win. If a Berniecrat draws off a bunch of votes from your base the race is probably over before it begins. The tactic that the Democrats are using is a tried and true method straight out of the campaign manager playbook. The Greens needed 5,000 signatures to get on the ballot, with a minimum count in each of the state’s legislative district. They turned in more than 10,000, with more than 7,300 of them being eventually certified. Now Tester’s backers are asking for many of them to be thrown out, seeking to establish a pattern which might convince the judge to toss the Green Party from the ballot. The parties involved only have until Friday to make their respective cases and the primary is scheduled for next week. Even if the Democrats prevail, it’s going to look awfully fishy to take the Greens off the general election ballot after they’ve had their primary and selected a candidate. Break out the popcorn, because the Montana Senate race just became even more interesting. ",

        "articles": "It hasn’t been a good week for Democrats’ political messaging on the coronavirus crisis — and it’s only Tuesday. Their normal media cover disappeared when Nancy Pelosi blew up negotiations in the Senate over the CARES Act, with even the New York Times making it clear that Senate Democrats obstructed progress for badly-needed emergency economic relief. Today, the Washington Post rebukes the Joe Biden campaign for falsely asserting that Donald Trump silenced a CDC official who raised an early alarm on COVID-19. The campaign released a video with this claim from former Obama administration official and current Team Biden campaign adviser Ron Klain: Everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. But do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us: pic.twitter.com/XRkIw2EzM4 — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) March 21, 2020 “All the while, anyone who raised an alarm about this — a red flag — was silenced. Look no further than Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a career official at the Centers for Disease Control who was the first to raise the alarm. … Starting the next day, Dr. Messonnier no longer appeared at public briefings of the White House coronavirus task force. The president and the White House sent a clear message to scientists in the government — there would be a price for speaking out and speaking up.” Nonsense, writes Glenn Kessler, although the video ended up getting 4 million hits. What actually happened was that Trump started escalating the seriousness of the briefings by using higher-ranking officials: At the Feb. 26 news conference, Trump announced that Vice President Pence was taking charge of the task force. (Previously, Azar had run it.) From then on, briefings were held at the White House, not the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump headlines each one. One would presume either the director or deputy director would be onstage with the president, not a lower-ranking official. Messonnier still briefed reporters on behalf of the CDC for at least the next two weeks, as well as on CDC video updates, such as this one a week prior to Klain’s video: CDC Briefing Room: Dr. Nancy Messonnier gives an update on #COVID19. For more info visit  pic.twitter.com/6A8jvnVn0w — CDC (@CDCgov) March 14, 2020 Kessler doesn’t mention it, but on the same day that Messonnier allegedly offered a briefing that angered Trump so much he allegedly silenced her, Dr. Anthony Fauci was on television telling reporters the same thing. On MSNBC no less, where Katy Tur used the occasion to take shots at Trump: If Trump was inclined to muzzle Messonnier over her remarks, why is Fauci still appearing on the dais with Trump at White House briefings? Fauci hasn’t been silenced at all, not even when he disagrees with Trump, at least not yet. Instead, he’s become a rock star of sorts. Kessler concludes by wondering why Team Biden didn’t just stick to criticisms with a more factual basis, rather than simply make stuff up: We concede that news reports indicate Trump was upset by her remarks — and that there are signs he is tired of warnings from scientists and doctors as the economy implodes. He has certainly lashed out at people who have disagreed with him or given him information that conflicted with his point of view. We’ve documented Trump’s many false or misleading claims about the coronavirus outbreak. But that’s no excuse for this video to claim Messonnier was silenced when, in fact, she kept briefing reporters. Klain would have been on more solid ground to refer to the reporting that Messonnier’s message annoyed Trump. But instead, the video created a false narrative. The Biden campaign earns Four Pinocchios. One has to also ask why Biden and his team would want to make up lies in the middle of a national crisis. There is enough anxiety and stress on Americans as it is without adding to it by falsely undermining the credibility of those higher-ranking CDC officials who are now speaking from the White House briefing room. That’s exactly what Klain did in his video — imply that those officials are only speaking because they stick to Trump’s narrative — and it’s unconscionable. There will be plenty of time to play electoral politics after the crisis has passed and people are less at risk. If this is a preview of what a Joe Biden presidency would look like, voters should take a hard pass. ",

        "articles": "This entire process certainly didn’t start with Michael Bloomberg, but he definitely made it famous. The subject at hand is the increasing popularity of soda taxes (or more broadly, “sugary drink” taxes) as the latest sin tax of choice among liberals. It’s been attempted in various places, but one of the more recent ones was enacted in 2015 in the liberal bastion of Berkeley, California. Since going into effect there have definitely been some impacts on the local economy and this piece from Time Magazine attempts to pick out some sweet spots in the data (if you’ll pardon the pun) as proof that the system is “working.” Let’s see what they came up with. The researchers looked at whether the tax impacted the buying behaviors of Berkeley residents. They found that one year after the tax took effect, sales of sugar-sweetened drinks fell by close to 10%, and sales of water increased in Berkeley by about 16%. Sales of unsweetened teas, milk and fruit juices also went up, suggesting people were substituting their sugary drinks with healthier alternatives… The findings suggest that even in higher-income communities, a soda tax can impact sales. Popkin predicts that the drops would be even greater in cities and counties with lower-income communities. In Mexico, which passed a similar tax that took effect in 2014, there have been significant declines in the consumption of sugary beverages. Among low-income residents, it dropped by 17% early on. So since the tax was enacted, sales of all sugar sweetened drinks fell by 10% in the area where the tax was collected. I suppose if we bring the conversation to a dead stop right there you might be led to believe that the effort was effective, eh? But as with so many other metrics in society, the raw numbers don’t speak to a host of other factors. Here’s one thought… Berkeley is a very liberal spot with lots of vegans and other “health conscious lifestyle” types of folks. Do you suppose that people were just looking for healthier options anyway? The study doesn’t tell us if this was a sudden reversal or part of a longer trend. Here’s another factor to consider. When you drive up the price of any goods or services, it’s true that some people will choose not to spend their money in that fashion. But others may seek a cheaper option. Here’s where the report goes completely off the tracks. (Emphasis added) Another interesting finding in the study was that sales of sugar-sweetened beverages in neighboring cities rose nearly 7%—possibly because people may be buying their soda where it’s cheaper. Yet Popkin says he’s skeptical that the number of people in Berkeley would be great enough to increase the rates of other cities substantially, and believes that the higher rates could be partially unrelated. So you were willing to flatly accept a 10% drop as being attributable to the tax, but you’re “skeptical” that the 7% rise next door could be caused by people buying in bulk where the product is cheaper? Yeah… that makes total sense. Far more likely is that the real drivers for these changers are, to some significant degree, attributable to normal market forces. When you drive up the cost of something people look for other options. That happened in Philadelphia where the city government decided to save the people from themselves with a similar soda tax. The net result seemed to be angry consumers, more people shopping in the nearby county without the tax and, just by the way, the local Pepsi plant laying off a bunch of their workers. Brilliant! None of this, of course, addresses the underlying problem with this approach. Since when is it the government’s job to engage in social engineering experiments using the power of taxation as a cudgel to wield against the citizens? If you honestly believe that soda is a dangerous product unfit for human consumption, then ban it. If the people support your efforts you will be reelected. But if it’s good enough to be legally sold, then don’t pretend you’re trying to make people healthier by letting them drink something that you are saying is borderline toxic while actually just filling the city government’s coffers with their grocery money. That’s both dishonest and insulting. ",

        "articles": "Dr. James Joyner has a thoughtful essay this week on the proper role and treatment of presidents and other governmental figures. Titled “We Have a President, Not a King” he explores the reactions of the president, the public and members of congress during the recent food fight over Obama’s upcoming address to congress. Despite the mythology that has been built up over the years, the president is not in charge of the Congress and the Speaker of the House owes him no deference whatsoever aside from the courtesy of calling him “Mr. President.” Boehner answers only to the constituents of Ohio’s 8th Congressional District and, as Speaker, to the House Republican Caucus. Nor is the Speaker in any way obligated to jump through hoops to accommodate the president’s political schedule. An address to a Joint Session of Congress is a rare event, usually reserved for the annual State of the Union address and the occasional breaking emergency. Given a week’s notice and an obviously-politically-motivated ploy to hold the speech precisely when the Republican debate was long scheduled–not to mention only a few hours after Congress returns from a scheduled recess– it’s hardly unreasonable to insist the president push off a day. Frankly, given that the incredible likelihood that there will be nothing new here, with the president using the Congress as a background prop for what amounts to a political stump speech, Boehner would have been well within his rights to decline the request altogether. The television networks have quite often made that decision in recent years. The item that set Dr. Joyner off was a nearly inexplicable piece at MEDIAite by Tommy Christopher, where he somehow saw this event as reason enough to call on John Boehner to resign. (Joyner’s colleague, Doug Mataconis, wrote about it as well.) This isn’t the first unprecedented Republican insult to the presidency under Barack Obama (but it is, by far, the worst), and it isn’t even the first time John Boehner has tried to make the President “heel” with his datebook. It ought to be the last. Every American who has an appropriate respect for the office of the presidency should demand that John Boehner resign, and every legislator should amplify that demand. The problems facing this country are too great to be left in the hands of someone with such contempt for its highest office. By way of disclosure, I personally like Tommy. I’ve done some radio hits with him and have frequently enjoyed his acerbic sense of humor when it comes to the vagaries of American political life. (Which is frequently similar to my own.) But in this case, I honestly can’t fathom what he was thinking when he published that piece. When the news came out about the presidential request for a joint congressional session and how it played out, it seemed to me that President Obama was really acting like a … jerk. (For a peek inside the publishing process, I went through roughly a half dozen words there before settling on one which wouldn’t have had the management calling me out on the carpet.) I’m sorry to say, but there simply are no “coincidences” of this sort when you get to that level of the game. Sure… if I went and asked ten random workers at the local construction site when the next GOP debate was – assuming I could find ten people with jobs, that is – odds are that nine of them wouldn’t know. But for Barack Obama and his inner circle – a group engaged in a near panic level focus on trying to salvage the next election and finding out who they will face – the idea that they weren’t aware of the debate schedule is preposterous. I will take a slightly different angle than James Joyner, though, and point out that respect is earned by giving it in return, not simply by assuming a seat in some particular chair. And this goes for the President in his dealings with the Speaker as well. I see no other explanation for this than the likely proposition that Obama was simply trying to grandstand. If he could step on the GOP debate with some “historic” address to the Congress, he could demonstrate his Alpha Dog status by making them defer. And by immediately backing down as soon as Boehner sent a polite letter citing logistical reasons for pushing it back 24 hours, the effort blew up in his face. The only real question for me was, if he didn’t have a back-up plan in the event the Speaker demurred, why try this stunt at all? But even for all that, I wasn’t about to suggest that the President resign over it. If we got rid of every politician in Washington who acted like a jerk the place would have a population roughly matching that of Chernobyl today. Calling for Boehner to step down over this was more than a little bit of hyperbole even if you think Boehner was wrong. And in this case, he wasn’t. ",

        "articles": "Long time Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has been very angry with Chuck Grassley over what she perceives as his attempts to ruin her reputation by asking questions about her pay stubs. Following some new information which came out this week it’s going to be fascinating to hear why she wasn’t quite so vocal about federal investigators who were apparently trying to trash that same reputation more than a year ago and they were using the word embezzlement. Unbeknownst to the press and public, the feds were looking into her rather unique employment status and the payouts she received in the autumn of 2014. (Washington Times) Federal investigators formally investigated top Hillary Rodham Clinton aide Huma Abedin for the crime of embezzlement after confirming she took a “Babymoon” vacation and maternity time at the State Department without expending her formal leave, resulting in thousands of dollars of pay she wasn’t entitled to receive, The Washington Times has learned. The probe also gathered evidence she filed time sheets charging the government for impermissible overtime and excessive hours after she converted from a full-time federal employee to a State Department contractor. Those timecards were filed during a period that remains under investigation over questions about possible conflicts of interest, documents gathered by the State Department inspector general show. The feds were closing in on this case quite a while ago and they turned up more than we heard about this summer. It was rather laughable to think that she never took a single a single sick day or vacation the entire time she was there, including when she had a baby and went on vacation to France and Italy. But the questions don’t stop there by a long shot. According to this report, Abedin’s alleged violations happened in two phases. When she was initially employed at State as a full time staffer she failed to file required forms letting her employer know that she was taking leave and continued to receive her full pay. The Office of the Inspector General determined that this resulted in her receiving an overpayment of more than $10K when she officially left the position, part of a lump sum payment of roughly $33K. (Man… I have to get into government work.) But Huma had an explanation for why she never noticed… it was Anthony Weiner’s fault. She suggested her husband, the disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, failed to let her know. “My husband handles all the finances in our household,” she told investigators during a recorded interview in October 2014. She said she only learned of the payment after being contacted by investigators two years after her departure. “I did ask my husband to look up our bank statements, and we did have a deposit,” she said during her interview. Well… I guess that’s all cleared up then. But there was a second round of pay issues. After leaving her full time position she continued to be on the payroll as a “special government employee.” In this position Abedin was working as a contractor who had to bill the government for her hours. The rules state that contracted employees could only bill 1,040 hours for an entire year, but in only six months she had billed Uncle Sam for 1,290 hours. Good work if you can get it, I suppose. So why wasn’t she held to account for this taxpayer money? The answer here really carries a bit of a stench. After more than a year of investigations the IG’s office turned over the case to Justice for prosecution. They declined. The “alleged violations” cited were improperly requesting and approving annual leave and “embezzlement,” the documents state. “The case was not declined based on the merits of the investigation,” stated the final investigative report, dated Jan. 26. Such a designation usually means federal prosecutors decided not to pursue a case, but only because they didn’t think it worth the resources, not because the facts and evidence couldn’t support a case. So the OIG felt that they had enough of a clear cut case to go after her for embezzlement, but the Justice Department found that it wasn’t worth the resources to pursue her. My, my, my… that’s awfully convenient. We’re not talking about an insubstantial amount of money here for one employee and it’s part of the public purse. But for some strange reason the case wasn’t worth going after so they dropped it. This government job thing is sounding better and better. ",

        "articles": "It was a noble effort to be sure and a pretty good plan (all things considered) for as long as it lasted. Sadly, that wasn’t terribly long at all. We’re talking about the effort by some Baltimore community leaders to enact a 72 hour “ceasefire” in the city. John noted the kickoff of the effort on Friday, while I’d described my own concerns about the prospects for success a couple of weeks earlier. It was an effort that was labeled nobody kill anybody weekend, and it was supposed to run from Friday morning until Sunday night. They made it until Saturday afternoon. (Reuters) A 24-year-old man was shot and killed in Baltimore on Saturday, police said, breaking a 72-hour “ceasefire” called by activists who had pleaded for a pause in the city’s record homicide rate. Community leaders organized around the social media hashtag Baltimore Ceasefire issued a general plea that “no one kills anyone” during the 72 hours of Friday, Saturday and Sunday. After no homicides were reported on Friday, the fatal shooting occurred shortly after 5 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Saturday, police said in a statement. “The victim was rushed to an area hospital by friends,” police said, but he was pronounced dead at the Maryland Shock Trauma Center. As I said previously, it was a gallant and worthwhile effort. At this point somebody had to try something, and it might as well start with the community. And if we’re going to charitably count the “weekend” as beginning one minute past midnight Friday morning, the city managed to make it 41 hours without a murder. (There was another shooting earlier on Saturday but the victim survived.) As terrible as it may sound to say it aloud, that’s really not too shabby for Baltimore. We’re now 216 days into 2017 and the body count in the city is just slightly less than that number, averaging roughly one murder per day. If they’d managed to make it seven more hours that would have been two straight days. Okay, that’s not really a good statistic by any definition, but it’s better than nothing. Unfortunately, the group organizing the ceasefire took to their social media pages to decry the violence but somehow couldn’t resist the temptation to spread the blame around a bit too far. (Emphasis added) “There is a war going on in Baltimore right now. We are experiencing genocide among our African-American males, both by the hands of the Police Department and from one another. We the people need a call to action in order to save the city and our community for our future generations,” Baltimore Ceasefire said on its Facebook page. A “genocide… by the hands of the Police Department?” Not for nothing, but I was looking through the list of possible lethal force encounters with police for 2017 and I managed to find one. And that guy was holding a foot-long knife to the throats of a one year old and a four year old when negotiations finally broke down and the cops took him out. By contrast (falling into the category of “from one another” mentioned by the ceasefire group), criminals have murdered more than 210 of you in Charm City. That’s significantly more than in New York City and Baltimore is less than one tenth the size of the Big Apple. I realize that many folks out on the streets are still upset over the whole Freddie Gray thing, but talking about some sort of “police genocide” at this juncture seems to be leading us off the path of what might otherwise be a productive discussion. You seem to be off to a good, or at least potentially promising start with this idea of community leaders trying to reach out to the gang members and cut back on the killing. Perhaps we should concentrate on that for a while rather than blaming the police. The Black Guerilla Family, the Bloods and the Crips are the problem you really need to be focusing on. ",

        "articles": "Alternate headline: Even the hard-taught lessons don’t always stick. Facing their third cycle of defeat in a row under her leadership, sources within the House Democrats tell The Hill that Nancy Pelosi will survive in her current leadership role — in part to boost the chances of Hillary Clinton: “I think she stays for sure, and there are two reasons,” said a former House lawmaker who worked alongside Pelosi for years. “One is the presidential cycle. … It’s very much a symbiotic proposition: Hillary’s chances and Nancy’s longevity,” the Democrat said. “The second reason [is] … that nothing major is going to happen in the next two years without House Democratic votes, and it puts her in a position of leveraging those votes to accomplish at least some of our agenda.” Retiring Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.) echoed that message, saying he’s seen no indication the hard-charging Pelosi is ready to call it quits. “I hear the rumors, you know, that she’ll prevail in this election easily but then turn it over to her daughter. [But] she never told me that, and until she does I don’t have any real reason to believe it,” Moran, a 12-term congressman, said by phone. “I think we have to take Nancy at her word … that she’s committed to leading the Democratic caucus and electing a Democratic president in 2016.” Asked about the Hillary Clinton factor, Moran didn’t hesitate. “I think Nancy would love to be the first female Democratic Speaker to serve under the first female Democratic president,” he said. How much should we buy this argument? It sounds like the kind of bravado one usually hears before any election, even one turning as sour as this midterm cycle appears to going for the Democrats. The suspense is all in the upper chamber, and victory for Democrats there has been defined as only losing five Senate seats to the Republicans. Even with that low bar, their odds of prevailing seem to get longer every day. No one has seriously suggested that Pelosi would lead House Democrats back to a majority in this cycle. Right now it’s beginning to look like the second blowout in three cycles for the former Speaker, who managed to secure a majority for her party in only one cycle since taking the gavel in 2007. That came in 2008, when Barack Obama rather than Nancy Pelosi led the party to a win, and even her 2006 victory had more to do with George W. Bush being President. In fact, that might be the argument that Democrats use to keep her around as their leader in the House. When was the last time the GOP made Pelosi the center of their attacks? It was the last time she had any influence on matters, which was in the fall of 2010, right before she lost the majority. Neither this election nor either of the last two had much to do with Pelosi, although Republicans certainly used her as a bête noire in 2010 to good effect. They aren’t this time, though, because Obama is a much more effective foil, especially because he keeps attaching himself so effectively to Democrats facing tough elections. So Democrats might feel that at least the last two losses were not exactly Pelosi’s fault. That’s true as far as it goes, but even so, Pelosi is hardly an asset at this point except in turning out the base — and it doesn’t appear she’s doing much along those lines anyway. She’s the progressive figure that allows Republicans to turn her into a polarizing figure at almost any point they want. That’s why the idea that this helps Hillary Clinton doesn’t make much sense. If Hillary runs for the nomination, that might work to her benefit, but not in a general election when Hillary will need to move away from Obama and especially the progressive agenda. This sounds like pre-election bravado rather than a realistic assessment at all levels. If House Democrats suffer another large setback in two weeks, the decision probably won’t be Pelosi’s anyway.

        "articles": "The Atlantic has an interesting piece on Jordan Peterson today. Actually, the piece isn’t about Peterson per se, but about what is driving the left’s over-the-top reaction to Peterson. Author Caitlin Flanagan notes that the cultural gatekeepers on the left seem determined to make sure Peterson remains outside the camp, but so far it’s not working: It’s hard to think of a best-selling self-help book whose author has not appeared on the classic morning shows; these programs—Today and Good Morning America and CBS This Morning—are almost entirely devoted to the subject of self-help. But the producers did their part, and Peterson did not go to their studios to sit among the lifestyle celebrities and talk for a few minutes about the psychological benefits of simple interventions in one’s daily life. This should have stopped progress, except Peterson was by then engaged in something that can only be compared to a conventional book tour if conventional book tours routinely put authors in front of live audiences well in excess of 2,500 people, in addition to the untold millions more listening to podcasts and watching videos. (Videos on Peterson’s YouTube channel have been viewed, overall, tens of millions of times.) It seemed that the book did not need the anointing oils of the Today show.. There is an eagerness to attach reputation-destroying ideas to him, such as that he is a supporter of something called “enforced monogamy,” an anthropological concept referring to the social pressures that exist in certain cultures that serve to encourage marriage. He mentioned the term during a wide-ranging interview with a New York Times reporter, which led to the endlessly repeated falsehood that he believes that the government should be in the business of arranging marriages. There is also the inaccurate belief that he refuses to refer to transgender people by the gendered pronoun conforming to their identity. What he refuses to do is to abide by any laws that could require compelled speech. There are not-so-subtle attempts to ignore or damage him by the media being driven by what looks like fear. Flanagan concludes the core of the rejection of Peterson is fear, fear that he is undermining the foundation of modern leftism: identity politics. The left, while it currently seems ascendant in our houses of culture and art, has in fact entered its decadent late phase, and it is deeply vulnerable. The left is afraid not of Peterson, but of the ideas he promotes, which are completely inconsistent with identity politics of any kind… When the top man at The New York Times publishes a sober statement about a meeting he had with the president in which he describes instructing Trump about the problem of his “deeply troubling anti-press rhetoric,” and then three days later the paper announces that it has hired a writer who has tweeted about her hatred of white people, of Republicans, of cops, of the president, of the need to stop certain female writers and journalists from “existing,” and when this new hire will not be a beat reporter, but will sit on the paper’s editorial board—having a hand in shaping the opinions the paper presents to the world—then it is no mystery that a parallel culture of ideas has emerged to replace a corrupted system. When even Barack Obama, the poet laureate of identity politics, is moved to issue a message to the faithful, hinting that that they could be tipping their hand on all of this—saying during a speech he delivered in South Africa that a culture is at a dead end when it decides someone has no “standing to speak” if he is a white man—and when even this mayday is ignored, the doomsday clock ticks ever closer to the end. I think this is essentially right and not just about Peterson. Many of the members of the so-called Intellectual Dark Web were (or still are) left-leaning individuals who refused to buckle before the identity politics juggernaut. That’s the case with Bret Weinstein who was accused of racism by students at Evergreen State College and refused to go along with his own public shaming. Not only that, Weinstein pointed out that the students themselves were behaving like an irrational cult based partly on their assumptions about race. Not so many years ago, Sam Harris was considered part of the avant-garde of new atheism. Then he ran afoul of the left’s embrace of Islam by suggesting that not all religions are equally harmful. Suddenly he was an Islamophobe, a weird label through which the left equates belonging to a specific religion by choice with immutable, heritable characteristics like race. Peterson’s move from mostly unknown college professor to whatever he is today started with a law in Canada which, as mentioned above, he took as an attempt to compel speech. He rejected it on the basis that individuals should not be compelled to say things by their government. It was about individualism over the demands of identity politics. For Peterson, the most important achievement of western society is the recognition of the importance of the individual. As he says in the clip below, our free market system based on the individual is terrible except when compared to all the others. The left really does have something to worry about if their focus on unionizing people by race and gender fails. ",

        "articles": "She’s not asking this question idly. Hillary, who’s gearing up for a sub-moronic identity-politics campaign, actually did say recently that rape accusers have “the right to be believed” even though her own husband has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault. How does she resolve that dilemma? I thought she’d never be asked, for the simple reason that no one in the media would dare risk access to a future Clinton administration by putting her on the spot about it. But sometimes, my friends, the questions don’t come from the media. Sometimes a candidate has to face the voters. And that’s when magical things can happen. Here’s the clip, via the Free Beacon. Obviously there’s no good answer to this question, which is why so many righties perked up when she first said something about the right to be believed. She set a trap for herself. If she stands by it now, it means she sides with Juanita Broaddrick over Bill. If she walks it back, which is what she has no choice but to do — accusers should be believed unless the evidence says otherwise, she clarifies — then it undermines the whole point of the pander. The “right to be believed” bit was her way of trying to leverage the feminist frenzy over “rape culture”; she was signaling to young women, whose votes she desperately needs, that she shares the progressive belief that rape defendants are guilty until proven innocent. Now that she’s on the spot, she retreats to the banal point that we should go where the evidence leads us. In practice, the “right to be believed” amounts to nothing more than the idea that the police should investigate when someone claims they’re the victim of a horrendous violent crime. All of us who took first-grade civics can agree. Exit question: If accusers have a right to be taken seriously, if not quite “believed,” does that mean she took Broaddrick seriously when she first accused Bill of assault? That’s a follow-up question for the next townhall attendee who gets to quiz her. ",

        "articles": "If the motives to wipe the hard drive on Hillary Clinton’s e-mail server weren’t already crystal clear, a new development last night put it in Ultra HD. Gawker’s Jeff Girth and Sam Biddle uncovered a secret, private intelligence network run by Sidney Blumenthal for Hillary’s benefit, apart from the State Department’s own Bureau of Intelligence and Research. Hackers got e-mails that went through Hillary’s private server between her and Blumenthal, e-mails that show her own private intel group was also warning her that Libya was collapsing in the weeks and months prior to the sacking of the consulate in Benghazi: Starting weeks before Islamic militants attacked the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, longtime Clinton family confidante Sidney Blumenthal supplied intelligence to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gathered by a secret network that included a former CIA clandestine service officer, according to hacked emails from Blumenthal’s account. The emails, which were posted on the internet in 2013, also show that Blumenthal and another close Clinton associate discussed contracting with a retired Army special operations commander to put operatives on the ground near the Libya-Tunisia border while Libya’s civil war raged in 2011. Blumenthal’s emails to Clinton, which were directed to her private email account, include at least a dozen detailed reports on events on the deteriorating political and security climate in Libya as well as events in other nations. They came to light after a hacker broke into Blumenthal’s account and have taken on new significance in light of the disclosure that she conducted State Department and personal business exclusively over an email server that she controlled and kept secret from State Department officials and which only recently was discovered by congressional investigators. It also seems that Hillary’s private intelligence operation penetrated other intel groups, including those of allies. On one level, one could be impressed with the organization of such an effort — if it had led to better choices. Instead, the hacked e-mail trail here has Hillary’s own network warning her of a string of terrorist attacks in Benghazi three weeks before the attack on our consulate. By that time, of course, the US facility had already been hit by a bomb attack two months prior to these warnings, yet Hillary and Patrick Kennedy did nothing to boost security or get American personnel out of harms’ way. Why, with these warnings ringing in her ears, did she allow US Ambassador Chris Stevens to come to Benghazi at all? By the way, the e-mails also speak to the “YouTube video” cover story, and makes it clear that Hillary’s own private network had discounted the claim 48 hours after the attack: On September 12, 2012, the day after the Benghazi attack, Blumenthal sent a memo that cited a “sensitive source” saying that the interim Libyan president, Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, was told by a senior security officer that the assault was inspired by an anti-Muslim video made in the U.S., as well as by allegations by Magariaf’s political opponents that he had CIA ties. Blumenthal followed up the next day with an email titled “Re: More Magariaf private reax.” It said Libyan security officials believed an Islamist radical group called the Ansa al Sharia brigade had prepared the attack a month in advance and “took advantage of the cover” provided by the demonstrations against the video. So, according to both Hillary’s spy network and the CIA, everyone knew by September 14th that this was a planned attack and not a spontaneous demonstration gone awry. Yet for the next two weeks, the Obama administration and Hillary herself kept up the pretense that this was not a terrorist attack, even lying to the families of the dead about the central role of the YouTube video. Why? This goes beyond cover stories, though. What was a Secretary of State doing in running her own private intelligence service — and providing so little security for its communications? It’s getting very obvious why 32,000 e-mails got deleted from a four-year period, something like 21 e-mails every day in every year. It wasn’t just notes to Bill or discussions of Chelsea’s wedding plans that got wiped, but the records of Clintons’ clandestine network of operatives. Hugh Hewitt interviewed Chuck Todd on last night’s show about this revelation, and what it means for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. In this excerpt, Todd tells Hugh that “nothing involving Sidney Blumenthal surprises me”: CT: Well, and this is the pattern of Hillary Clinton, something I brought up last week. The pattern of her political career is when she is front and center, the polarizing view of Hillary Clinton comes into focus. And when she is off the front pages and is sort of a player but on the sidelines, like when she was a Senator or when she was Secretary of State, her numbers go up. And as a presidential candidate, and when she’s at the center, you know, I think all of a sudden, there is, and she might blame that press, that the press has old habits die hard, they only cover her like she’s a Clinton from the 90s, and so it doesn’t matter. But all of a sudden, I think this is such a big challenge in the email story, is not the email story itself, it’s the idea that it creates the ‘oh, there they go again, this is the 90s all over again.’ And if Clinton fatigue, which is already a disease in the press corps, actually becomes a problem with the voting public, and these polls, maybe this is the first time that it’s becoming a problem, that is doom for her. HH: It is a rumbling drum in the background. Now the Blumenthal story is different. I thought until today, actually earlier this week when I began to get wind of this, that Blumenthal would send her emails and she would write him back, and it was the kind of thing where you had a former aide, a hanger-on, and you stay in touch with everyone. No. He’s running a private intelligence operation on the Libyan-Tunisian border through former CIA operatives. Chuck Todd, if W. had done that, or actually, Condi Rice or Colin Powell would be the appropriate analogy… CT: Yeah. HH: …people would be tearing their hair out. CT: And yet I have to say nothing involving Sid Blumenthal surprises me. Zero. And I agree. I think this, I saw this Gawker stuff. You know, you’ve got, it’s Gawker and all this stuff, but I’ve learned over the years, nothing involving Sid Blumenthal is surprising. And you know, for some reason, they’ve had, he’s blindly loyal to them, and I think the Clintons have always had a blind spot with him, because he skirts the rules. Later, though, Hugh and Todd both drive the point home about private intel networks, wiped drives, and Congressional investigations: HH: But Sid Blumenthal is known as Sid Vicious for a reason, and none of those people, to my knowledge, ran a foreign private intelligence operation, because it raises, Chuck Todd, and this would go… CT: Well, I don’t know about Nixon. Don’t forget ol’ G. Gordon. But when he was around… HH: Well, he was domestically, domestically. But here’s what it raises. If they’ve got a private server and a private citizen collecting private intel, it is highly likely it’s compromised going into the Secretary of State’s server. I mean, it’s just going to raise all sorts of fun. If there was on the right someone with the chops of some of the famous investigative reporters for the New Yorker, this would be keeping them up all night. CT: I think, and look, I think all things Sid are going to become a big part of our, I think this is going to get a lot of attention. And I don’t think it’s a right, left, right, center. And you know, this is going to be, I think, the more explosive part of the first time she testifies on Benghazi. I mean, I think the Blumenthal stuff is going to be the stickiest wicket for her. Small wonder Hillary had the hard drive wiped after the Benghazi select committee began demanding data from it. When Richard Nixon had the “plumbers,” we nearly had an impeachment (a process in which a young Hillary Clinton worked, as it happens). This is blatantly Nixonian, and it’s just a taste of what we can expect if the Clintons come back into the White House. ",

        "articles": "Despite having pledged to take a balanced approach to energy issues during her confirmation hearings, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland made some of the worst predictions by Republicans about actions on such matters come true yesterday. Haaland revoked a dozen different energy policy orders put in place during the Trump administration, announcing that her priorities would be to address climate change and shift to “the green energy potential” of public lands, assuming any energy is to be produced at all. These moves not only fly in the face of many promises that Joe Biden made on the campaign trail, but also undermine statements that Haaland herself made this year when trying to tunnel her way through the confirmation process. Of course, absolutely nobody who has been paying attention will be surprised by these developments as they were all predicted by energy hawks who were familiar with the Secretary’s background. (Associated Press) Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on Friday revoked a series of Trump administration orders that promoted fossil fuel development on public lands and waters, and issued a separate directive that prioritizes climate change in agency decisions. The moves are part of a government-wide effort by the Biden administration to address climate change ahead of a virtual global summit on climate change that President Joe Biden is hosting next week. “From day one, President Biden was clear that we must take a whole-of-government approach to tackle the climate crisis, strengthen the economy and address environmental justice,” Haaland said in a statement. The new orders will “make our communities more resilient to climate change and … help lead the transition to a clean energy economy,″ she added. Just as a reminder of the verbal gymnastics Haalend engaged in to worm her way into this position, let’s return for a moment to her opening statement during her confirmation hearings. She said, without any apparent irony, “As I’ve learned in this role, there’s no question that fossil energy does and will continue to play a major role in America for years to come. I know how important oil and gas revenues are to fund critical services.” Well, so much for that. I’ve grown far too jaded over decades of observing American politics to be shocked to see a politician lying, but this is pretty egregious. It’s being made clear that Haaland’s first (and probably only) priority will be satisfying the Green New Deal people when setting energy policy at the Interior Department. Drilling permits for both public lands and offshore deposits will soon become rarer than honest politicians. If you’re from an energy-producing state and you voted for Joe Biden, I really don’t know what to tell you if you have the nerve to act surprised now. You’ll recall that during the final stages of the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden falsely told voters in Pennsylvania that he never said he wanted to ban fracking. But even Newsweek was forced to admit that Biden absolutely did say that with no ambiguity whatsoever. (Biden’s team later sent out an aide to “clarify the confusion” over his remarks, setting a pattern that continues to this day, with most of the press playing along with it.) During Donald Trump’s presidency, America went from being beholden to foreign (and often hostile) nations to meet our energy needs to hold a position as a dominant global force in energy production. In 2019 and 2020 the country cemented its position as a net exporter of energy in the oil and gas sector. Plentiful supplies from our refineries drove gas prices down for extended periods of time. Vastly increased production of clean-burning natural gas resulted in cheaper home heating costs and steep reductions in coal production (which the green warriors should have been thrilled about but gave Trump no credit for) as coal-fired power plants converted over to cheaper and cleaner natural gas burners. It was one of the signature accomplishments of the Trump administration. Yesterday’s announcements pretty much signal an end to all of that. Democrats are not only talking about jacking up the national gas tax, but the gas itself will become more expensive to begin with. Everyone with a job working on pipeline projects or in the industries that support such construction should probably learn to code or something. Joe Biden was blatantly dishonest about his energy policy plans while campaigning for office and his new top lieutenant on the climate-change front will now be clamping down on our ability to maintain our previous productivity levels.

        "articles": "Oh, grow up. Not even Republicans believe this would offend POTUS. (VPOTUS, on the other hand…) His position on gay marriage was ably summarized by Ramesh Ponnuru a week ago: He consistently says he’s against it but he’s also consistently signaled that he doesn’t much care. Which, I think, actually makes him a good representative of general Republican opinion on gay marriage right now. Most are still against it but few seem to get exercised about it anymore. Asked about the topic in June 2015, Trump told Jake Tapper he was for “traditional marriage.” A few weeks later, after the Supreme Court held that all states had to recognize same-sex marriage, Trump told Howard Kurtz he would have preferred for the Court to have left states to make their own decisions but suggested that overturning the ruling was not a priority. He told The Hollywood Reporter it was a “dead issue.” But in January 2016, before the Iowa caucuses, he told Chris Wallace that he would “strongly consider” appointing justices who would overturn the ruling. After winning the November 2016 election he said that whether he supported or opposed same-sex marriage was “irrelevant” because the Supreme Court had made its ruling, adding, “I’m fine with that.” Even the left rarely accuses Trump of having heartfelt socially conservative views. When they ding him for supporting socially conservative policies the criticism is always framed in terms of political expedience, as him pandering to his evangelical base, rather than him being a “values” warrior in his core. How could it be otherwise? The idea of Trump being a “prude” of any sort, which is what this ad seems to imply, is farcical. There *are* “values” crusades that Trump will take up enthusiastically but they’re all of a nationalist variety, like his battle with the NFL over standing for the anthem. It’s silly to think he’d recoil from this. Remember, notes Ben Shapiro, this is a guy who held up a rainbow flag at one of his final rallies in 2016. But all of that is beside the point. Strategically this spot is of a piece with the ad being run across the border in Virginia by Democrat Dan Helmer calling Trump the biggest threat to the country since Osama Bin Laden. Different candidate here, totally different approach, but the political circumstances are the same: Like Helmer, Rich Madaleno is stuck in a crowded Democratic primary and struggling to gain traction. The most recent poll had him way back in fourth place at six percent with former NAACP chief Benjamin Jealous ahead at 21. But the odds are even longer for Madaleno than they appear. Although Maryland is a blue state, it has a phenomenally popular Republican governor in Larry Hogan, who currently enjoys a 71 percent(!!) approval rating. Even if Madaleno were to get out of the primary, he’s probably a sitting duck in the general. But first things first: How do you grab the attention of Dem voters when you’re sitting at six percent? You run a gimmicky ad like this one calling Trump out by name — and you air it on Fox News during “Fox & Friends” in the D.C. market, hoping/expecting that Trump will see it. That is to say, as with Helmer, this is Madaleno’s attempt to taunt Trump into responding to him on Twitter, knowing that earning the public enmity of the president would give him instant cred and name recognition among local Democrats. It was a long shot but one worth taking. If it worked he was golden, if it didn’t work (and it hasn’t) at least he did something showy to get his name out there and to brand himself ostentatiously anti-Trump before Maryland Dems go to vote. When you’re at six percent, you’ll try anything. ",

        "articles": "Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen stopped by for her semi-annual chat with the House Financial Services Committee this week and things didn’t go quite as smoothly as such a periodic review generally does. One of the members had a few questions for her regarding oversight of the newest agency under her control, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Specifically, they wanted to know about the budget going to the bureau, who reviewed it, who approved it and if there was any control over what was spent. Her answers were, shall we say, less than inspiring. (Daily Caller) The video is even worse than the transcript makes it sound. Yellen looked befuddled when Republican Rep. Andy Barr, who sits on the committee, confronted her with a series of simple questions about the CFPB. Barr first asked Yellen if the Federal Reserve approves the CFPB’s budget. After seven silent seconds as Yellen sought help, she haltingly said, “I’m not sure.” then added, “I mean we fund the bureau’s budget.” “Do you approve the budget?” Barr asked. Again, Yellen was stumped, and she looked left and right for staff assistance. “I don’t think,” she said uncertainly. “I think the answer is no,” she continued as she shoved personal items into a hand bag preparing to leave the hearing room. “Can you veto specific allocation requests,” Barr then asked. “I…I don’t think so,” the Fed chief replied. You’d think she might be doing some checking into what’s going on at the CFPB, particularly considering how often they wind up in court. They recently exacted a huge settlement from Toyota because of racial disparities detected in how much interest was being charged to black and Asian borrowers. The potential problem there is that Toyota was charging everyone the same interest rate based on their credit rating with no racial demographic information available. The difference was coming from a “mark-up” increase in the rates being charged by the local dealers. This continues a pattern which began when the agency was first set up and they grossly overran their own estimated cost of constructing their headquarters. With nobody keeping a close enough eye on the taxpayers’ cash, money just has a tendency to disappear. After their shaky start, one might imagine that Janet Yellen would be keeping a closer eye on their books, but apparently she’s not even sure she has the power to do that. ",

        "articles": "Some high-five material for Cruz fans from WaPo and PPP. A little post-announcement bounce here or something more? In the contest for the Republican nomination, Bush tops the field with 20 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents saying they would support him if their primary or caucus were held today. He is followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 13 percent and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 12 percent. Five other Republicans receive at least 6 percent support, with an additional six candidates at either 2 or 1 percent. Bush, Cruz and Walker are the only three to register noticeable gains since the last Post-ABC survey on the GOP race in December. He was tied for third place at eight percent in WaPo’s December poll, so maybe this is just a bounce. Or, per PPP, maybe not: PPP’s newest Republican national poll finds that Ted Cruz has the big momentum following the official announcement of his candidacy last week. His support has increased from 5% to 16% in just over a month, enough to make him one of three candidates in the top tier of GOP contenders, along with Scott Walker and Jeb Bush. Walker continues to lead the field with 20%, although that’s down from his 25% standing a month ago. Bush continues to poll at 17%, followed by Cruz at 16%, Ben Carson and Rand Paul at 10%, Marco Rubio and Mike Huckabee at 6%, Chris Christie at 4%, and Rick Perry at 3%. Cruz has really caught fire with voters identifying themselves as ‘very conservative’ since his announcement. After polling at only 11% with them a month ago, he now leads the GOP field with 33% to 25% for Walker and 12% for Carson with no one else in double digits. Last month Walker led with that group and almost all of the decline in his overall support over the last month has come within it as those folks have moved toward Cruz. Cruz’s name recognition with Republican voters has increased from 61% to 82% since his announcement. The key detail: Not only is Cruz eating up some of Walker’s conservative support, he’s also (predictably) now eating up some of Ben Carson’s and Mike Huckabee’s. Carson dropped from 18 percent in PPP’s last poll to 10 percent this month while Huckabee’s dipped from 10 percent to six percent. That’s exactly what Cruz needs to give him legs in the primaries. The more social conservatives decide they prefer the polished, full-spectrum conservative to the novice Carson or the squishier Huck, the likelier it is that Cruz will consolidate values voters. That would make him a legit threat in Iowa and South Carolina. And yeah, granted, Cruz has a unique poll advantage at the moment in that he’s the only candidate to have officially declared that he’s running; Carson, Huckabee, Walker, and Paul will all receive bounces of their own when they announce, carving off pieces of Cruz’s support — in theory. In practice, I’m not sure that’s true: It’s easy to see why Christian conservatives would migrate from Carson to Cruz, who checks all the same values boxes and is far better versed on policy. It’s not easy to see why they’d shift the opposite way, even after Carson formally jumps in. I think Cruz and Huck and will consume most of Carson’s support over the rest of the year, with social cons left divided between the two of them. You would think that’d be an easy match-up for Cruz given how many tea partiers love him and disdain Huckabee, but I don’t know. Huck will be positioning himself as a full-spectrum conservative for the primaries too, with little daylight between him and Cruz on most foreign and domestic policy questions. Once that happens, it may come down to a choice between their respective personal styles for many social cons, which would be a bad omen for Cruz given how personally popular Huckabee is among Republicans. (His favorable rating is routinely among the best of all GOP candidates.) Cruz’s campaign strategy over the next six months will be to convince voters that Rand Paul is far too squishy on foreign policy to be trusted while Huckabee is far too squishy on domestic policy. That’s his best shot at becoming a consensus social-con choice. There’s an X factor too that might help keep Cruz in the top tier even after everyone else has jumped into the pool. The brighter the spotlight shines on religious liberty after the RFRA wars in Indiana and Arkansas, the greater the opportunity for Cruz — and Huckabee — to impress conservatives by speaking out loudly and often as Christian champions of freedom of conscience. Dave Weigel joked on Twitter yesterday that he’s putting 20 bucks on Huckabee to be the first GOP candidate to show up in Walkerton, Indiana and buy a slice from Memories Pizza, but there’s political truth behind that gag. Huck and Cruz will spend the next nine months competing to be the most stalwart defender of values in the primary. The more the news involves conflicts over values, the more center-right voters may come to appreciate their message. And maybe not just center-right voters either. Oh, by the way: According to PPP, Chris Christie’s favorable rating among GOP primary voters right now is … 24/57. Hillary’s probably isn’t much worse. ",

The plotters allegedly admired Anwar al-Awlaki and did the usual mumbling about being soldiers of Allah, but all the NYT will tell you is that “They were frustrated … by American war policies.” Either that’s a nifty bit of whitewashing or else the Times simply assumes that you’re familiar enough with stories like this by now that you can fill in the blanks yourself by extrapolating from the suspects’ names. Cowardly or lazy, take your pick. Anyway. Each new day brings another step through the looking glass on Libya, and today it was the NYT’s turn. First Obama out-Bushed Bush, then Hillary started questioning the patriotism of war opponents, and now we’ve got the flagship paper of the liberal intelligentsia wondering why anyone would jeopardize American military credibility by pulling the plug before victory’s been declared. Really. Am I awake? One measure, sponsored by Representative Thomas Rooney and apparently backed by the House leadership, would allow financing only for American surveillance, search-and-rescue missions, planning and aerial refueling. Republicans say that if it passes, the Pentagon would have to halt drone strikes and attacks on Libyan air defenses. They claimed it would do minimal damage to the alliance and its campaign because the United States would still be providing some support. But the damage to this country’s credibility, and its leadership of NATO, would be enormous. Any sign that the United States is bailing out could lead others to follow… We also believe Congress has an important role to play in this debate. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to vote on the Kerry-McCain measure next week. The majority leader, Harry Reid, has said he has the votes in the Senate. Thankfully, some Senate Republicans also seem to understand the importance of the United States following through on its national security commitments. It’s not just the Times either. Check out the partisan split on Libya via Gallup: Despite the fact that “days, not weeks” has turned into months; despite the fact that NATO’s mission has lurched from one goal to another; despite the fact that Obama ignored his own lawyers when they suggested that the war was illegal; despite unusual bipartisan opposition in Congress; despite periodic reports of an ominous Islamist strain within the rebel ranks; and despite the fact that some NATO commanders are now suggesting that ground troops might be needed in the aftermath of Qaddafi’s fall to keep the peace, the number of Democrats who approve of the war has actually increased since it started. Who knows? If it drags on through the end of the year, he might end up with 60 percent approval from his base. Update: You know, in a way, I admire their shamelessness here. The NYT editorial board isn’t stupid; surely they know how preposterous it is for them to be taking a line this hawkish (especially on a war as compromised as this one is) after the past eight years. But darn if they didn’t do it to help Obama out. No pretense of consistency or neutral principles, just raw partisanship. There’s honesty in that, as hackish as it is. ",

        "articles": "Interesting contrast between this clip and Rush’s mano a mano with a caller yesterday. To the charge of disingenuously spinning for Trump on immigration, Rush pled not guilty by reason of entertainment. I never took Trump seriously on mass deportation, he told the caller (which was a lie), and I never endorsed him. I’m an entertainer who trusts you, the listener, to make up your own mind. Don’t blame me for Trump just because I’ve been running interference for him with grassroots conservatives for the past year. That’s one way to dodge blame for listener disappointment with the nominee: Simply minimize your own contribution to his success. Joe Scarborough’s following the same strategy. Hannity’s in a different position because he’s been such an enthusiastic mouthpiece for Trump for so long that there’s no way credibly to pretend that he hasn’t been on the Trump train. His blame-shifting strategy is simply to pound the table. I’m to blame for what looks like a dispiriting defeat this fall, he implies, just because I backed a guy to the hilt who’s been at 60 percent unfavorable in national polls since last summer? Screw you. You’re to blame. Here’s a taste from today’s rant; it goes on and on from here. “Well, let me just say to all of you. And that includes the commentator class. That includes the Jonah Goldberg class, that includes radio talk show hosts. Glenn Beck is like on a — it’s a holy war for him at this point. I mean, he’s off the rails attacking me every day. Blaming me for Trump. Well, no. I was fair to everybody, Glenn. Whether you want to admit it or not. I know I was fair. My conscience is clear. And I, frankly, I’m proud to pull the lever for Donald Trump with a clear conscience.”… “So here’s what I say to all of you Never Trumpers — Glenn Beck, I hope you’re listening. You own Hillary Clinton’s Supreme Court appointments. You own it! You are doing everything you can do to cast doubt in people’s minds! Trump gave us a list. You own her Supreme Court nominees, you own her un-vetted refugees and the 550% increase she will bring into this country. You own the jobs that illegal immigrants will take from the 95 million Americans out of the labor force. You own Obamacare, which is a disaster for this country. You own education, because she is beholden to the NEA. And if we don’t improve the lives of 95 million Americans out of the labor force, I blame you for that too!” “Because you’re helping elect her. And I’m also saying that, hey, we have a $4,100 increase in health care payments since Obama has been president. It’s only going to go higher. You get responsibility for that, too! We have got 12 million more Americans on food stamps. If that increases, I’m going to blame you! We have 46 million total. Eight million more Americans living in poverty. Fifty million Americans in poverty. If that gets worse, I’m blaming you! You know, we have the worst home ownership in 51 years. If that gets worse, guess who I’m blaming? I’m blaming all of you!” There’s seemingly no downturn in American life, including something as complicated as the number living in poverty, that #NeverTrumpers won’t be responsible for if Hillary wins, apparently regardless of whether or not the race is close. Right? If Clinton hangs an eight-point landslide on Trump, which would be tantamount to something like 10 million votes, I fully expect Hannity to be on the radio the next day insisting that 10 million people might have changed their minds if Jonah Goldberg and Beck had been Trump cheerleaders from the beginning. But never mind that. Let me repeat a point I made the last time Hannity went nuts over #NeverTrumpers: Does the candidate bear any responsibility for his current predicament? And don’t dismiss the question with an “Oh, sure, but #NeverTrumpers yadda yadda yadda…” Let’s stick with Trump’s culpability for a second. If he loses by five points, the same margin Romney lost by in 2012, what percentage of blame would Hannity say Trump bears for that margin compared to the percentage #NeverTrumpers bear? Let’s quantify this now. Because as I recall, when Romney crapped the bed, the apportionment of blame on talk radio between him and working-class voters who didn’t turn out for him was around 100/0. Here’s something new from PBS to inform your blame calculus: As the presidential election marathon breaks into a final sprint, the Trump campaign faces a jaw-dropping gap in the ground game: Hillary Clinton currently has more than three times the number of campaign offices in critical states than does Donald Trump… As of Aug. 30, Hillary Clinton has 291 offices in those 15 battlegrounds. Donald Trump has 88. (Those figures include joint presidential and party offices.) Both campaigns pledge that more offices are coming… That is just right now. The Trump campaign plans to open 57 Trump offices in [Pennsylvania, Florida, and North Carolina] in the next few weeks, according to Susie Wiles, a communications strategist for the campaign. But no matter how many staffers get on the ground, the Trump campaign faces a question of timing in many swing counties. “There’s an element of time required to get operational,” said Steve Schale, Obama’s campaign manager in Florida in 2008. “Little things like getting leases signed for offices, getting cell phones for organization, getting volunteers trained, these are not turnkey operations.” Field offices are where the nuts and bolts of voter turnout happen — identifying potential supporters, phoning them, following up, coordinating to get them transportation to the polls on Election Day, and so on. If you think “undercover Trump voters” are out there ready to deliver victory, it would help a lot for Trump to have people in the field identifying them aggressively and making sure they’re registered and that they know their closest polling place. Per PBS, Hillary has 36 different offices in Pennsylvania attending to those tasks right now (plus a sophisticated data operation to identify them). Trump has … two. The two states with the greatest number of Trump field offices at the moment are Wisconsin and Virginia, neither one of which is close in the polls. By some estimates, a big turnout advantage in a key battleground area can be worth six points, yet Trump’s getting swamped organizationally. I ask again: How much are #NeverTrumpers to blame for a loss this fall and how much is Donald “I don’t know that we need to get out the vote” Trump to blame? One more thing. At one point in today’s rant, Hannity said that if Trump becomes president and reneges on some of his promises, then Hannity will accept blame for that. That’s both untrue and a dodge. It’s a dodge in the sense that the relevant blame calculus here isn’t President Trump versus President Hillary, with Hannity on the hook for the former and #NeverTrumpers on the hook for the latter. The relevant blame calculus is Trump versus any other potential Republican nominee. The core complaint of #NeverTrumpers is that we didn’t need to be in this position, saddled with a deeply disliked loose cannon in a winnable race against a lackluster candidate in Clinton, and we might not have been in this position had grassroots influencers like Rush and Hannity spoken up against Trump forcefully in the primary. In January of this year, Lynn Vavreck noted today, a generic Republican led a generic Democrat by seven points, 46/39. Today that number is upside down, with the generic Democrat ahead by eight, 44/36. If a Clinton victory is the fault of #NeverTrumpers, why isn’t that generic-ballot reversal the fault of Trump apologists in talk radio? They could have had a competitive race this fall, but evidently they didn’t care enough about that in the spring to risk getting on the wrong side of their populist audiences. Stephen Miller’s summation of the talk-radio criticism of #NeverTrump is spot on:  And as for the idea that Hannity will stand up to President Trump if he breaks his promises, anyone who watched his show during the Bush years and then through the primaries this year knows it’s nonsense. He’ll be the best friend a Republican White House could ask for. That’s his role in the conservative media ecosystem, making sure that prominent Republicans have a friendly conduit to the base. The day President Trump decides that the only solution to ObamaCare’s woes is single-payer health care, Trump’s press secretary will be on the phone with Hannity arranging an interview for that night’s show to sell the plan to Republicans as a “conservative” solution. Same goes for amnesty for illegals. That’ll be the new party dogma, with Republicans who dissent attacked for playing into Democratic hands by opposing Trump’s policies, just like #NeverTrumpers are attacked now for proving that they meant it when they said they won’t vote for a candidate who isn’t conservative. And if all else fails, President Trump and Hannity will make sure they clear the lowest bar they can set by arguing that, however unhappy you might be with a Trump administration, a Clinton administration would have been worse. Trump can go as far left as he wants, breaking as many promises as he needs, and so long as he’s semi-plausibly still to Clinton’s right, that’ll be spun as something of a victory. That’s where the great populist revolution is headed. ",

        "articles": "Ed mentioned this piece in an earlier post but I feel obliged to give it an extra nudge. There are glitches, there are serious glitches, and then there’s number-one ObamaCare fan Ezra Klein running pieces on his WaPo blog wondering if a single human being has yet managed to enroll in O-Care via the Healthcare.gov website. And as icing on the cake, the post is punctuated with an image of … a unicorn. For the second time today: Am I awake? The federal government has said that somewhere out in this vast country of 313 million people, where 48 million lack insurance coverage, someone has managed to sign up for health insurance on the federally-run marketplaces. As of yet, we haven’t tracked this person – or these people – down… There are certainly lots of people trying to buy health insurance on the marketplace, that much is clear from my inbox. “I am trying to sign my wife up for an individual policy on Healthcare.gov and it’s still basically impossible,” one reader in Florida wrote to me Thursday morning. “I tried to create the account again and was told my username already existed for another account. I then closed the web browser and started looking around for a drink (if it weren’t 8:30 a.m…).”… But the federal marketplace is a bit of a black box right now. There’s been heavy traffic, with over 4.7 million visitors since the exchanges opened for enrollment on Tuesday. The White House says some applicants have signed up, but didn’t say how many. Rumors in the insurance industry hover in the single digits; several health plans say they are unaware of anyone signing up for their plan. BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina says it has enrolled one person. The good news? Since WaPo posted that this morning, they found someone who enrolled successfully on the federal exchange. His name’s Chad Henderson. It took him three hours and his plan cost him “a little more than I was expecting.” (Some enrollees on the state exchanges are finding the same thing.) And he’s now apparently spending most of his waking hours taking calls from reporters since he’s the only person they can find — in America — who can report a somewhat useful experience on the Healthcare.gov site. Obama tried to explain that away yesterday by claiming that the demand over the first two days has far exceeded expectations; in that case, how low were their expectations that they weren’t prepared for several million curiosity seekers on launch day of the most momentous social program in decades? Haven’t there been a few presidential speeches and a few thousand news stories over the past several weeks reminding people that October 1 was the big day? Did they … not understand that there might be a heavy load on government servers as a result? Philip Klein tried setting up an account on Healthcare.gov this morning and had to eat an even tastier shinola sandwich than he did on Tuesday. My Thursday morning attempt to login to the main Healthcare.gov hub that’s supposed to serve residents of 36 states, was greeted with a 404 error: “The requested URL /serverdown.html was not found.”… Roughly 40 percent of enrollees in the exchanges will need to be young and healthy so that they can offset the cost of covering sicker patients and those with pre-existing conditions. Those with extremely high medical expenses are the most likely to endure whatever technical hurdles arise and keep trying until they’re able to successfully enroll. But those who are more ambivalent — the young and healthy with low medical expenses — could get discouraged. That would have disastrous consequences for the law. For all of the outreach efforts by the administration and outside groups, word of mouth is likely to be the most powerful factor influencing people’s decisions about accessing the exchanges. The administration wants to get to the point where, if a bunch of friends in their 20s are talking about health insurance, one will say, “Oh, I went on that new Obamacare exchange and it was really easy and I was able to get affordable insurance, I’ll send you the link.” But instead, if too many people say, “I tried to buy insurance but the website was barely functional, and when I finally searched the plans they were more expensive than I thought,” it’s really going to dampen enrollment. And that, of course, explains why even Ezra Klein’s site is mocking the White House for its incompetence. The more bad press HHS gets about the website from the media, including friendly media — especially friendly media — the more urgently they’ll try to fix it. Embarrassing coverage could be useful to ObamaCare fans, frankly, in fanning the fire that’s been lit under the White House’s ass. Although, honestly, even if the site was glitchy for a month, I think O and his big-data brain trust would find ways to put the word out comprehensively once it’s fixed. They’ve got a gigantic mailing list and experts in social media on staff; reaching “young invincibles” to let them know that Healthcare.gov is no longer as unstable as Geocities circa 1995 can’t be that difficult for them, especially given the stakes. Via CNN, here’s Sanjay Gupta reporting yesterday on his experience with Kentucky’s state-run health exchange website, which did somehow manage to enroll a few thousand people — and, apparently, frustrated many, many more. Gupta says he spoke to roughly 100 people to see how things went for them when they tried to sign up. Results: 0 for 100. Exit question: Could free smartphones be the answer? Update: The RNC piles on. ",

        "articles": "You may recall that earlier this year, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake was named President of the US Conference of Mayors for her outstanding work in serving the people of her city and demonstrating innovation in turning things around. As part of that process, she decided to summarily fire Police Commissioner Anthony Batts back in the beginning of July. To say the least, I expressed some reservations about the move, particularly considering that most of the questionable tactics employed by the cops during the Freddy Gray riots were handed down from City Hall. But who am I to second guess the Best Mayor in America? Maybe she’s on to something. Let’s check in and see. Baltimore reached a grim milestone on Friday, three months after riots erupted in response to the death of Freddie Gray in police custody: With 45 homicides in July, the city has seen more bloodshed in a single month than it has in 43 years. Police reported three deaths — two men shot Thursday and one on Friday. The men died at local hospitals. With their deaths, this year’s homicides reached 189, far outpacing the 119 killings by July’s end in 2014. Nonfatal shootings have soared to 366, compared to 200 by the same date last year. July’s total was the worst since the city recorded 45 killings in August 1972, according to The Baltimore Sun. The expert analysts weighing in on this subject on the city’s behalf are citing all manner of factors including distrust of the police, high unemployment, lack of opportunity and the rest of the usual political talking points. The cops, on the other hand, point out politically unfortunate factors such as turf wars between drug dealers and new, rising black markets fueled by a boatload of prescription pills looted from the pharmacy during the riots. Perched on a friend’s stoop, Sherry Moore, 55, said she knew “mostly all” of the young men killed recently in West Baltimore, including an 18-year-old fatally shot a half-block away. Moore said many more pills are on the street since the riot, making people wilder than usual. “The ones doing the violence, the shootings, they’re eating Percocet like candy and they’re not thinking about consequences. They have no discipline, they have no respect — they think this is a game. How many can I put down on the East side? How many can I put down on the West side?” How’s that community outreach thing going? From the sound of it, not all that great. CNN has done an interesting series of incognito interviews with members of the Baltimore Police force who didn’t wish to be identified but said that things are just a mess. (Some of the video can be viewed here.) The cops are increasingly afraid to do their jobs. They are facing an emboldened criminal class at the same time as they wonder if their leadership will have their backs if they take an aggressive stance against gang violence. I have to sympathize with them on that point. How quickly would you be running down an ally after an armed suspect if you knew that, in the event you had to shoot it out, the aftermath would be moderated on live television by Al Sharpton? Whatever Rawlings-Blake is doing in Baltimore isn’t working. Perhaps rather than blaming the cops on the beat or dreaming up new social interaction schemes, the city might look at asking her to step down and turn the job over to somebody capable of restoring some semblance of law and order in the streets.

        "articles": "Via Ace, Big Government’s Mike Flynn asks a very good question. During the 1995 shutdown, the Clinton Administration followed the OMB guidance issued during the Reagan Administration. The Obama Administration, it seems, is tacking a different direction. Let me be clear, the guidelines proposing to hold military paychecks are, according to the news reports, draft guidelines. It is possible the Obama Administration has abandoned these punitive guidelines. And, even if they implemented these guidelines, military personnel would most likely eventually receive their pay, once a budget agreement is reached. But, why even change the policy and subject our military to partisan political battles. The policy is certainly a change, but it doesn’t provide much hope. Hopefully, they will clear this up quickly. Read this CNN story or Air Force Times piece from last month for further background. If The One can continue payments to the military without having to agree to Boehner’s new short-term budget resolution, then why doesn’t he do it? Unless … he wants a shutdown to happen because it’ll hurt Republicans, and thinks that deliberately withholding military pay will make it that much more painful for Republicans politically when the shutdown comes. Is there any other explanation for this? There may have been some sort of legislation passed since 1995 tying the White House’s hands but I don’t see it mentioned in the CNN piece or the Federal Times story linked by Flynn and can’t find anything via Google. Speaking of Boehner’s resolution, it passed this afternoon 247-181. Fifteen Democrats voted yes and six Republicans voted no: Amash, Bachmann, Barton, Steve King, Mulvaney, and of course Ron Paul. That’s all that’s left of the 54 Republicans who voted no on Boehner’s last short-term budget because they were tired of messing around with two-week funding measures. Amazing what high-stakes negotiations can do for party unity. Below you’ll find video of Boehner and Reid after this afternoon’s failed meeting at the White House. They’re headed back there tonight for another go at 7 p.m., with Boehner now asking for cuts in the neighborhood of $39 billion and Democrats offering a package in the ballpark of $34-35 billion. A major caveat, though: In the case of the policy riders, Democrats said they have agreed to a number of the lesser Republican amendments. But there has been little give on the half-dozen highest priority items— impacting healthcare reform, family planning programs and the Federal Communications Commission’s “net-neutrality” rulemaking, for example. And Reid told Boehner that Republicans hurt their own cause this week by pushing for what proved to be a series of unsuccessful votes this week on the question of limiting the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to address global warming and greenhouse gases… When asked if there were riders Boehner would shut the government over, he said “We’re going to continue to work our way through all of this and there’s no reason to draw any lines in the sand to make this more difficult than it already is.” A fun fact about the GOP’s abortion rider to Boehner’s short-term budget, which appears to be the dealbreaker for Dingy and the rest of the gang: It hasn’t been a dealbreaker for liberals in the past. From John McCormack: This policy, known as the Dornan amendment, has previously enjoyed bipartisan support: Indeed, Reid, Biden, Pelosi, and Obama have all voted for appropriations bills that included the Dornan amendment. President Obama signed the Dornan amendment into law in the fiscal year 2009 budget. It was only removed in the summer of 2009 by House Democrats–and even then 39 Democratic members of Congress took the extraordinary step of joining House Republicans to try to take down the rule on an appropriations bill in order to keep the Dornan amendment. It’s quite amazing that Harry Reid and President Obama are now insisting that taxpayer-funding of abortion is more important than a bill that funds the troops for a year and keeps budget negotiations going for another week. Is it amazing? Democrats are also pretending tonight that it’s somehow outre to attach policy riders to budget bills at all, even though they’ve done it themselves many times in the past. Another budget update coming later, after tonight’s meeting. 30 hours from a shutdown… Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy Update: Aha, there is indeed an explanation for this. Military pay in 1995 wasn’t as simple as Clinton releasing the funds. There was a defense appropriations bill in effect during that shutdown. Via Gabe Malor, a report from the Congressional Research Service: A frequent question is how this compares to the last government shutdown in 1995-1996. There were two shutdowns at that time, one of five days, from November 13 through November 19, 1995, and one of 21 days, from December 15, 1995 through January 5, 1996. The first shutdown was not long enough to affect pay checks, and DOD was not affected by the second because defense appropriations were enacted on December 1, so funding was available. So it’s not The One’s fault that the military isn’t getting paid. (Well, it is insofar as he and Reid refuse to agree to Boehner’s new resolution, but it’s not solely his fault.) It’s actually … Reid’s and Pelosi’s fault for not passing a 2011 budget last year when they had a chance. The record stands corrected! ",

        "articles": "Via Politico… just wow. Welcome to Chicago, I suppose: Emanuel is sending letters to two major financial institutions, TD Bank and Bank of America, which offer lines of credit to gun makers suggesting that they stop lending money to the manufacturers if they don’t come out for new gun restrictions. “TD Bank currently aids the gun manufacturing industry through a $60 million revolving line of credit with Smith & Wesson, a gun manufacturer that produces the AR-15 — an assault weapon that was used by James Holmes to kill 12 people and wound 58 in a crowded movie theatre in Aurora,” Emanuel’s missive to TD CEO Bharat Masrani states. “I ask you to use your influence to push this company to find common ground with the vast majority of Americans who support a military weapons and ammunition ban and comprehensive background checks.” Noting that Chicago’s municipal employees and teachers had already divested money in pension funds from gun makers that are opposing new gun laws, the White House chief of staff-turned-mayor wrote: “Now we need you and other commercial banks to join this fight for safer streets. Collectively we can send a clear and unambiguous message to the entire gun industry that investors will no longer financially support companies that profit from gun violence.” Emanuel sent a similarly worded letter to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, a bank that does business with Sturm, Ruger & Co. Actually, I’m pretty sure that Sturm, Ruger & Co’s and Smith & Wesson’s profits don’t come from gun violence, but rather from the millions of law-abiding American citizens legally buying their completely legal products — and that includes military and law enforcement, I might add. And Emanuel is lobbying these major and publicly traded financial institutions to actively discriminate against law-abiding companies that don’t happen to support his entirely political gun-related agenda? A political agenda which, by the way, will not help to reduce violent crime? Would this even hold up in a court of law? It’s like they’re not even trying to hide the lobbying, cronyism, and corruption anymore. Kind of like someone else we all know over in Chicago-on-the-Potomac. ",

        "articles": "Isn’t it great that the Democrats passed that resolution about hate last week? You can see what a salutary effect it is having on Rep. Omar. Seriously though, the good news is that she didn’t make any comments about Jews. The bad news is that she’s broadened her rhetorical style to literally dehumanizing her political opponents, which doesn’t seem like a huge improvement. Here she is clarifying her comments comparing former President Obama to President Trump saying, “That is silly to even think and equate the two.” She continued, “One is human; the other is really not.” This stems from a story Politico published about Rep. Omar last week in which she appeared to attack Obama as “a pretty face” masking bad policies. Here’s the excerpt which raised some eyebrows: As she saw it, the party ostensibly committed to progressive values had become complicit in perpetuating the status quo. Omar says the “hope and change” offered by Barack Obama was a mirage. Recalling the “caging of kids” at the U.S.-Mexico border and the “droning of countries around the world” on Obama’s watch, she argues that the Democratic president operated within the same fundamentally broken framework as his Republican successor. “We can’t be only upset with Trump. … His policies are bad, but many of the people who came before him also had really bad policies. They just were more polished than he was,” Omar says. “And that’s not what we should be looking for anymore. We don’t want anybody to get away with murder because they are polished. We want to recognize the actual policies that are behind the pretty face and the smile.” Within hours, Omar was backtracking from that by claiming her words had been distorted. In a tweet last Friday, she wrote, “I’m an Obama fan” and she included a link to her own recording of the interview. That was apparently meant to prove her case, i.e. that her words had been distorted. There was just one problem: The audio recording confirmed she’d said exactly what Politico had claimed she did. The author of the Politico piece was just one of many people who noticed: Exhibit A of how politicians use the media as a straw man to avoid owning what they said. Your tape…supports what I wrote 100%. So does my longer tape. It's beyond dispute. Next time, a phone call from your office before the Twitter ambush would be appreciated.  — Tim Alberta (@TimAlberta) March 8, 2019 The next day, after being dunked on by hundreds of people, Rep. Omar deleted the tweet: Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) just deleted this tweet In an interview with Politico, she suggested that Obama was a murderer and made other attacks on him Omar then claimed she never said that and tweeted out an audio link of the interview The link showed she *did* say those things pic.twitter.com/GjmMvWefRe — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) March 9, 2019 So to sum this up: I’ll give her this much. After several tries, she finally landed on a target that her supporters won’t care about defending. Sure, she’s still lying about what she said in that interview, but the Democratic base will be happy to overlook that in exchange for a little Trump bashing. Things really are so much better now that the Democrats have rid the world of hate. Watch the latest video at foxnews.com ",

        "articles": "When I first saw this brief headline at Outside the Beltway I almost moved on because it sounded like such a silly premise. Is it ever okay for the President to lie? It’s a question that Doug Mataconis originally picked up from Dave Schuler. Clearly my gut reactions to questions aren’t always right, or at least in this case there might be a bit more to the question than meets the eye. First, Doug expands on the subject. The gut reaction of course is that it’s never okay for any elected official to lie to the American people. At the same time, though, it does kind of depend on what the definition of “lie” happens to be. Is it a lie to fail to disclose classified data that would embarrass the Administration, but which would also potentially place American intelligence agents and assets in danger? What if it was a lie that, if not spoken,would endanger national security? Schuler offers a pop quiz style selection of four possible answers: – Never – Whenever he feels it’s necessary—it’s one of the things he was elected to do – When lives are at stake – Some other circumstances? So my initial reaction was simply, “hell no.” But with even a few moments of thought the question became a little more complicated. So let’s find out where people stand on this, but first there should be a couple of ground rules which could help prevent at least some muddying of the waters. Being wrong is not the same thing as lying. The term lying implies an intention to deceive. Saying something you believe to be true which later proves to be incorrect is not lying. Incorrect predictions are not lies. We can eliminate any statements made which involve things which have not yet happened. You can claim that “raising taxes on the rich will solve our nation’s economic problems” and not be lying. You’ll probably turn out to be hilariously inaccurate, but you weren’t lying. Generalizations and outrageous opinions are not lies. You are free to say that liberals hate America or that conservatives hate poor people and minorities if you wish. You probably won’t be taken very seriously, but it doesn’t pass muster as a “lie.” So let’s restrict this to statements about past events or existing conditions which the speaker can rationally be demonstrated to have knowledge of. Of course we expect – or at least wish for – honesty and transparency from our president. But are there exceptions to that rule? The first one that comes to mind is in the case of operational secrets regarding military action or intelligence operatives. I suppose an answer of “no comment” would be more honest, but I can also imagine times where you would want to throw off the enemy by engaging in a disinformation campaign. You can always clear the air later with the American people and explain why you did it. But, as Doug asks, what if it’s a lie for political convenience? How about lies regarding personal, private behavior unrelated to the job? (So, you “did not have sexual relations with that woman.” Okie dokey.) What if it’s just something that you’re embarrassed about but which doesn’t substantively affect anyone else? Let’s put it to a vote, but we’ll change Dave’s options a bit. Is it ever okay for the President to lie? ",

        "articles": "If a Trump SuperPAC was exposed inciting violence at Hillary rallies, do you think the media would cover it? The question answers itself, doesn’t it? Yet the latest bombshell videos from James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas have been reduced to “kid on a milk carton” status by network news outlets and most of the cable news networks. This despite the fact that two of the high-ranking operatives featured in the videos have been removed from their positions due to the fall-out surrounding the investigation. At Hot Air, we covered the first video here Monday, and here is the second video which was released Tuesday afternoon: In this second video, Democrat operatives are seen and heard plotting outright voter fraud… you know, like rigging an election: Several Project Veritas Action undercover journalists catch Scott Foval, the National Field Director for Americans United for Change, saying, “we’ve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin’ assholes [Republicans] for fifty years and we’re not going to stop now, we’re just going to find a different way to do it.” One of the highest-level operatives for the DNC who admits to being “no white knight” said that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years. Foval then goes on to explain the sinister plot and how they avoid getting caught. The undercover reporter asks why they can’t just “bus in” voters, but get them to use their own personal vehicles. Foval describes how they avoid being detected and free of criminal charges. “Would they charge each individual of voter fraud? Or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy, which they could prove? It’s one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars. If there’s a bus involved? That changes the dynamic.” Tuesday’s fallout was centered on the first video which showed Democrat operatives Scott Foval, National Field Director for Americans United for Change, bragging about how his organization deliberately incited violence at and outside Trump rallies to build a media narrative that Trump supporters were inherently violent. Foval has been removed from his position: (Hannity) “Americans United for Change has always operated according to the highest ethical standards. Scott Foval is no longer associated with Americans United for Change.” . @woodhouseb It really doesn't look like @AU4Change \"operates according to the highest ethical and legal standards.\" @seanhannity #Veritas pic.twitter.com/Z8nFA4fgUg — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 18, 2016 The video also featured Robert Creamer, husband of Rep. Jan Schakowski (D-IL) and a frequent guest of the Obama White House. In fact, according to research done by The Daily Caller, Creamer has visited the White House over 340 times since Obama took residence. Creamer is seen on the video bragging about the operations of his organization, Democracy Partners. “Wherever Trump and Pence are going to be, we have events and we have a whole team across the country that does that both consultants and people from the Democratic Party,” Creamer told an investigator. “And the Democratic Party apparatus and the people from the campaign, the Clinton campaign and my role with the campaign, is to manage all that.” How does Creamer fit in with the dirty operations Foval brags about? We learned exactly how from Foval’s own lips: “I am contracted to him [Bob Creamer],” says Foval to an undercover reporter. “But I answer to the head of Special Events for the DNC and the head of special events and political for the campaign.” “The [Clinton] campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes the shit…” continued Foval. “Democracy Partners is the tip of the spear on that stuff.” And late yesterday, Creamer announced he was stepping down so as not to be a “distraction.” BREAKING News: Bob Creamer, top @HillaryClinton campaign advisor, \"STEPS DOWN\" after today's video. Here is part of his statement.. pic.twitter.com/oH4VEVQS5c — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 18, 2016 So, at a time when the mainstream media, Democrat politicians and high ranking Republicans are chastising Donald Trump for suggesting the political system in America is rigged, you would think a series of undercover videos showing evidence of a rigged political system might actually be newsworthy. However, going into Tuesday’s prime time news coverage, the story was relegated to the blogosphere, social media and talk radio. In an exclusive interview with Hot Air, O’Keefe told me this morning: “Bob Creamer visited the White House 340 times. Why the hell isn’t the press covering this video?” Indeed as of this writing, it appears only James Rosen at Fox News and Anderson Cooper at CNN have run packages on the Project Veritas investigation: I'm live on #KellyFile @megynkelly at 9:30p on the latest videos from @Project_Veritas @JamesOKeefeIII. Two Dem operatives have been axed. — James Rosen (@JamesRosenTV) October 19, 2016 Dem operative 'stepping back' after video suggests group incited violence at Trump rallies   — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) October 19, 2016 Plus the O’Reilly and Hannity shows featured extended discussions about the videos and the fall out including former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich telling Hannity, “The FBI should be opening an investigation into these people right now.” So despite both videos trending at the top of YouTube’s rankings the virtual media blackout continues. That could change tonight though. All it would take is a mention of the rigged system narrative from moderator Chris Wallace during the presidential debate. Will he raise the topic? He certainly should. If a string of women making accusations without any evidence about Donald Trump’s alleged inappropriate conduct rises to the level of wall-to-wall coverage, surely the kind of behavior caught on video resulting n the removal of two major Democrat operatives should get a mention or two, right?

        "articles": "By now you’ve already heard about the “backlash” being directed toward the entire state of Indiana over the recent passage of their new religious freedom law. The NCAA is hinting about moving their basketball tournament away. They might even lose their comic book convention. (How much of a “loss” that would be is subjective.) But one of the more interesting threats being made comes from the CEO of online review site Yelp. Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman isn’t happy. He penned an open letter on Thursday bashing Indiana’s new religious freedom bill, railing against “laws that would allow for business to discriminate against consumers based on certain traits including sexual orientation.” The Yelp executive didn’t stop with voicing his displeasure, though. He further hinted that he couldn’t see how he could create, maintain, or expand a significant business presence in Indiana or any other state which instituted such policies. In case that requires translation, he’s saying that he will happily punish everyone in the state by removing or intentionally avoiding the creation of jobs. Isn’t that just a positive, helpful message to send? But if Mr. Stoppelman can’t be associated with businesses which “discriminate” based on certain traits, then one of the core functions of his own business comes into question. Some of the most popular reviews on Yelp are for restaurants, particularly high end ones where diners expect to pay a hefty price but receive top end quality in return. What’s the problem there? Well, many of those eateries have dress codes for the dinner hour and will turn away people who don’t adhere. Also, restaurants are well within their rights to set a specific dress code and require guests to follow it. If the restaurant is black tie, and you arrive in a t-shirt and jeans, expect them to ignore you. The dress code is considered part of the restaurant’s ambience, and is legally protected. In short, dressing to meet the classification is considered a choice. If you choose to eat at the restaurant, then you must choose to dress appropriately. But how should we interpret this in the current era of political correctness? If you are turning away those who are not well dressed, they most likely fall into one category of those people of certain traits, specifically those who can’t afford dressy clothes. And in most cities, which people are most likely to be economically disadvantaged? Minorities! So, by the rule of the transitive property, dress codes are discriminatory against minorities so the restaurant owners are racists. Right? So why does Yelp allow people to write reviews for them? It’s a categorically stupid argument, but I’ve heard far worse being argued in the name of political correctness. The fact is that the Indiana law is going to wind up being an important milestone for civil liberties no matter which way it goes in the end. We have a situation where activists are claiming that some form of discrimination exists against one subset of people (gays) and are perfectly willing to trample of the rights of another, less politically popular group of people (Christians) if it achieves their long term goals. Passing a law intended to correct this imbalance is setting people’s hair on fire in the usual circles, but it’s going to prove to be an instructive test case. Beyond all of this, however, I have to feel a bit disappointed that the debate ever had to be constructed as one of religious liberty in the first place. True, the religious liberty aspect of it is an important one and the courts need to speak to it. But underneath it all we’re talking about the freedom of private business owners to conduct their business as they see fit. The hard core libertarian argument which underpins this rests on the fact that a private business can’t actually “discriminate” against you in the same fashion that the government can. For one example, the state can’t pass a law refusing to issue a driver’s license to black motorists. The state holds an absolute monopoly on licenses and the black motorist can’t simply go down the street to Bob’s House of Discount Licenses and get one there. But a wedding cake is no different than any other food item once you remove the gay marriage element from the equation. Businesses who decide to refuse service to various people will be subject to the same market forces which always apply. If there is a market for any given goods or services and one owner chooses not to capitalize on that market, another will move in to fill the vacuum. If you refuse too many customers you will eventually go out of business, but that’s the nature of the business world. Sadly, the courts stopped defending the idea of free markets in cases where political correctness manages to stick its nose under the edge of the tent many decades ago. But the religious liberty aspect of this case gives it additional legs, so it won’t be batted aside as easily. ",

        "articles": "The three or four fiscal conservatives left in the House aren’t going to like that. Mark Meadows, head of the Freedom Caucus, urged Trump to keep the two bills separate a few days ago: Meadows, who leads a group of hard-liners that has frequently frustrated House Republican leaders, said attaching Harvey aid to a debt-ceiling increase would be a “terrible idea” that would be “conflating two very different issues.” “The Harvey relief would pass on its own, and to use that as a vehicle to get people to vote for a debt ceiling is not appropriate,” he said in an interview. “That sends all the wrong message: ‘Let’s go ahead and increase the debt ceiling, and by the way, while we’re doing it let’s go ahead and spend another $15, $20 billion?’ “Why would we do a clean bill with a Republican president?” wondered Dave Brat. Use the debt-ceiling hike as leverage for spending cuts! Trump’s not much interested in smaller government even under the best of circumstances, though, and he’s really not interested when FEMA needs billions to drain the literal swamp that the Texas gulf coast has become. Watch below and you’ll see Mnuchin counter Meadows’s point: The debt ceiling and Harvey aid are connected because the emergency spending will push up the timetable for default. If Congress appropriates $8 billion for Harvey now, they’ll have even less time before the end of the month to negotiate a debt-ceiling hike. Do both while you have the chance. The way this is going to happen, I assume, is with a standalone vote on Harvey relief aid in the House followed by the Senate attaching a debt-ceiling hike to that bill and then sending it back to the House for passage. That way the Freedom Caucus will get to vote yes on the standalone bill, affirming their support for Harvey relief, before voting no on the Senate bill as a protest against a debt-ceiling hike without spending cuts or fiscal reforms. The Senate bill should pass the House overwhelmingly anyway thanks to Democratic support. As of Friday night, Paul Ryan was planning a vote on a standalone bill, but OMB director Mick Mulvaney sent him a letter emphasizing that the new spending will shrink the window for raising the debt ceiling and could put essential services at risk. Mulvaney has all sorts of cred as a fiscal conservative, which may give some reluctant House Republicans cover to vote for a Harvey/debt-ceiling package. House GOPers from Texas, although fiscally conservative, will also swallow hard and support the package for obvious reasons. Ryan should have no problem passing it without the Freedom Caucus. And if they’re going to kill two birds with one stone, why not … three birds with one stone? Congress needs to fund the government before the end of the month to avert a shutdown; shutdowns are always unpopular but a shutdown during federal relief efforts in Texas would be especially hard to spin. They could tack on a funding package for the entire government as part of the Harvey/debt-ceiling bill and deal with the whole mess all at once. Trump himself has threatened to veto a spending bill that doesn’t include funding for the border wall, but according to Bloomberg the White House has privately made clear to congressional leaders that he’s willing to postpone that fight until December, when the next shutdown threat looms. The president’s prepared to sacrifice one of his signature priorities (for a few months) in order to show that the feds are on the case in Harvey clean-up and operating at full tilt. His base isn’t happy about it, though, and using Harvey relief as an end-around fiscal conservatives in the House in order to raise the debt ceiling and fund the government with no concessions on spending would be a lot for small-government fans to swallow. Mnuchin is asked about a shutdown here as well and is more equivocal than he is about the debt ceiling — but he does note that Trump’s top priority at the moment is the people of Texas. Hmmm. ",

        "articles": "Yesterday we discussed the announcement from the White House which set forth new restrictions on issuing excess military equipment to local police forces. At the time I reached the following conclusion: This is a public relations stunt to show that they are “on the side of the people” against the evil, out of control cops. Unfortunately we still have areas in this country – generally in large urban centers or contested border regions in the southwest – where police work can border on combat zone scenarios. Everyone would prefer it to be otherwise, but if you’re living in the real world you need to bring the best tools available to the job you have in front of you. It seems that I wasn’t the only one holding that particular suspicion. The Fraternal Order of Police has come down hard on the Obama administration and they are voicing essentially the same concerns, if somewhat more politely stated. The nation’s largest police union is fighting back against a White House plan to restrict local police forces’ ability to acquire military-style gear, accusing President Barack Obama’s task force of politicizing officers’ safety. The White House on Monday announced that bayonets, weaponized vehicles and grenade launchers will no longer be available to local police and that other equipment such as riot gear and other types of armored vehicles would be subject to a more onerous approval process… James Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, told POLITICO on Monday that he hopes to have a White House meeting as soon as Tuesday to discuss his concerns about how the plans could put cops at risk. He said in particular he objects to a measure that would require police departments to get permission from city governments to acquire certain equipment, including riot batons, helmets and shields, through federal programs… “We need to only look back to Baltimore to see what happens when officers are sent out ill-equipped in a disturbance situation,” he said. “Because you don’t like the optics, you can’t send police officers out to be hurt or killed.” It sound like Pasco is concerned over the same distinctions I raised questions about yesterday. There are shades of gray in this discussion, because a grenade launcher is a fairly serious hammer to bring against any nail and the use of one in a riot situation could result in all sorts of collateral damage, particularly in the hands of someone without full military training in its use. But seeing batons, shield and helmets on the list of things which might even be questioned should have anyone’s hackles raised. The FOP is focusing on Baltimore at the moment, which is understandable because the events are fresh in the minds of the public. But the many nights of gunfire, Molotov cocktails and bricks flying through the air in Ferguson are probably a more apt example. We saw a microcosm of this confrontation in New York City when the mayor there found himself facing the backs of most of his police force. He was perceived – with great justification in my eyes – as taking the side of the lawless against the law enforcers in the name of quelling an uprising and, most likely, scoring political points with a key electoral demographic. But the cops on the street – with very few, post-retirement exceptions – are not running for office. They can’t afford to worry about what the polls say next week. They are charged with maintaining the rule of law, providing order and safety for the lawful, and still finding a way to make it home safely to their families each night. Politicizing something so fundamental to the future and security of the nation is callous, reckless and self-serving. The executive branch of the civilian government – at all levels – owes it to their law enforcement entities to provide them support unless individual members are found to have gone rogue and stepped outside the law. Sweeping policies such as the one under discussion here help nobody except those seeking to foment violence. ",

        "articles": "For weeks, my esteemed colleague Ed Morrissey has predicted late-breaking wave that would carry a number of Republicans into office, even a few the party gave up on months ago. As the final week of the campaign beings, that wave is breaking and Republican candidates for Senate are surging almost across the board. On Sunday, NBC News released new data from a variety of races. NBC News/Marist surveyed the electoral landscape in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, South Dakota, and North Carolina and they found, universally, that the political winds are at the Republicans’ backs. In states there Senate seats that Republicans need to take control of or hold in order to secure a majority – Kansas, South Dakota, and Arkansas – Republicans have reason for relief this morning. NBC/Marist polled Kansas and found Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) trailing his independent-slash-Democratic opponent, Greg Orman, by a statistically negligible 44 to 45 percent. Why is that cause for Republicans to celebrate? In their last poll, taken from September 27 to October 1, Roberts trailed Orman by 10 points – 38 to 48 percent. While Orman still remains the more likable candidate in this race and he leads among independent voters by a whopping 34 points, NBC/Marist suggest that the Republican Party is doing the job it needs to do: Branding Orman as a Democrat. Robert’s challenger’s unfavorability rating is up 11 points their last survey, nearly mirroring the collapse of his topline numbers. Barack Obama’s job approval rating in Kansas is a mere 35 points. In South Dakota, a state in which Democrats invested seven figures late in the campaign cycle as polls supposedly showed GOP Gov. Mike Rounds losing steam in a three-way race against the Democrat and a former Republican campaigning as a Democrat. That was money not well spent, according to NBC/Marist. Rounds secures 43 percent of the vote in a three-way race against Democrat Rick Weiland (29 percent) and former GOP Senator-turned-“friend of Obama” Larry Pressler (16 percent). In Arkansas, the race is far tighter. Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR) leads Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) by just two points, a statistical tie and tighter than NBC/Marist’s poll in the field in the first week of September which showed Cotton leading Pryor by 5 points. But the Real Clear Politics average of polls puts Cotton up over the incumbent by 5.5 percent, and the trends show both candidates gaining support at a commensurate rate as undecided voters tune into the election. If that trend holds until November, it will be hard for Pryor to catch up to Cotton’s lead. Moreover, Cotton remains favorably viewed by a plurality of Arkansas while Pryor is viewed negatively by a near majority of the state’s electorate (49 percent). If the GOP wins in these states, and does not lose (either on November 4 or in ensuing runoff races) in states like Kentucky and Georgia, a prospect handicappers would probably not bet heavy against, they will be well positioned to take the Senate. The GOP needs to secure wins in states where they are currently favored — West Virginia, Louisiana, and Alaska — to take the 6 seats they need for a bare majority. But NBC/Marist polled a few other races, and the GOP has a chance to open up other avenues through which they could take a Senate majority. In Colorado, Sen. Mark Udall’s (D-CO) collapse in the polls continues apace. In NBC/Marist’s poll in the field from September 2 to 4, the Democratic incumbent led Rep. Cory Gardner (R-CO) by 6 points with 28 to 42 percent. Today, NBC/Marist found a shift toward Gardner of 7 points. The GOP senatorial nominee in the Centennial State now leads his opponent by a point at 46 to 45 percent. In Iowa, state Sen. Joni Ernst is breaking away. NBC/Maris found Ernst leading Rep. Bruce Braley (D-IA) by 49 to 46 percent. In September, she led her opponent by just 46 to 44 percent. Again, both candidates are gaining undecided support as marginal voters begin to tune into the election at a commensurate pace, but that is bad news for Braley who needs to make up some lost ground. NBC/Marist found that the gender gap in the Hawkeye State has narrowed to a point that would be difficult for any Democratic candidate to overcome – Ernst leads among men by 12 points but only trails among women by 5 points, down from 11 points in their last poll. But it was NBC’s last finding that was its most interesting. A wave election can take with it some flotsam that was never thought likely to make it to shore but ends up benefiting from the natural momentum of its environment. That looks to be happening in North Carolina. There, state House Speaker Thom Tillis, who has consistently trailed Sen. Kay Hagan (D-NC) in the polls, the race is now tied at exactly 43 percent. In September, Hagan led Tillis by 4 points, 44 to 40 percent. Moreover, NBC/Marist found that libertarian candidate Sean Haugh, who runs on a platform which advocates for “more weed, less war,” is picking up an unlikely 7 percent of the vote. Voters are almost always more predisposed to tell pollster they back a third-party candidate than they are to actually cast a vote for one. NBC found that North Carolina voters are not fond of any of the candidates on the ballot this cycle, but Hagan has higher negatives (48 percent) than Tillis (44 percent). Barack Obama, meanwhile, enjoys a 38 percent job approval rating in the Tar Heel State. Democrats’ hopes for blunting a GOP wave rest in the unlikely prospect that states like Georgia will go blue on the night of November 4, despite the fact that it remains a conservative state and 2014 is clearly a Republican year. The majority party also firmly believes that intangibles like the party’s “ground game,” or the Bannock Street operation which is aimed at generating presidential-year levels of turnout among minorities, will rescue the party from utter defeat. That is possible, and there are other factors, like Colorado’s mailing of a ballot to every voter in the state, which could increase marginal voter participation, that could buoy the state’s sinking Democrats. What NBC/Marist found is that all of these races save the South Dakota Senate contest are within the margins of error and are statistically tied. The race for control of the Senate could not be any closer heading to the final campaign week. What NBC/Marist also found, however, was a universal shift in momentum toward Republican candidates and away from Democrats and the independents who would caucus with them if elected. A late-breaking wave is cresting. While Democrats expect a few surprises in their favor on election night, Republicans are just as likely to enjoy a surprise victory or two if these conditions continue to develop. ",

        "articles": "The best 13 minutes of his campaign, and compulsively watchable despite the length because of how sincere he seems. But where was this guy two nights ago at the debate? The newsiest bit comes from 7:45 to around 10:00 when he’s asked about his pledge to support the nominee. If you’re so bothered by what Trump’s doing, a reporter asks, why’d you reaffirm on Thursday night that you’ll back him? Rubio’s answer is pedestrian — I stand by that, although it’s getting harder every day — but his tone isn’t. He’s almost speechless for a second; his voice nearly cracks. He seems legitimately anguished, even to stalwart Rubio critics. I think he stood by the pledge out of expedience, to avoid being criticized for breaking a promise on the eve of the big vote in Florida, and now it’s reached the point where he can’t justify it to himself morally. He chose self-interest over conscience and he can’t reconcile it. He’s going to break his pledge eventually, though. Trumpism and the left’s anti-Trumpist reaction will only get worse en route to November. Watch to the end if you can spare the time, as that’s when he starts talking, incisively, about Trump’s M.O. That also explains some of the anguish here, I’m sure. This guy thought he was going to lead a party that was fundamentally conservative. Now, not only is he coming to grips with the reality that he’s not going to lead it, he’s trying to cope with the fact that whatever it’s become, it’s not conservative. As for the fiasco last night in Chicago, Jazz is a thousand percent right: Trump had every right to hold that rally without leftist goons forcing him offstage. The heckler’s veto is immoral when jihadis exercise it against critics of Islam and it’s immoral when SJWs exercise it against Trump. Before we crown him America’s new free-speech martyr, though, never forget that his own opinion about heckler’s vetoes hasn’t always been so clear. Remember what happened last year when two Islamist scumbags tried to attack Pam Geller’s Mohammed cartoon contest?  He didn’t just say that on Twitter, either. Trump cares about his right to speak free of intimidation, not yours. Look surprised. ",

        "articles": "Strange, is it not? The city can’t seem to use the ridiculous amount of tax money they scoop up in Los Angeles to, say, fix potholes and provide basic services competently. But they can come after a 10-year-old tree house. Oh, boy, can they. Take it away, Steve Lopez, and thank you for giving this some ink in the L.A. Times: On May 22, a diligent public servant at Los Angeles City Hall wrote a letter to a Venice homeowner about the treehouse that’s been in her yard for 10 years. And you just know, don’t you, that a story with this beginning will not have a happy ending?… The owner of the well-maintained treehouse is Eileen Erickson. She lives on a Venice walk street not all that far from a neighborhood I wrote about recently in which residents spent years begging the city to repave their horribly potholed streets, only to be told that they would have to pay to fix their own curbs first. So you can understand Erickson’s surprise and frustration when she opened the letter from the city’s Department of Building and Safety and read through two pages of bureaucratic gibberish identifying no fewer than 17 code violations. She was ordered to “demolish” the treehouse or face thousands of dollars in fines and possible imprisonment. “Everyone thinks it’s ludicrous, given the many problems in the city,” Erickson wrote to her council office at one point during her ongoing nightmare. She noted in that correspondence that she gathered hundreds of signatures from neighbors hoping to save the treehouse, which has been treasured by many children. Let’s talk about the fines, shall we? That’s what this is about—squeezing a little more revenue out of law-abiding citizens instead of doing work for the community worthy of the exorbitant amount of money they’re already extracting. So, how much might they bleed Mrs. Erickson for? “An inspection has revealed that the property … is in violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code sections listed below,” it said, adding that Eileen would be charged $356.16 for the inspection and could be in for thousands of additional dollars in permit fees and penalties, if not imprisonment… She has since spent countless mind-numbing hours trying to get hold of city officials, visiting city offices, trying to decipher municipal codes and having more than a few emails and phone calls ignored… Erickson said she is reluctantly willing to pay a $3,500 fee for a variance, but there would be no guarantee that her problems would end with that. Based on her research, she suspects another reason the city might swing a wrecking ball is that the treehouse — and the trees, which were there long before she and Sid arrived on the scene — are too close to a public right of way that takes pedestrians along the walk street. Well, that would put her $4,000 in without any assurances that she’d be able to keep the tree house and no idea when the problem might actually be resolved either way. The tree house can’t possibly be described as any sort of eyesore. It’s a beautifully constructed bamboo structure that looks like Tarzan meets mid-century modern chic. And, as most tree houses do, it has sentimental value to the family and the neighborhood. The man who built it was a veteran who bonded with Eileen’s late husband while working at the house, and Eileen has hosted neighborhood book clubs and community kids in the tree house over the years. Here in the D.C. area, an Iraq vet fought a similar fight over the beautiful treehouse he built for his sons to fulfill a promise he made while away on his combat tour. Thankfully, he won that battle but it took a national media campaign and the father in question, Mark Grapin, happened to be perfectly suited to a national media blitz— an honorable public servant, a well-spoken man with a near-flawless natural sense of how to talk to the press. “So my whole deployment, I must have made hundreds of sketches,” he said. “What can I do to fulfill my promise to build a tree house? We’ve got two great trees we can put a tree house in.” Grapin learned early in the project he didn’t need a building permit for a tree house and he got to work. Then he got the notice. Someone anonymously brought the tree house to the zoning board’s attention. Call me crazy, but you shouldn’t need a compelling personal narrative and what amounts to the skills commensurate with a ton of media training to build a tree house. But this happens all the time, thanks to a combination of overbearing regulation, overzealous regulators, and neighborhood narcs happy to turn in their fellow property owners. Sadly, this is the kind of thing that flourishes when your government is big, unaccountable, thirsty for all yo money, and protected from punishment by a nearly 100 percent liberal electorate. I’m hoping for the best for Erickson, but I can’t say I’m terribly optimistic. ",

        "articles": "The Obama administration long ago cultivated a sense among its defenders that lingering American racism inspires most of its critics, but it was Obama’s supporters in the press who elevated the practice of accusing conservatives of racial animus to farcical virtuosity. It was Obama’s boosters in the liberal blogosphere, many of whom found microphones for their agitation on networks like MSNBC, who invented the art of detecting “dog whistle” racism. For those unfamiliar, this is the ability to decode supposed appeals to racial solidarity that only a professional can ascertain. While these coded claims are rarely perceived by their alleged targets, they are easily identified by our modern augurs. The instinct among Obama supporters to invent imagined racism and denounce it with a fervor equal to that of the inquisitors evolved into parody during the 2012 election. Words like “golf,” “apartment”, “Chicago,” and “urban” became synonyms for African-Americans and for President Obama, thus rendering any subject of discussion including those words base and scornful. As is the carnival barker’s wont, the sequel to this act had to be even grander, more spectacular than the last. So words like “PGA tour,” “angry,” “kitchen cabinet,” and “IRS” were added to the mix of words which only a professional “dog whistle” detector could assess to be signals designed to activate imagined white supremacist sleeper cells. It was former Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Karen Finney who insisted that “welfare” must join the ranks of banned words with a racially tinged history. “Study after study has shown, very recently even, that Americans – we tend to associate welfare programs with black people,” Finney said at the time. “So, if you didn’t know that, then shame on you. If you did know that, then shame on you.” “What the Republicans are doing is diabolically clever,” practiced Washington Post racism decoder Jonathan Capehart agreed. “They are, I believe, playing subliminally to racial fears and racial resentments.” In a display which resulted in his firing, former Politico reporter Joe Williams and a contributor with NBC’s The Grio insisted that conservative commentators who dare mention the name of Obama’s former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, were the modern equivalent of the Klan. “It’s a claxon. It’s an air raid siren. It’s a call to arms,” Williams insisted. MSNBC host Chris Matthews outdid the lot when he suggested the fact that Obama even drew an opponent in 2012 was a disturbing indication of the country’s, and Mitt Romney’s, racial anxiety. The reelection of the president did not quiet the insistence that racism exists today in forms undetectable to those who are not trained mediums, but liberals have made such a joke of this practice that only a narrow audience of true believers still enjoy the performance. A recent Pew Research Center poll revealed that only 27 percent of the public believes racial discrimination is the “main reason why blacks can’t get ahead.” That figure is inflated by the fact that 80 percent of “solid liberals” agreed with this assertion – 49 points greater than any other group within the Democratic coalition. What’s more is that this playact is losing its novelty. When public figures make unquestionably racially tinged statements, the usual cast of characters who are our trained racism detectors display a transparent fear for their livelihoods. In the wake of racially insensitive comments made by former LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling and Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, Capehart, one of the most accomplished “dog whistle” decoders, warned that calling out this manner of overt, obvious racial rhetoric was less valuable than the work he does. “The harder reaction to have and the harder conversation to have is with our friends, and co-workers, and strangers, frankly, about all of the little — the small, the more nuanced ways racism rears its ugly head,” he added, résumé in hand. It is in this light that recent comments made by Attorney General Eric Holder, the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, should be viewed. Holder, who recently implied in a speech before an audience of African-American supporters that Republicans in Congress treated him as harshly as they would any other official in the Obama administration because of his skin color, fanned the flames of racial hatred again in a recent interview with ABC News. Asked about a statement he made years ago when he said America was a “nation of cowards” on the issue of race, Holder defended his remarks. “I think we are still a nation that is too afraid to confront racial issues,” he said. The attorney general lamented that it is rare to witness engagement “across the color line [to] talk about racial issues.” He did little to acknowledge his own role in that condition, exemplified by an comment he made minutes before in which he implied that some who oppose him and the president are racists. “There’s a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that’s directed at me [and] directed at the president,” Holder told ABC. “You know, people talking about taking their country back. I can’t look into people’s hearts, look into people’s minds, but it seems to me that this president has been treated differently than others… There’s a certain racial component to this for some people. I don’t think this is the thing that is a main driver, but for some there’s a racial animus.” For most, this is a joke. The meme that the bipartisan notion of “taking the country back” is somehow racist was long ago debunked. As the brief history lesson above demonstrates, however, no one is listening to this nonsense beyond the cult of true believers. Those for who racism is a religion – ubiquitous and unfalsifiable – nod in agreement at Holder’s self-aggrandizement. All others roll their eyes. It is natural and right to be incensed over the attorney general’s statement here, but a 30,000 foot view suggests there is even more reason to take heart in his remarks. Only those liberals Democrats the party desperately needs to turn out in the fall are inspired by this rhetoric; that desperate need is met with increasingly desperate tactics. A glance at the polls suggests it will not be successful. American comity and continuously improving race relations are stronger than one presidency, no matter how committed it is to tearing the country apart. ",

        "articles": "The San Franciso Chronicle published a story Saturday about the city’s “safe sites” for drug dealers. Officially there aren’t any such sites but unofficially, police say it’s almost impossible to get convicted of drug dealing in parts of the city, including the Tenderloin. In fact, parts of the city have become an open-air drug market, drawing in dealers from other parts of the city because of the sense that there are places where the law isn’t being enforced very stringently: “It’s almost impossible to get convicted in this city,” said [Sgt. Kevin] Healy, who works in the Police Department’s narcotics division. “The message needs to be sent that it’s not OK to be selling drugs. It’s not allowed anywhere else. Where else can you walk up to someone you don’t know and purchase crack and heroin? Is there such a place?”… Police say drug dealers from the East Bay ride BART into San Francisco every day to prey on the addicts slumped on our sidewalks, and yet the city that claims to so desperately want to help those addicts often looks the other way. You can walk through the Tenderloin, Civic Center, South of Market and the Mission and easily spot men handing over little plastic baggies with drugs in exchange for cash like it’s no big thing. In broad daylight. In front of pedestrians. Even in front of police… I walked with Officer Brian Donohue, who works out of Northern Station, around Van Ness Avenue, Polk Street and parts of the Tenderloin on a recent afternoon. Unlike so many of our city leaders, it’s clear Donohue is really trying to combat the problem. He’s worked with Healy and his partner, Officer Calvin Wang, to build cases against a raft of drug dealers, almost none of whom has a San Francisco address. He called the Tenderloin and surrounding neighborhoods “an open-air narcotics market” where dealers wrap drugs in plastic so they can easily swallow them if they see police. One result of this open-air drug market is a lot of addicts living on the streets. San Francisco’s new Mayor, London Breed, is committed to dealing with the rampant homeless problem but doesn’t seem to have any plan for making a crackdown on the dealers whose product ensures the addicts remain on the street. She tells the Chronicle, “What I’m trying to do is offer some individuals who are selling drugs an alternative.” Here’s an alternative offer: Stop selling drugs or we’ll put you in prison. That doesn’t seem to be an option. San Francisco recently got a shock when a major medical convention decided it would stop returning to the city because of the conditions in the streets. A city that survives on tourism (which brings in $9 billion a year), can’t afford to lose deals like that which bring in $40 million in a week. But the response so far has been to plan for more bathrooms and a new poop patrol to deal with the people who don’t make it to the bathrooms. The city isn’t going to make major improvements in reducing homelessness so long as one of the major drivers of the problem (drug addiction) has a free reign in parts of the city. Until the city gets serious about shutting down the drug markets, things are going to keep getting worse for people hooked on the poison the dealers are selling and for the city itself. ",

        "articles": "You won’t believe me until you click play but this is much worse than Perry’s brain lock at the debate last week. Perry lost his train of thought; Cain doesn’t have a train at all here, to the point where he needs confirmation from the interviewer of what Obama’s position on Libya actually was. Eventually he produces some boilerplate about not supporting the opposition until you’re sure who’s in it and of course not making a decision as president until he has all the information, which is a standard Cain fallback talking point whenever he gets in trouble on a question, but the first two minutes or so are pure agony. The board actually took pity on him, I think, by not following up. Imagine if they’d asked his opinion on Obama’s decision to ignore the War Powers Act. Remember, this is a guy who apparently wants to be considered for secretary of defense. And that still only barely qualifies as the worst answer he gave today. Here’s what he told them when asked, predictably enough, about Scott Walker’s righteous crusade against public employee unions: On the issue of collective bargaining, Cain said he supported the right of public employees to bargain collectively. “But not collective hijacking. What I mean by that, if they have gotten so much for so many years and it’s going to bankrupt the state, I don’t think that’s good. It appears that in some instances, they really don’t care.”… In an interview with the Journal Sentinel last month, Cain said that he was “right in the corner of Gov. Scott Walker 100%” in Walker’s battle with public employee unions. Cain also appeared to be unclear on the issue of collective bargaining as it involves federal employees. Asked if he thought federal employees should have the ability to bargain collectively, Cain said: “They already have it, don’t they?” Told they didn’t, he said, “They have unions.” His candidacy’s now basically an experiment to see if there’s anything he could say about policy that grassroots conservatives wouldn’t ignore/forgive in the name of nominating a candidate who’s “authentic” instead of some slick RINO Beltway insider phony (many of whom at least oppose collective bargaining for PEUs). Is there anything? Or can any screw-up be dismissed so long as it’s “clarified” a few hours later, knowing full well that undecideds won’t be as forgiving if he pulls something like this in a debate against Obama? How steep is the authenticity grading curve here, exactly? I was going to give you the clip of Bialek’s ex-boyfriend claiming today that she told him back in 1997 that Cain had done something inappropriate, but most of you will find this more important. (You can watch that vid here.) His polls have already started to slide from the allegations — Doug Schoen’s latest survey finds 53 percent believe the harassment charges are true, with independents splitting 46/27, and Politico’s new battleground poll finds his support among likely Republican voters cut in half in the span of eight days. So maybe none of this much matters anymore, except of course to Newt Gingrich. ",

        "articles": "Like the man said, he’s got a pen and a phone and he’s not going to wait around for the legislature just because the law says he has to. It used to be that O reserved his executive power grabs for matters on which Congress was deadlocked, or simply wasn’t moving fast enough for his liking. Not always, of course: Congress duly enacted the ObamaCare employer mandate that he suspended, but that likely would have produced deadlock if he had asked Congress to suspend it instead, which, I guess, in Obama’s mind is close enough. This time is different. If anything, there’s too much bipartisan support for Iran sanctions; the whole reason Harry Reid hasn’t let a vote come to the floor in the Senate is because he’s afraid pro-Israel Democrats will cross the aisle and join the GOP on a new slate of measures designed to turn the pressure up on Tehran. That could blow up O’s nuke negotiations with the mullahs. And even if new sanctions don’t pass, it may be impossible to get Congress to lift sanctions that are currently in effect as a reward for Iran if/when they meet some of the White House’s nuclear demands. That too is a function not of deadlock but of bipartisan agreement between Republicans and a slew of Democrats in Congress who are more hawkish towards Iran than Obama is. Solution: More unilateral action, of course. “The American people must get a say in any final nuclear agreement with Iran to ensure the mullahs never get the bomb,” [Sen. Mark] Kirk told the Washington Free Beacon. “The administration cannot just ignore U.S. law and lift sanctions unilaterally.”… Top White House aides have been “talking about ways to do that [lift sanctions] without Congress and we have no idea yet what that means,” said one senior congressional aide who works on sanctions. “They’re looking for a way to lift them by fiat, overrule U.S. law, drive over the sanctions, and declare that they are lifted.”… “It’s no secret that the president, with executive power, can determine sanctions implementation, particularly with waivers and the decision not to sanction certain entities,” said Jonathan Schanzer, a former terrorism finance analyst at the Treasury Department, which is responsible for enforcing sanctions… “In the case of Iran, such an approach could allow Washington to reach a nuclear accord without Congress having to vote on rescinding, even temporarily or conditionally, certain sanctions,” Clawson wrote. “No matter how stiff and far-reaching sanctions may be as embodied in U.S. law, they would have less bite if the administration stopped enforcing them.” It’s not that O’s going to somehow unilaterally repeal the sanctions in effect. A la the employer mandate, he’ll simply refuse to enforce existing law, using executive orders and waivers to make sure that funds that Congress wants choked off will somehow find their way to Iran if the mullahs play ball. The counterargument here, I guess, is that presidents always have some latitude in how they enforce sanctions. Right, but this isn’t a quibble about how best to carry out a mutually agree-upon policy; it’s a case of the executive and legislature being seemingly at loggerheads on the core question of whether U.S. policy should involve more pressure on an enemy or less — at a sensitive moment of international diplomacy to boot. Against that backdrop, systematically relaxing sanctions would amount to O substituting the policy he favors for the one favored by Congress. That’s actually bolder than his decision not to enforce the mandate, which Democrats were happy to see him do (even though they had passed the mandate in the first place) since it averted an extra ObamaCare-related political headache for them this year. By relaxing Iran sanctions, he’d potentially be defying his own party too. Exit question: Pro-sanction Democrats in Congress will ultimately end up playing along with this, though, right? The bona fide Iran hawks will be angry, but the fencesitters who like to project hawkishness to show support for Israel without being heavily invested in the subject might find this a dandy solution to their dilemma. If the fate of sanctions is left to them, their choice is either to sabotage Obama’s deal with Iran by refusing to relax sanctions or to be accused of selling out Israel by agreeing to relax them. Better to let the lame duck in the White House take the heat by doing what he wants and then either taking vicarious credit if his policy works or beating him up if it doesn’t. No surprise, by that logic, that some pro-sanctions Dems have been spotted toning down the rhetoric lately. They’ll defer to O in the end. What do they have to lose? ",

        "articles": "Trump’s had enough solid numbers this week to expect he’ll win tomorrow night going away, but if you’re desperate for hope and looking around for data to cling to, there’s plenty out there. CNN’s survey earlier this week showed Trump dropping like a rock after his “Bush lied!” performance at the debate, from 40 percent to 31. Two days ago we got a national poll from WSJ/NBC showing Ted Cruz, whose support has been flat in South Carolina this week, nosing past Trump to take a two-point lead. Now here comes the WSJ/NBC again — this time using a different pollster than the one that conducted their national poll — and finding Cruz creeping up in SC as Trump’s begun to slip. Hmmmm. Don’t stop believin’. At least for the next 32 hours or so. Donald Trump is now leading Saturday’s South Carolina Republican primary by 5 points — down from his 16-point lead in the state a month ago, according to results from a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll. Trump gets support from 28 percent of likely Republican primary voters in the state, while Ted Cruz gets 23 percent. They’re followed by Marco Rubio at 15 percent, Jeb Bush at 13 percent, and John Kasich and Ben Carson at 9 percent each. In the January NBC/WSJ/Marist poll — conducted before this month’s Iowa and New Hampshire contests — Trump held a 16-point over Cruz, 36 percent to 20 percent, with Rubio at 14 percent and Bush at 9 percent. Hey, it’s just one poll, right? Actually, no: Just as I’m writing this, a new poll dropped from Clemson University putting Trump at … 28 percent. In fact, take a peek at the RCP average of all South Carolina polls over the last 10 days. On February 14th, the day after his “Bush lied!” comment at the debate, Trump was at 37.0 percent. Five days later he’s at 32.9, partly due to today’s WSJ/NBC but partly also due to a Harper survey that put him at 29. And that average doesn’t include Clemson’s numbers. Also, there have been whispers all week among politicos on social media that some private polls conducted for third-party groups in SC have Trump south of 30. Harry Enten of Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight site dropped this cryptic tweet last night: I expect Trump to win in SC, but I've seen some stuff (i.e. numbers) over the past 24 hours that makes me a little uneasy… — (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) February 18, 2016 Trump has enough of a lead that he’ll probably win even if the debate really did hurt him, but he’s playing with so many different political matches lately that no one really knows if one of them might catch fire. Will his spat with the Pope alienate some last-minute undecideds? Probably not, but maybe! How about him talking up the ObamaCare mandate on CNN last night? Doubtful, but could be! On top of all this, don’t forget that Newt Gingrich trailed badly in the final polls before the election in SC four years ago and ended up blowing out the field. That win was attributed to his famous debate answer attacking the media shortly before SC went to vote, which just reinforces my point here — you don’t really know how a notably good, or bad, soundbite will play in South Carolina right before people go into the booth. The other X factor right now is Rubio. Go back to the RCP poll average that I linked above and you’ll find that Cruz hasn’t risen as Trump has slipped. The guy who’s rising is Rubio, who was averaging 14.0 percent the day after the debate last weekend and is now right behind Cruz for second with 17.1 percent of the vote, no doubt thanks in part to Nikki Haley’s endorsement. Remember that buzzy ARG poll last night that showed Rubio surging into second with 20 percent? There are new numbers this morning. He’s still surging: He’s not going to catch Trump at that rate but he could poison Cruz before the SEC primary if these numbers are anywhere near accurate. One caution about Rubio, though: Jay Cost is right that his surge in the overall RCP poll average is mainly just a function of his numbers in the ARG poll. Of the last seven surveys taken (including Clemson), five have him at 15-16 percent, not 20-22. In all five of those polls, he trails Cruz. That’s the other half of the suspense tomorrow night along with Trump’s performance — is the Rubio surge for real, enough for a shocking second-place finish, or is he looking at a possibly very narrow third-place win over Jeb Bush, a great disappointment after all the hype about Haley this week? The complexion of the race will change wildly depending upon which of those pans out. Exit question via Jonathan Last: Why aren’t Cruz and Rubio blowing up Trump over his “Bush lied!” comments? Is defending Bush that risky even in a Republican primary? And, bonus question: Will this day pass without either of them dropping a new ad about Trump’s support for the mandate? Lots of South Carolinians are making up their minds today. Better get cracking. ",

Two Democratic Party leaders in Michigan face nine felony counts after prosecutors allege that they forged documents to put fake Tea Party candidates on the ballot. Unlike other schemes where Democrats allegedly recruited candidates to run on ersatz Tea Party organization identities, these “candidates” had no idea they were on the ballot at all, some of them only discovering it after receiving delinquency notices on filings. Fox News in Detroit reports that the grand jury is still probing the matter and that there may be more indictments coming: Two Charged in Tea Party Election Fraud: MyFoxDETROIT.com Two former leaders of the Oakland County Democratic Party are facing a total of nine felonies for allegedly forging election paperwork to get fake Tea Party candidates on November’s ballot. … Former Oakland County Democratic Chair Mike McGuinness and former Democratic Operations Director Jason Bauer face up to 14 years in prison if convicted. “Some of the people didn’t even know they were on the ballot till they began receiving delinquency notices of filings that were required as a candidate,” said Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard. The sheriff says 23 statewide races had questionable Tea Party candidates on the ballot and the investigation may go beyond Oakland County. The charges involve forgery, fraud, and perjury. The prosecution alleges that the two signed candidacy materials under false pretenses, forms which require people to acknowledge that they are under oath to provide truthful and accurate information. If they signed the forms themselves under the names of people who didn’t know what the two Democrats were doing, those charges should be easy to prove in court. The two will face years in prison. The question will be whether this was part of a larger operation to dilute the ballot to help Democrats, a scheme that failed anyway. If McGuiness and Bauer end up facing the long end of a 14-year sentence, they may be highly motivated to tell prosecutors about any wider plans in Michigan to defraud voters. Fox notes that the grand jury continues to probe this even after the indictments against the two Oakland County Democratic Party leaders, which might mean more indictments will be forthcoming. We will definitely keep an eye out for further developments. ",

        "articles": "Just a brief update in our years long coverage of the Chevron Shakedown, and one which should be the last act in this sordid play, at least here in the United States. You may recall that about one month ago, the plaintiffs in the case, led by Manhattan Attorney Steven Donziger and his group of “environmentalist” allies, filed an appeal from the last in a long series of judgements which had gone against them. Having unsuccessfully tried to pick Chevron’s pockets to the tune of billions of dollars in a corrupt trial in Ecuador, Donziger had been found to have engaged in racketeering and massive corruption. He had hoped to take a last ditch chance and ask the Supreme Court to hear his appeal. This week that last chance fell through as the Supremes passed on the invitation, allowing the lower court’s judgement to stand. (Bloomberg) The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a ruling that protects Chevron Corp. from having to pay $8.6 billion in a decades-long battle over oil pollution in Ecuador, rebuffing an American lawyer who was found to have committed fraud in the Central American country’s court. The attorney, Steven Donziger, said a federal appeals court had exceeded its authority by letting Chevron use a U.S. racketeering law to block enforcement of the Ecuadorian award. The appeals court said Donziger and his team of lawyers engaged in “a parade of corrupt actions,” culminating with a promise to pay a judge $500,000 to release a ghostwritten opinion as his own. The rejection leaves Donziger and Ecuadorian plaintiffs in the case with fewer options for collecting the award, which the company has refused to pay. Chevron doesn’t have any assets in Ecuador. Chevron put out only a brief statement, summing up how they viewed the termination of this years long battle. (BusinessWire) “The facts of the Ecuadorian judicial extortion scheme and the illegality of the plaintiffs’ lawyer misconduct have been finally and conclusively affirmed by the legal system of the United States,” said R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice president and general counsel. “Today’s decision is an important step toward bringing this illegal scheme to a final conclusion.” Even now I find it hard to believe how long this has been going on. Other groups had, in years past, brought similar claims against other energy industry corporations and all too often those tactics worked. Not because the companies were neccessarily at fault, but because it was simply cheaper (or at least faster) to settle out of court and send the allegedly aggrieved parties on their way. This may be the first time that a company took such a stand, at least against such a massive and obviously fraudulent settlement and fought it through each and every step of the legal process. Donziger gets nothing, at least in the United States, and he’s now on record as being the author of a racketeering scheme. Sadly, this may not be the last we hear of it, however. The plaintiffs are still looking for a way to pry open Chevron’s bank account and will continue their attempts to do so in Canada and potentially other countries as well. Stay tuned. I have the feeling that having received this level of vindication, Chevron won’t be giving an inch there, either. ",

        "articles": "Texas Republican lawmakers are moving forward with a conservative agenda and Governor Abbott took a moment Saturday to celebrate that. Abbott tweeted out a list of conservative legislative victories achieved in the Texas House of Representatives over the span of 48 hours. It’s enough to make any Republican governor up for re-election proud. A list of six bills includes issues like election integrity, ending homeless camps across the state, improving standardized testing requirements, a heartbeat law to protect unborn babies, penalizing cities that defund police, and penalizing protesters who block roadways. All of these are hot-button issues in the state and most have been on the top of Abbott’s list of priorities. In 48 hours the Texas House voted to: * Defund cities that defund police * Ban abortion at detection of heartbeat * Slash STAAR test requirements * Ban homeless camping statewide * Penalize protestors blocking roads * Ensure election integrity- easy to vote, hard to cheat In 48 hours the Texas House voted to:* Defund cities that defund police* Ban abortion at detection of heartbeat * Slash STAAR test requirements* Ban homeless camping statewide* Penalize protestors blocking roads* Ensure election integrity- easy to vote, hard to cheat  — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) May 8, 2021 I know the Texas legislature is on the right track because the usual liberal columnists are grousing about it and the fact that it all but assures Abbott’s re-election chances if he decides to pursue another term as governor. There is some buzz that he may decide to run for president, though if I had to bet, it’d be that he chooses to run for governor again. Maybe in 2028, he’ll run for president. There is plenty of time between now and the Republican primaries for 2024 so anything can happen. One columnist described it as “the Greg Abbott Protection Session.” He had to admit, though, that the election integrity legislation doesn’t crack down as hard as it was originally intended to do, especially in Harris County (Houston) where elected officials blatantly disregarded election law in order to use the pandemic as a reason to skirt procedures. Nothing will stop the Democrat trope that Republicans are denying access to voting for black and brown voters. Even on Abbott’s performance during the pandemic, only a small percentage of Republican voters are disgruntled. They’ll get new statewide election laws to tighten down on voting, although not the vengeful crackdown on Houston that was proposed. That only leaves the Republicans who were mad at Abbott over COVID-19 restrictions, and they don’t seem mad anymore. Only 13% of Republicans disapproved of Abbott’s performance in the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll, and that included a higher percentage of abortion opponents no doubt satisfied with the new House and Senate bills. The UT/Texas Tribune poll leans routinely leans liberal. Shocker, I know. Even with some high-profile Republicans reported to be considering running for governor, Abbott likely has no worries. If either Attorney General Ken Paxton of McKinney, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller of Stephenville or Republican state Chairman Allen West of Garland is planning to challenge Abbott, he hasn’t left much running room. “I don’t think Abbott has anything to worry about from Allen West,” Rice University political scientist Mark P. Jones wrote by email. “The GOP leadership is pushing enough conservative red meat … that even when some portions of it lay on the butcher’s floor rather than as law, there will be enough legislation for Abbott to hang his hat on such that no one who is serious will be able to question his conservative credentials. “ Besides the legislation supporting the police and dealing with election integrity, the one bill that caught my attention is the one that addresses protesters blocking public roads. Especially with protests in the streets so regularly, it is important that innocent bystanders or drivers not get caught up in potentially violent situations. It’s a public safety issue as emergency vehicles become trapped with motorists at intersections. A video that went viral yesterday with a trending hashtag of #Plano shows a BLM protest in Plano, Texas (a suburban city outside of Dallas) where a large intersection was blocked. One man got out of his vehicle and confronted the protesters. Warning: strong language Last week an angry driver confronted the group of #BLM protesters who shut down the road with impunity in Plano, Texas. pic.twitter.com/kf7PKWvJbk — Andy Ngô (@MrAndyNgo) May 8, 2021 You can see that the man tried to get a policeman monitoring the situation to clear the intersection as the protesters try to move towards the man. The man did retreat without incident and law enforcement moves the protesters back. I can only imagine the frustration of the motorists caught up in it. This is an intersection used by motorists exiting a freeway. This has to stop. Protests cannot overtake public roads and infringe on the rights of others to move freely, especially when it becomes a life or death situation with emergency vehicles. Governor Abbott has called for an expansion in civics education in schools. This is an issue I’ve supported for years, frankly, and I’m hopeful that civics classes can be brought back. With the politicization of teachers’ unions and a strong lurch to the left in lesson plans, it’s important to bring back an old-school civics education. Students are being short-changed and not given complete educations – civics education should be a basic requirement as it once was in schools. There is movement in both the Texas House and Senate to ban the teaching of critical race theory. There is some mention that current events or public policy matters should be banned, too. That goes too far. It’s likely an attempt to squash liberal propaganda in the classroom. It is valuable to discuss current events, especially in government classes or history classes. There is no desire to jump on the critical race theory bandwagon, though. That has been discredited and should be tossed on the garbage heap of failed social experiments at the expense of the education of school children. “Texans reject critical race theory and other so-called ‘woke’ philosophies that maintain that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex or that any individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive,” Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said last week in a statement endorsing the legislation. “These divisive concepts have been inserted into curriculums around the state, but they have no place in Texas schools.” But educators and social justice experts see the efforts as an attack on the state’s civic education curriculum at a time when students should be learning more, not less, about civics, social justice and history. “There is more attention being given than ever before to the societal problem [of civic education] and how to fix it, which is why Texas, like every other state in the union right now, has so many civic education bills being put forth,” said Wendy May-Dreyer, who leads the Texas Civic Education Coalition. “The problem is we have a small faction who’s trying to quash that effort, that progress forward, and if we miss our opportunity, the Legislature doesn’t meet for another two years, and we likely have just missed the boat completely.” The Texas legislative session ends in three weeks.

        "articles": "While it’s certainly a serious topic which merits the debate going on around the country, there has been one exceptionally funny aspect to the entire RFRA discussion this week. It took some prodding from conservative outlets, but the media has at long last begun to grudgingly admit that virtually identical laws are on the books in nearly two dozen other states and on the federal level, many bearing the signatures of Democrats. This has left liberal opponents sputtering and side stepping in their attempts to say, well yeah, but this is way worse because… Republicans! Given a bit of time, though, the more erudite among them will come up with some better ways to parse it. One such effort is brought to us by Erick Eckholm at the Gray Lady. See if you can pick out the double standard at play. It begins with the opening salvo in the first sentence. When the federal government adopted a religious protection act in 1993, same-sex marriage was not on the horizon. While there is more to dig into, you could almost stop right there. So, Mr. Eckholm, you’re saying that the law which protected the religious liberty of some individuals was a good thing in 1992, but once we began debating the almost entirely unrelated matter of gay marriage, it’s no longer a good idea? I see. Let’s continue. I’ll need to add a bit of emphasis into this part. An informal coalition of liberals and conservatives endorsed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act because it seemed to protect members of vulnerable religious minorities from punishment for the exercise of their beliefs. The federal legislation was set off by a case involving Native Americans who were fired and denied unemployment benefits because they took part in ceremonies with peyote, an illegal drug. Twenty states, including Indiana last week, have since passed their own versions of religious freedom laws. But over time, court decisions and conservative legal initiatives started to change the meaning of those laws, according to liberal activists. The state laws were not used to protect minorities, these critics say, but to allow some religious groups to undermine the rights of women, gays and lesbians or other groups. This is what’s at the heart of it. Such laws are only of benefit to society if they are used to protect an oppressed minority. Never mind that we’re talking about the constitutionally mandated freedom of religion for all people. The legislation can suddenly become poisonous if it fails to be reserved for a small subset of people. Or, perhaps I could rephrase it for you. Hey! When we passed this thing you never said it was going to be used to protect Christians!! I’ve been watching this unfold since yesterday morning on several cable channels and in numerous newspaper articles. And honestly, none of them get any better than the item above in terms of making any sort of sense. In a rather sad fashion, they are almost making my point for me. Religious liberty is great unless and until it becomes inconvenient for a politically popular demographic and/or benefits the majority in any way. For a bit more on the coverage of this story, allow me to point you to this article at Rare by John-Henry Westen. It avoids the inherent hypocrisy of the preceding argument and gets to the root of why religious liberty is actually important to everyone… majority, minority or unaffiliated. According to critics, Pence’s signature is the equivalent of state-supported discrimination against gays. However, it is same-sex activists who have engaged in state-sponsored discrimination. In Colorado, Vermont, California, and many other states, Christian business owners who serve gay customers but do not wish to participate in same-sex ceremonies are being forced out of their livelihoods. Bakers, photographers, printers, wedding planners, and bed and breakfast owners have been subjected to government-sponsored prejudice because of their religious beliefs. It is therefore hypocritical for gay activists to target Indiana with such heated rhetoric. But perhaps more importantly, their accusations are based on a misunderstanding of both religious liberty and the RFRA itself. That’s a refreshing way to look at the RFRA, isn’t it? Perhaps we can get some of the cable news spokesmodels to give it a read. ",

        "articles": "Having singlehandedly made the “Romney 2016!” dream possible, I feel obliged now to start kicking the sand castle over. I’m inspired by this thought from Ramesh Ponnuru: Romney has sometimes lost but never been humiliated. A campaign now seems to me to run a non-trivial risk of that outcome. — Ramesh Ponnuru (@RameshPonnuru) January 14, 2015 Ross Douthat made the same point a few months ago: As Philip Klein has pointed out, Romney has almost nothing in common with Richard Nixon, the last defeated general-election candidate to successfully re-enter the lists. Nixon was a brilliant political infighter who had served as vice president for eight years after a successful congressional career and who lost one of the closest presidential elections in history; Romney is a one-term governor who underperformed in all three of his presidential campaigns (losing a winnable primary campaign in ’08, struggling to put away Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich in the ’12 primaries, and then disappointing relative to his own pollsters’ expectations in the general election) for reasons that were obvious to anyone who followed his performance on the trail. He has one great debate performance, an impressive private-sector career and a lot of human decency on his resume, but he offers nothing that’s responsive to the reasons the G.O.P. has lost the popular vote in five of the last six elections … no innovative policy portfolio on domestic issues (unlike Rubio and Ryan and Rand Paul), no record of broadening the party’s coalition to include more working class or black or Hispanic or young or female voters (unlike Christie, in his re-elect campaign), and no personal or biographical qualities (unlike Rubio, among others) that might help a little with G.O.P. rebranding among minorities or working-class voters… I think Republican voters understand this, even if some Republican consultants do not, which means that as long as there is somebody else who fits the party-unifying profile — most likely Rubio, possibly Christie, maybe a gubernatorial dark horse — a Romney campaign would lead the polls based on name recognition and then collapse upon contact with political reality. There is, as Ponnuru says, a non-trivial risk of that happening. Maybe, by sheer force of name recognition and boatloads of cash, Romney can hang around with 20-25 percent of the vote through the early states. Jeb Bush would pull another 20 percent, Christie would pull 10, and then the other half or so of the party would divide among various right-wing candidates. Romney could live with that outcome; it would give him a shot of winning both Iowa and New Hampshire as some critical mass of undecided Republicans chooses to vote strategically on “electability” grounds. If can win one of those states, he’d be viable to win Florida too: He won it in 2012, after all, and will stand a fair chance at a repeat given his ability to buy ad time in the state’s expensive media markets. Maybe he wins Florida too, consolidates the centrist vote after a faltering Bush and Christie drop out, and then take his chances the rest of the way against one or two conservative favorites. In other words, maybe he re-runs the race he ran three years ago and it works for him again. Maybe. That’s the very best best-case scenario. But what about the worst-case scenario? The idea of Romney faring roughly as well against Bush, Christie, Walker, Paul, Cruz, Huckabee, Jindal, Perry, and maybe Rubio as he did against also-rans like Gingrich, Santorum, and Herman Cain is ridiculous. Look no further than New Hampshire: Romney won the state going away in 2012, due mainly to the fact that his closest competition there was … Ron Paul and Jon Huntsman. What’s more likely to happen here, a la Douthat, is that he’ll get a bounce when he jumps in the race in the next month or two, probably leaping up temporarily to around 35 percent, and then his support will gradually erode as other candidates enter and introduce themselves to the public. Bush and Christie will both benefit from “not Mitt again” sentiment; so will center-right fusion candidates like Walker. It’s more likely, I think, that Romney heads to Iowa polling somewhere in the teens and that, as everyone expects, he ends up losing there to Huckabee, Paul, or even Bush. He’ll probably stick around for the New Hampshire primary a few weeks later — it won’t be easy to quit before the state that catapulted him to the nomination last time goes to vote — but I can see him entering that race in, say, fifth place behind Jeb, Rand, Walker, and maybe Christie or Rubio. Which brings me to my question in the headline: If that’s how he’s polling a week before the NH primary, what does he do? Huntsman staked everything on winning New Hampshire in 2012; he dropped out a week later after finishing third. Would Romney be willing to submit to the same fate or will he drop out beforehand if the polls look bad, purely as a matter of pride? Losing badly in a state that he won three years ago, right next door to the state he governed for four years, would be such a searing humiliation that I suspect he wouldn’t submit to it. If it looks like he’s destined to lose, I think he’d make the one move left to him to preserve his dignity and quit before letting New Hampshire fire him. That way he could play kingmaker before the big vote, throwing his support to Jeb or Christie or Rubio or whoever. If that man ended up winning the state, propelling him to the nomination, then at least Romney could claim some sort of legacy from that. As it is, by running again I think he’s stumbling towards building a different legacy, that of the data-crunching managerial genius who somehow couldn’t see harbingers of doom that were right in front of his face. Like Douthat says, his own polling team screwed up so badly that Team Mitt genuinely was caught by surprise on election night to find out they’d lost, and lost badly. Project ORCA, the campaign’s GOTV apparatus, became an Internet punchline after the fact. If Romney runs now and finishes as an afterthought, it’ll be one more sign that the whiz kid couldn’t read the tea leaves placed before him despite 20 years of practice in electoral politics that included two previous presidential runs. I hope, for the sake of his own peace of mind, he contends next year. At least for awhile. ",

        "articles": "Ted Cruz seizes the obvious talking-point opportunity: Why is President Obama threatening to shut down govt to shove Obamacare down Americans' throats? #DefundObamacare  — Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) September 19, 2013 All Republicans need to do now is get the “defund” CR through the Senate somehow and onto O’s desk for the veto. “The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.J. Res. 59, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014 and for other purposes, because it advances a narrow ideological agenda that threatens our economy and the interests of the middle class,” the Office of Management and Budget said in the statement. “The Resolution would defund the Affordable Care Act, denying millions of hard-working middle class families the security of affordable health coverage. “If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 59, he would veto the bill.” That last sentence was underlined and was the stronger version of a veto threat rather than the typical one that his advisers “would recommend” a veto. Mike Lee wants conservatives to rally around the idea of forcing Reid to hold an up-or-down vote on the House “defund” bill, which means he thinks he can at least get close to 51 with the help of red-state Democrats. Can he? Pryor and Manchin are conceivably “no” votes on O-Care; Landrieu and Begich would have to think hard too. Even with Obama as weak as he is now, though, I can’t believe Senate Dems wouldn’t hold together to defeat the measure. It’d mean the end of his presidency effectively if they didn’t. Lee’s goal here, I assume, is simply to make this as politically excruciating as he can for the White House in order to repay Boehner and the House GOP for giving the “defund” movement a shot. Won’t matter in the end — Reid won’t hold an up-or-down vote — but it’s good politics. Here’s Boehner’s office having some fun with President Bumblefark, who reserves his toughest negotiating stance for his real enemy. ",

        "articles": "If you say something like this on MSNBC, a gong sounds and a trapdoor opens beneath your feet. The clip picks up with Blitzer but what the other guy said immediately before this is worth noting too: “We’re also hearing now that the administration was warned about these potential problems months in advance,” Todd continued. “We spoke to a health care consultant who has clients who are insurers. He says his insurers, who dealt with the administration in the months ahead of time, had contentious meetings with people at [Health and Human Services] and other health care officials who were in charge of this, warning them, ‘This isn’t working, it’s not going to be smooth, don’t do it.’ He says those warnings were ignored, they went full speed ahead, and said we’ll work these problems out. There’s been a bit of pushback from the White House, we’ll hope to get more later from them.” Here’s Slate with a little more specificity about what the pre-launch warnings were likely about. I can’t remember right now where I read it, but one techie was quoted in a news story a few days ago as saying that using two different contractors to build the “front end” and “back end” of the site is sort of like trying to build a bridge by starting on opposite shorelines and trying/hoping to meet in the middle: So we had (at least) two sets of contracted developers, apparently in isolation from each other, working on two pieces of a system that had to run together perfectly. Anyone in software engineering will tell you that cross-group coordination is one of the hardest things to get right, and also one of the most crucial, because while programmers are great at testing their own code, testing that their code works with everybody else’s code is much more difficult. Look at it another way: Even if scale testing is done, that involves seeing what happens when a site is overrun. The poor, confusing error handling indicates that there was no ownership of the end-to-end experience—no one tasked with making sure everything worked together and at full capacity, not just in isolated tests. (I can’t even figure out who was supposed to own it.) No end-to-end ownership means that questions like “What is the user experience if the back-end gets overloaded or has such-and-such an error?” are never asked, because they cannot be answered by either group in isolation. The login issues with the site are now so profound that the feds apparently have no choice but to reset everyone’s password to make things run more smoothly, and by “everyone” I mean the few dozen or few hundred people who managed to successfully create an account in the first place. But never mind that. Blitzer’s offhand endorsement of a one-year delay is an intriguing bit of anecdotal evidence that Glitchapalooza might be nudging public opinion towards supporting a postponement of the law for a few months or a year while the bugs are worked out. But then that raises the question — why isn’t “delay” the GOP’s core message right now? Boehner’s holding one or two press conferences a day to complain that Obama won’t talk to him when he should be using that free media to hammer the point that O-Care isn’t ready for primetime. Frankly, unless I missed it, this has been a minor point from Ted Cruz and Mike Lee lately too. Whenever I’ve seen them on the news the past few days, they’re more likely to be talking about using small funding bills to restart parts of the government than the many, many catastrophic technical problems with the exchanges. What am I missing here? Why isn’t Glitchapalooza and “delay” the party’s top talking point right now, especially in the aftermath of that Sebelius bloodbath on “The Daily Show”? ",

        "articles": "Big if true, but how likely is it that it’s true? This is the same guy who tweeted yesterday that Russia “hacked our election,” an intentionally misleading Democratic talking point designed to suggest that Russia changed the vote totals on election night. They didn’t, of course, as Barack Obama himself acknowledged. This also isn’t the first time we’ve heard a top Democrat claim evidence of collusion between Trumpers and the Russians — but the last time it happened, Sen. Chris Coons had to backtrack and explain that he had misspoken. There was no conclusive proof, he later admitted. How soon before Schiff has to backtrack too? On top of all that, it’s awfully convenient timing that Schiff, a Democrat, would drop this bombshell damaging Trump so soon after Devin Nunes, his Republican counterpart on the House Intel Committee, dropped a bombshell of his own that supported some of Trump’s claims about surveillance and leaks (well, sort of). That reeks of Schiff wanting to step on the GOP’s “Nunes says Trump team was incidentally surveilled!” headlines with an even sexier headline of his own. Although there’s an alternate theory among left-wingers: this makes me wonder if nunes is blowing it up on purpose now that there apparently is proof of a there there  — Laura Rozen (@lrozen) March 22, 2017 If what Schiff says is true and Nunes knows it, then the Machiavellian move for Nunes would be to manufacture a more Republican-friendly storyline preemptively so that Schiff’s revelation has to battle for coverage. Hence today’s decision to reveal the news on incidental surveillance without first sharing it with his own committee and then running to the White House to brief Trump ASAP. After watching that and the contentious back and forth between Nunes and Schiff, John McCain is now calling for a select committee to wrest control of the Russia investigation from the House Intel Committee’s hands. Joe Scarborough, meanwhile, wants Nunes removed as House Intel chairman. I wonder if Nunes’s disclosures today won’t end up backfiring on him. Exit question: What possible “more than circumstantial” evidence of collusion might Schiff have seen? The only thing that pops to mind are those reports of Roger Stone having been in touch with Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0. That represents direct contact between a Trump associate and outlets that were involved in some of the hackings last year during the campaign, but direct evidence of collusion/coordination requires more than mere contact. Does Schiff know something about the nature of Stone’s communications with those outlets? Or is he not talking about Stone at all but rather referring to some different sort of evidence? Hmmmm.  ",

        "articles": "During the months-long debate in Congress over ObamaCare, opponents argued that the bill would become a back-door method to funding abortions through federal taxpayer dollars, which the Hyde Amendments prohibited in each budget. Democrats refused to attach the Stupak amendment to ObamaCare, which would have put the Hyde language into statute, and insisted that insurance companies would be required to segregate abortion coverage so that federal tax dollars did not fund abortion coverage. In the end, Bart Stupak and his small coterie of pro-life Democrats caved, and his party left those promises ringing in the air as they shoved the bill down the throats of voters, who were then and are now largely opposed to ObamaCare. More than four years later, the GAO confirms what opponents knew would happen when the federal government took over the health-insurance industry: The Government Accountability Office said in a report released late Monday that only 1 of 18 insurers it reviewed was separately itemizing a charge for coverage of elective abortions on enrollees’ bills. That detail is important because the original compromise that President Barack Obama sealed with anti-abortion Democrats stipulated that no federal funds would be used to pay for elective abortions. Instead, private health plans covering the procedure would collect a separate premium, which would be segregated from federal subsidies for other medical services. Although abortion is a legal medical procedure, longstanding federal laws prohibit taxpayer funds from being used to pay for it, except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. The new GAO review did not address the fundamental question of whether federal subsidies under the health law are being used for elective abortions, but abortion opponents said the findings underscore their view that the compromise is an accounting gimmick. In a written response, the Health and Human Services Department said it “acknowledges that additional clarification may be needed” when it comes to the health law’s provisions on abortions. If they aren’t segregating the coverage, then any subsidies provided go explicitly for abortion coverage. That’s pretty simple, as the subsidies are calculated in part on the price of the premiums. It’s worth noting, as it was at the time of the ObamaCare debate in Congress, that subsidies would still indirectly facilitate abortion coverage even if insurers were following the law, but since they’re not, that point is moot anyway. Another promise at the time from the Obama administration was that each state would have to provide at least one option without abortion coverage for those opposed to the practice. Consider that a second promise broken by Barack Obama’s HHS: The GAO report found that in Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont, all insurance plans offered on the exchanges cover abortions above and beyond the exceptions for rape, incest and the mother’s life. The health law required the Office of Personnel Management to ensure there was at least one insurance policy in each state that did not cover abortion except in the restricted circumstances. The report’s timing isn’t going to help Democratic incumbents defending their seats in the next few weeks, Politico notes: The report’s release is likely to elicit new election-year attacks on congressional Democrats from anti-abortion groups and Republicans who warned that Obamacare would allow for taxpayer subsidized abortions. In other words, Republicans were right about the Obama administration’s motives on this point, and Democrats in Congress made themselves complicit in the deception. Why shouldn’t that be part of the accountability of ObamaCare-supporting incumbents in this election cycle? ",

        "articles": "Via Charles Cooke and Legal Insurrection, which has the relevant Texas statutes. Quote: (e) A person who has a right to be present at the location where the force is used, who has not provoked the person against whom the force is used, and who is not engaged in criminal activity at the time the force is used is not required to retreat before using force as described by this section. No duty to retreat. LI argues, in fact, that not only did she have no duty, she had no real opportunity. I’m not sure I agree — we’d have to see the layout of the gas station, whether she could have made it inside to where the attendant was, whether she could have made it safely inside the car and driven away before he got the door open, etc — but the point is moot. In Texas, if a man swings at you with a knife, you’re entitled to protect yourself by pulling your gun. Three points. One: Whether or not a duty to retreat would have prevented the shooting, it might very well have cost her her car. If she had run off, all the attacker had to do was get in and drive away. That’s one of the points of SYG laws — why create an incentive for miscreants to intimidate innocent people into fleeing a scene by forcing them to run when violence is threatened? Two: Although I’m skeptical that any jury would be a stickler about the duty to retreat in a case of sexual assault, the respective genders of assailant and shooter here illustrate why SYG can in some situations be especially useful to women. If a man steps out from the bushes in front of a woman on an isolated path at night, brandishing a knife, and tells her to get undressed, in theory she’d be required in a “duty to retreat” jurisdiction to run if she has the opportunity, even if she has a gun in hand. Would any jury convict her if she decided to stand her ground and shoot the bastard right there? Almost certainly not, but that’s because even people in DTR jurisdictions recognize the injustice of making a victim take a needless risk in a dangerous situation. Three: Er, what’s going on here with the woman pausing after the shooting to take photos? The news station’s legal expert says she likely won’t be charged, which is true, but if I’m the prosecutor I’d want to know more about that. Very strange. ",

        "articles": "Last year, self-proclaimed Socialist Francois Hollande and his fellow Socialist lawmakers were elected to the presidency and parliament in a glorious wave of anti-austerity enthusiasm, as he promised to raise taxes on the wealthy, grow the economy, and eschew those nasty “right-wing” policies of former President Sarkozy. …Which is getting kind of awkward, because Hollande did assure Brussels he would have no problem sticking with the previous government’s promise to keep France’s nominal budget deficit to below three percent of GDP in the international effort to rescue the euro. As you might imagine, it’s a feat that the Socialists have been oddly unable to manage so far (which is just plain weird, because socialist policies logically and historically work every time in growing the economy, or whatever). In light of the eurozone’s recently and ‘unexpectedly’ disappointing economic growth reports, however, and Germany and France’s respective roles as the largest and second-largest economies in the eurozone, Berlin and Brussels really must insist that France do its part to keep their eyes on the prize of fiscal sustainability. The Financial Times reports: François Hollande will make his first visit as French president to Greece on Tuesday carrying the same anti-austerity message to Athens that won him election to the Élysée Palace last May. … But managing the balance between growth and austerity has become a bit more complicated for Mr Hollande back home in France – and with his European partners (notably Germany) – since his Socialist government admitted it was likely to miss its key goal for the public finances this year because of slumping growth in the eurozone. … The problem for Mr Hollande is that Brussels and Berlin may now insist that France wields an additional budgetary axe to ensure the deficit target is met after all – in other words they may insist on more austerity. … But Mr Hollande’s government, which spent most of its early deficit-cutting energies on big tax increases, is only now getting down to the painful business of allocating reductions in public spending to achieve the €60bn in cuts it has earmarked over the next five years. Public spending, by the way, accounts for a whopping 56 percent of GDP, the second-highest ratio in Europe — and yet the Socialists remain reluctant to even take a crack at cutting down any of these government outlays, quelle horreur, while the rest of the eurozone also continues to keel over beneath the weight of their collective inability to stop the spending. Do you suppose that that attitude had anything to do with them coming in with so much negative economic growth in the last quarter, peut-être? Eurozone rules require that member countries meet their deficit reduction targets in the collective fight to salvage the whole thing from ruin, but if even not-a-bit-player France cannot/will not do their part, I don’t think Germany will be at all pleased. These are going to be some tense negotiations. ",

        "articles": "Golly, I thought populists liked it when Cruz did that. Now it turns out that type of insolence is a liability in a president. Frankly, that attitude sounds … establishment-y. I guess it’s time for the “Donald Trump scolding other people for incivility” act of this circus. Donald Trump bashed Ted Cruz’s “temperament” and defended his presidential campaign’s ground game during an appearance Tuesday at the John Wayne Birthplace Museum. “Ted has got a rough temperament, you can’t call people liars on the Senate floor when they are your leaders. Not a good thing to do if you want to curry favor and get the positive votes later on own,” Trump said. “Ted is worried about his temperament, people are talking about his temperament. I haven’t talked about his temperament but he’s got to be careful because his temperament has been questioned a lot.” While Trump is busy hitting Cruz on intangibles, Cruz is hitting Trump on amnesty: “I like Donald Trump, I respect him personally, and in this campaign he’s talked a lot about illegal immigration and amnesty,” Cruz told the crowd. Going on to detail the 2013 immigration reform battle in Congress — legislation he opposed — Cruz continued, “We were on the verge of losing this fight, and 12 million people here illegally would be granted amnesty. And yet when that fight was being fought, Donald was nowhere to be found.” Prodding further on an issue that is central to Trump’s campaign, Cruz continued, “If you didn’t stand up and fight amnesty when the stakes were live or die, when the stakes were, ‘Do we lose this permanently or do we win?’ then I would suggest as voters you have reason to doubt the credibility of the promises of a political candidate who discovered the issue after he announces for president.” Some Trump fans on social media laughed at Cruz for the idea that a private citizen could have done anything meaningful to fight the Gang of Eight bill when it was simmering in the Senate. I don’t know: Any Sarah Palin fan would insist that she’s done lots of good agitating against Obama’s initiatives and mobilizing grassroots conservatives over the years since she left office. The prestige of conservative talk radio is based on the same idea, that an effective communicator with a giant media megaphone can move opinion. How many private citizens in the United States had the sort of omni-partisan media reach that Trump had back in 2013? There’s Oprah and … who else? Trump slammed the Gang of Eight bill in his CPAC speech that year, but that was a speech to a small niche of committed conservatives. What’d he do to try to rally the other 97 percent of his “Apprentice” viewership? Two points about the significance of Trump attacking Cruz’s temperament. One: It signals that he’s probably now resigned to conservative talkers turning on him. One of the few times he’s gotten smacked by Rush et al. this primary was when he called Cruz a “maniac” last month for antagonizing Senate Republicans. Said Mark Levin at the time: “This has to be the dumbest strategy yet, defending the establishment,” Levin continued abut Trump’s Fox News Sunday interview. “Trashing Cruz? Look, there are things you can question Cruz about, his past position on immigration, his past position on trade, substantive, positions you can question him about. This is not that! You and I rally around him and have because of the way he’s taken on the establishment, because of the establishment that Trump’s taking on. So why raise a stupid issue?” Trump backed off a few days later at the debate, insisting that Cruz has a “wonderful” temperament. Now he’s back to smacking Cruz for insulting McConnell, knowing that talk radio has no choice but to punish him for it. In fact, that’s exactly what Cruz fans have been waiting for — a peg to start the “Trump is part of the establishment” attacks. Here it is. No turning back. Two: We’re back to the question of who the establishment itself would prefer if forced to choose between Trump and Cruz as nominee. Cruz fans are completely invested in the idea that it’s Trump; Cruz’s brand rests on him being seen as an indefatigable scourge of the “Washington cartel” from the right. Trump’s position is more nuanced. He can’t cuddle up too closely to Beltway Republicans or else it’ll undercut his populist cred, but a little cuddling arguably helps by signaling that he won’t be the dangerous loose cannon as president that his critics fear. If Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan think they can learn to live with him, surely undecided voters can feel better about handing power to him. He’d almost certainly be easier for them to influence as president than Cruz would, as House Republicans are reportedly now recognizing. On the other hand, how likely is it that people who crave political stability would rather gamble on Donald Trump than Cruz? Rich Lowry says that Republican establishment types are telling him that they think Trump would run better than Ted Cruz in the general election. That would seem unlikely given the publicly available data. Trump is running behind Clinton in head-to-head polling, while Cruz is ahead of her. Neither does Trump seem to have much room to grow among general election voters. Trump’s favorability numbers are toxic among independents and Democrats (and not that great among Republicans.) If you were simply going for the most “electable” candidate, Cruz wouldn’t be your first choice, but he makes much more sense than Trump. So what are the establishment types doing? If I had to guess a reason (beyond spite and incompetence – though those would suffice) for why Republican establishment types are talking up Trump’s chances in the general election, it would be to prevent a panic stampede to Cruz among the chamber of commerce conservatives and upper-middle-class moderates that make up the constituency for candidates like Rubio, Christie, Bush, and Kasich. Cruz beats Trump in head-to-head polling. Trump beats Rubio in head-to-head polling. Trump only beats Cruz if there is a strong three-way race (with Rubio in third place.) That seems too cute by half. Trump and Cruz are neck and neck in Iowa; if Trump’s the one you fear, why on earth would you take the risk of puffing him up two weeks before Iowa votes? I don’t think there’s any looming stampede headed Cruz’s way anytime soon unless Rubio crumbles in New Hampshire, in which case you’ll probably see his voters split between Cruz and whoever the establishment candidate is. Until then, Trump has time to woo center-right voters by grumbling about Cruz’s bad manners towards Washington and hinting at how much better he’d work with Congress than Cruz would. Voters like compromise in theory, if not in practice. This is Trump’s small way of suggesting that Cruz is the real radical in the race, not him. ",

        "articles": "In the federal budget, just how big a hole would $22 billion be? As Michael Grunwald points out at Politico, that’s “larger than the annual budget for NASA, or that of the Interior Department and EPA combined[.]” And the shortfall is entirely due to the changes Barack Obama has made to student-loan programs — and could grow to ten times that amount over the next decade: In obscure data tables buried deep in its 2016 budget proposal, the Obama administration revealed this week that its student loan program had a $21.8 billion shortfall last year, apparently the largest ever recorded for any government credit program. The main cause of the shortfall was President Barack Obama’s recent efforts to provide relief for borrowers drowning in student debt, reforms that have already begun to reduce loan payments to the government. For more than two decades, budget analysts have recalculated the projected costs of about 120 credit programs every year, but they have never lowered their expectations of repayments this dramatically. … That’s a big quasi-bailout, increasing the deficit nearly 5 percent. The White House budget office was unaware of any larger re-estimates since the current scoring rules for credit programs went into effect in 1992. As a January Politico Magazine feature on the government’s unusual credit portfolio reported, the Federal Housing Administration has stuck more than $75 billion worth of similar re-estimates onto Uncle Sam’s tab over the last two decades, most of them after the recent housing bust led to a cascade of FHA-backed mortgage defaults. But it’s never had a one-year shortfall quite as drastic as this. It’s not yet clear whether this will be a hefty one-time revision, or a harbinger of oceans of red ink as millions more borrowers get relief on their payments to the government. Several reports by Barclays Capital have warned that Obama’s generosity to borrowers could leave the student loan program as much as $250 billion in the hole over the next decade. And behind closed doors, officials in the White House budget office and the Treasury Department have criticized the Education Department’s loan models as overly optimistic, with some officials pushing internally for third-party audits. Wait, what? You can’t get something for nothing? Color me shocked, shocked to find out that having the government take over student loans and then increase their lending by 44% in the past two years produced a flood of red ink. Recall that Obama insisted on a government takeover of the student-loan industry because banks weren’t lending generously enough for Obama’s tastes and were profiting too much off of government guarantees. In FY2008, the budget for the Direct Loan program was $500 million. Now that the DLP is the only game in town, the annual shortfall in DLP is 430 times the annual budget in FY2008. Think about that for a moment. This is why lending programs work best when the stakeholders can’t just print their own money. This comes up at a very bad time for the next Obama giveaway, “free” community college education. The White House tried to claim that the program would “only” cost $60 billion over the next decade, while serving 9 million students. However, the average tuition for 9 million students would put the actual cost at $34 billion each year, and that’s assuming that the flood of government subsidies doesn’t push demand and price up significantly, just as the student-loan takeover did. Oh, and that $22 billion will go directly against the deficit, and Congress can’t do anything about it, as it’s structured as an entitlement. What they can do is take money out of Obama’s other programs to cover the gap, and that’s exactly what they should do — while explaining very loudly why it’s necessary, and why we need to end this “quasi-bailout” of the university system forthwith.

        "articles": "Remember when you’re watching this that it pertains to the same people who now argue that they know better than you about what kind of insurance coverage you need. CBS News reports that an internal memo warned the White House three years ago that the Healthcare.gov project was turning into a disaster, and that no one with any expertise had control of the project: CBS News is learning the Obama administration knew of the risks associated with the Obamacare rollout well before last month. Three years ago, a trusted Obama health care adviser warned the White House it was losing control of Obamacare. A memo obtained by CBS News said strong leadership was missing and the law’s successful implementation was in jeopardy. The warnings were specific and dire — and ignored. David Cutler, who worked on the Obama 2008 campaign and was a valued outside health care consultant wrote this blunt memo to top White House economic adviser Larry Summers in May 2010: “I do not believe the relevant members of the administration understand the president’s vision or have the capability to carry it out.” Cutler wrote no one was in charge who had any experience in complex business start-ups. He also worried basic regulations, technology and policy coordination would fail. “You need to have people who have understanding of the political process, people who understand how to work within an administration and people who understand how to start and build a business, and unfortunately, they just didn’t get all of those people together,” Cutler said. The White House dismissed these and other warnings. It relied on appointed bureaucrats and senior White House health care advisers. Fearful of constant attacks from congressional Republicans, the White House became secretive about the law’s complexity and regulatory reach. The White House didn’t heed this warning for the same reason they embarked on this project in the first place. The bureaucrats and the activists thought they were smarter than the markets, and smarter than the people who have actual experience in the private sector. It’s the same infection that creates the monumentally tone-deaf argument that people should be happy that the government forced them out of existing plans they chose for themselves in order to pay more for coverage that the consumers know they don’t need. It’s unbridled hubris, and it produced this inevitable Greek tragedy that also doubles as farce. Now, keep this in mind, too. Did the White House bring in ground-up business people and web-savvy firms to take over from the bureaucrats and the contractors who wasted $400 million on a web portal that doesn’t portal anything? No — they brought in Jeffrey Zients, one of Obama’s economic advisers, and kept everyone else in place. With this background in mind, just how likely will it be that the November 30th deadline for full functionality will be met? ",

        "articles": "Television networks are usually on the hunt for advertising dollars. But, now we are in the midst of a presidential campaign election cycle and the last thing CNN wants to do is run a campaign ad that knocks its own reporters and on-air talent. CNN has refused to run two campaign ads submitted by the Trump re-election campaign but will air an ad that was submitted Thursday. The first one denied was “Biden Corruption” and it was released last week. The 30-second ad accuses Democrats of trying to steal the upcoming presidential election with the help of their “lapdogs” at CNN – Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo, Jim Acosta, and it also includes MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. CNN claims the ads aren’t factual and that the mention of its employees is enough to justify denying the airing of the ads. Another ad submitted to CNN and its corporate cousin Turner Sports on Thursday was rejected. CNN said the ad contains assertions about the whistleblower complaint against Trump that have been disputed by the intelligence inspector general, and uses the word “coup” to describe the impeachment process set forth in the constitution. A third ad was accepted. While the ad says “the swamp” hates Trump, flashing video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, it outlines actions taken in the president’s first term and asserts that it takes a “tough guy” to change Washington. Here is the “coup” ad: Just as CNN objects to the Trump campaign claim of corruption in Biden and his son’s dealings in Ukraine, the cable news network also objects to the impeachment hearings as the Democrats attempt of a coup, as the campaign claims. CNN said in a statement that “in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.” CNN cited similar concerns about false statements in declining the newer commercial, saying the spot makes claims about the whistleblower complaint against the president that the intelligence community inspector general has debunked. “In addition, it is inaccurate to use the word ‘coup’ to describe a constitutionally prescribed legal process,” the company stated, echoing critics who slammed Trump’s comparison of impeachment to an opposition group’s violent, illegal overthrow of a government. The third campaign ad is called “Changing Times” and has been approved for airing on CNN. The message is that “Mister Nice Guy” won’t cut it anymore. As you can see, it’s a fairly standard kind of campaign ad. A Trump campaign spokesman points to CNN using its platform to protect Joe Biden. His campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, said “CNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming, so it’s not surprising that they’re shielding him from truthful advertising too.” It is not unprecedented that a network deny airing a campaign ad. FOX did that, too, by the way, in 2017. FOX objected to a Trump ad that portrayed illegal immigrants as violent. The unusual part, as even the New York Times points out, is how early the denials are happening. It points to a very contentious campaign season. It is unusual but not unprecedented for television networks to reject a political advertisement from a presidential candidate. On the eve of last year’s midterm elections, major channels, including Fox News, removed a commercial from Mr. Trump’s political team that portrayed immigrants as a violent threat. But political ads tend to be contentious in the latter stages of a campaign — not 13 months before Election Day. And CNN’s decision could foreshadow a longer conflict between Mr. Trump’s political aides and network executives who are tasked with reviewing the accuracy of the information that reaches viewers. CNN’s bias is obvious to even the most casual viewer. FOX does have a bias toward Trump but the difference is that FOX also has on-air talent that isn’t pro-Trump. A good example is Shep Smith, who is a classic anti-Trumper. There is no on-air talent on CNN or MSNBC that anyone would label as pro-Trump. There is no attempt to bring a little balance. Even most of the conservatives brought on as guests are Never-Trump conservatives. Team Biden is trying to strong-arm FOX into not airing Trump’s campaign ad that focuses on Ukraine. In a letter to Fox News and Fox Business general counsel Lily Claffee, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz wrote that the ad “falsely states” that “Biden offered Ukraine $1 billion to fire the prosecutor investigating a company affiliated with his son.” “Though the Trump campaign is prepared to fabricate outright lies, your station’s airwaves should not be used to disseminate them,” Schultz wrote. “We are putting you on notice about the absolute falsity of the advertisement’s claims, and we expect that you will reject it. Please consider this letter a standing request that you reject any advertisement containing similar claims, regardless whether the Trump campaign or a third-party group seeks to place it.” We are putting you on notice. To which FOX responded, “We are not in the business of censoring ads from candidates on either side of the aisle.” “Vice President Joe Biden has a standing invitation to appear on any of our platforms.” Good old Joe doesn’t appear on FNC, though, and was recently caught pointing his finger in campaign reporter Peter Doocy’s face while demanding he “Ask the right question.” ",

        "articles": "Well, we now know Hillary Clinton is just a disaster when it comes to safeguarding classified information. FBI Director James Comey labeled her actions, and that of her staff, as “extremely careless” concerning handling classified information. Her email setup was not approved by the State Department. Her server was located in her basement, which wasn’t an authorized location. One hundred and ten emails on 52 separate emails chains had classified information on them, and were deemed as such when they were sent or received. In short, the entire Clinton narrative about her private emails system turned out to be–shocker–a total lie. Comey gutted that like a fish, but she won’t be charged. I mean, he did say that she was pretty much too stupid to understand the classification markers, even though the secretary of state is considered to be an original classification authority. So, Clinton skipped away from a criminal indictment. Perhaps many thought that would be outcome, but let’s go back to 2015, where The Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald wrote about how Clinton reacted to when Chelsea (then-known as Bradley) Manning decided to disclose sensitive materials he downloaded onto a Lady Gaga CD. He updated the post in light of the FBI’s findings last week [emphasis mine]: When it comes to low-level government employees with no power, the Obama administration has purposely prosecuted them as harshly as possible to the point of vindictiveness: It has notoriously prosecuted more individuals under the Espionage Act of 1917 for improperly handling classified information than all previous administrations combined. NSA whistleblower Tom Drake, for instance, faced years in prison, and ultimately had his career destroyed, based on the Obama DOJ’s claims that he “mishandled” classified information (it included information that was not formally classified at the time but was retroactively decreed to be such). Less than two weeks ago, “a Naval reservist was convicted and sentenced for mishandling classified military materials” despite no “evidence he intended to distribute them.” Last year, a Naval officer was convicted of mishandling classified information also in the absence of any intent to distribute it. […] In December 2011, Chelsea Manning’s court-martial was set to begin. None of the documents at issue in that prosecution was “top secret,” unlike the documents found on Hillary Clinton’s server. Nonetheless, the then-secretary of state convened a press conference to denounce Manning and defend the prosecution. This is what she said: If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Manning could face life in prison. The government has said it would not seek the death penalty. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called Manning’s alleged actions damaging and unfortunate in remarks to reporters at the State Department on Thursday. “I think that in an age where so much information is flying through cyberspace, we all have to be aware of the fact that some information which is sensitive, which does affect the security of individuals and relationships, deserves to be protected and we will continue to take necessary steps to do so,” Clinton said. Manning was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison. Greenwald added that the intelligence community overclassifies material, with former NSA and CIA Director Gen. Michael Hayden commenting that a simple email reading ‘Merry Christmas” came with a top secret classification. Hence, prosecutions regarding the mishandling of classified material could be the government often times delivering $1000 worth of punishment for $5 crimes. Yet, he added that Clinton never made those arguments, as to her opinion of the Manning case. “To the contrary, she more often than not defended it, using rationale that, as it turns out, condemned herself and her own behavior at least as much as those whose persecution she was defending,” he wrote. It just once again confirms how the Clintons live by a separate set of rules than everyone else, and how they’re not to be trusted. It also doesn’t help when you double down those narrative lies you peddled about those emails, as the FBI director has clearly stated otherwise: ",

        "articles": "Finally, finally, we know how to avert a second wave of the disease. And not a moment too soon. Tell Fauci to put on some gloves and hip waders, grab a bunch of plastic baggies, and head down into the nearest manhole. The answer lies below. Stories have been, uh, trickling out for weeks about the promising possibility of detecting new outbreaks early by analyzing a local community’s … output, shall we say. The idea isn’t novel, as scientists have used sewage for years for all sorts of epidemiological purposes. Stat noted in a story last month that one biotech start-up had taken to scrutinizing sewage to measure the extent of opioid use locally. Some European scientists have examined sewage to gauge the spread of antibiotic resistance via wastewaster. And, yes, other scientists have tracked viruses in the stuff. Once it became known that people infected with coronavirus shed it in excrement, it was a logical next step to try to detect new outbreaks by tracking the amount of aggregate virus in community wastewater. They did it in February in the Netherlands, the Times explained in a story a few weeks ago, with noteworthy results: “The researchers then went to remote towns without any known cases of Covid-19. They discovered the coronavirus up to six days before the first confirmed cases were found there.” French scientists tried the same thing in Paris for several weeks throughout March and early April. Another striking outcome: For the Paris study, Wurtzer and his colleagues sampled wastewater from up to five Paris-area plants twice a week between 5 March and 7 April. They noted “high concentrations” of viral RNA several days before 10 March, the first day that Paris recorded multiple deaths from COVID-19. Concentrations continued to rise a few days ahead of an acceleration in clinical cases and deaths in Paris. “We have a very clear curve that precedes the curve in numbers of clinical cases, and now with confinement, we see a flattening of that curve,” says Laurent Moulin, a study co-author and a microbiologist also at Eau de Paris. He estimates it took between a half a day and 3 days for the sewage to move from toilets to the treatment plants. It’s like peering into a crystal ball. Except in this case we’re peering into a toilet. The latest study comes from Yale and involves wastewater from New Haven and surrounding communities. Scientists wanted to know how well they could predict the rise and fall of confirmed cases in the community based on the rise and fall of the amount of virus in what they delicately describe as “sludge.” You ready? SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in sewage sludge were a leading indicator of community outbreak dynamics over hospitalization and compiled COVID-19 testing data. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations led hospital admissions by 3 days and COVID-19 cases by 7 days. Hospital admissions to Yale New Haven Hospital from the four towns served by the wastewater treatment facility both rose and fell more slowly than the observed RNA concentrations. The rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA increases and decreases were similar to the COVID-19 testing data, and reflect the very concentrated outbreak that took place within New Haven and its neighboring towns. The strong correlation between the virus RNA and COVID-19 case data provides an approach to independently evaluate the local SARS-CoV-2 testing rate and to estimate the number of new cases. While the results here demonstrate the potential utility of such an approach, we note that these relationships could be treatment plant specific, as primary sludge process trains are not uniform, and that compiled COVID-19 testing is prompted by symptoms, thus underestimating the true number of cases. If that’s too jargon-y, feast your eyes on the respective curves they’re describing. This graph is amazing. It shows that measuring #SARSCoV2 levels in municipal sewage almost perfectly predicts forthcoming #COVID19 cases with a full week's notice (R=0.994). It's one of several discoveries in this new study from @Yale:  C-19 is #InThePoop pic.twitter.com/shNzTKYoYP — Brennan Spiegel, MD, MSHS (@BrennanSpiegel) May 26, 2020 They’re nearly identical. The amount of virus in the “sludge” gave them almost perfect insight into how many new cases there would be a week later. The implications are obvious. By tracking the presence of virus in sewage day to day, local health authorities can potentially detect new outbreaks as they happen rather than wait for a bunch of sick — and contagious — people to show up at doctor’s offices days after they’ve already unwittingly begun infecting others. That would be especially useful in communities that are poor and might not have the same access to conventional PCR testing to warn them that the virus is spreading locally. Spotting an increase in the volume of virus in dookie would also provide notice to nearby hospitals to get ready and could give federal and state officials time to ship testing components and PPE to that community. And of course it would allow the local government to warn residents that the virus is surging and that they should immediately practice stringent social distancing to reduce the risk to themselves. With an early alarm like that, people might be able to choke off an outbreak before it gets going. Remember how exciting that Kinsa “health weather” map was because of its potential for detecting infections early? This is even better. Kinsa draws conclusions based on a single symptom (fever) among a select population (people who own Kinsa smart thermometers). It misses people who don’t use those thermometers and people who are asymptomatic. And since many COVID-19 patients are infectious before they show symptoms, even Kinsa’s technology may be picking up symptomatic cases too slowly to meaningfully retard a developing outbreak. Sampling wastewaster, by contrast, means sampling the entire population, including asymptomatics, and logically should be able to detect community spread as soon as viral shedding has begun. As an aggregate measure of the virus’s presence in a community, it’s better in every way. I don’t mean to overhype it. All I’m saying is that we just might sh*t our way to suppressing this contagion. Let that thought encourage you as we wait for a vaccine. In lieu of an exit question, here’s Scott Gottlieb yesterday making a point I hadn’t heard before, that although China is competitive with western countries in the race to be the first to develop a vaccine, there’s reason to believe western vaccines will provide more robust protection from COVID-19 because of their innovations. U.S VACCINE RACE: @WhiteHouse officials and public health experts appear optimistic the U.S. will be able to develop a #COVID vaccine quicker than China.

        "articles": "A liberal oriented protest at Oberlin College in Ohio won’t come as a surprise to anyone, particularly given the history of the institution. After all, it’s Lena Dunham’s alma mater, so how much more do you really need to know? But in an era where Yale and Mizzou are sucking up all the headlines for protests about racism and microagressions, you just knew that Oberlin would have to up the ante, and boy, did they. You see, at Oberlin, even the food in the dining hall is racist. (New York Post) Students at an ultra-liberal Ohio college are in an uproar over the fried chicken, sushi and Vietnamese sandwiches served in the school cafeterias, complaining the dishes are “insensitive” and “culturally inappropriate.”… General Tso’s chicken was made with steamed chicken instead of fried — which is not authentically Chinese, and simply “weird,” one student bellyached in the Oberlin Review. Others were up in arms over banh mi Vietnamese sandwiches served with coleslaw instead of pickled vegetables, and on ciabatta bread, rather than the traditional French baguette… Worse, the sushi rice was undercooked in a way that was, according to one student, “disrespectful” of her culture. I think these students are shining a bright light on a serious problem confronting our nation… the scourge of drug addiction. Because these kids have got to be stone. But seriously, I can see complaining over poorly prepared food. (You should’ve seen some of the horror shows we had when I was in middle school.) But to turn this into a complaint of racism rather than incompetence and poor planning might be a bit of a stretch. There was one item on the list of complaints which I suppose might have a basis for umbrage among the easily offended. Fried chicken! How dare they serve fried chicken? That’s just a slap in the face because it’s such a stereotype for racist jokes dating back to before World War 2. Wait… what’s that you say? They’re complaining about not getting fried chicken? Oberlin’s black student union joined in the fray this month by staging a protest outside Afrikan Heritage House, an on-campus dorm. The cafeteria there wasn’t serving enough vegan and vegetarian options and had failed to make fried chicken a permanent feature on the Sunday night menu, the school newspaper reported. Those students started a petition that also recommends the reduction of cream used in dishes, because “black American food doesn’t have much cream in it,” according to the Review. My snark meter has already pegged into the red zone, so I’m just going to let Insty close this one out. The whole article is a riot, and reads like outtakes from I Am Charlotte Simmons. But then, I’m from a simpler era — I don’t recall General Tso’s Chicken, sushi and vegan options in my school’s cafeteria, which largely doled out barely edible food that seemed like Civil War surplus. Has there ever been a generation of college crybullies simultaneously so spoiled, and so angry? As Glenn himself would say… indeed. ",

        "articles": "Remember when Barack Obama promised to bend cost curves downward with ObamaCare? Later, that pledge morphed into a claim that premiums wouldn’t go up as much as they did in the past; last month, it changed to a disclaimer that premiums wouldn’t go up any more sharply than without ObamaCare. Tell that to Floridians, who face double-digit premium increases when open enrollment starts this fall: Floridians who buy health insurance on the individual market for next year will face an average increase of 13.2 percent in their monthly premiums, according to rate proposals unveiled Monday by the state’s Office of Insurance Regulation. … Fourteen companies filed ACA-compliant plans for Florida’s 2015 individual market, including three new companies that did not participate on the federally-run exchange last year. Of the 11 returning plans, eight filed average rate increases ranging from 11 to 23 percent, and three filed rate decreases ranging from 5 to 12 percent, the state’s insurance regulator reported. Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who is campaigning for reelection, seized on the report to criticize his Democratic challenger, Charlie Crist, and the ACA, commonly referred to as Obamacare. “Obamacare is a bad law that just seems to be getting worse,’’ Scott said in a written statement. “Florida families are going to be slammed with higher costs.’’ HHS objected to the OIR’s report, claiming that it didn’t take into account the subsidies that taxpayers would use to pay insurers. That would reduce the bill for the average taxpayer to $50 a month, HHS said, but that’s a non-sequitur. The premiums are still skyrocketing in Year 2 for ObamaCare regardless of who pays the bill. And by the way, federal subsidies get paid by taxpayers in the end anyway; it’s just a sleight of hand to take the money from taxpayers on one hand and give them back in the other hand. Don’t forget that one of the supposed reasons that Congress had to overhaul and take control of the health-insurance industry wasn’t the uninsured, but cost control. We could have expanded Medicaid to cover those uninsured not by choice at much less cost and intrusiveness. Democrats insisted that escalating health-care costs also had to be addressed, including the cost of health insurance. So far, ObamaCare has made that worse rather than better, while still leaving tens of millions uninsured. By the way, do readers also recall how ObamaCare advocates gave credit for a slowdown in escalating health-care costs to the new law? Never mind: Some of the best news for health care in a while is also driving one of its biggest debates — what exactly is behind the historic slowdown in health-care spending these past few years. Just how much credit should be given to structural changes in the health-care system versus the effects of the Great Recession? The answer has major fiscal implications for the country’s future as the economy improves and millions more gain health insurance under the 2010 health-care law. Previous research has tried to answer this question, but a new study finds that the recession gets most of the credit for the recent slowdown in the growth of health-care spending, suggesting that an improving economy could accelerate health spending once again. After the annual growth rate for health care spending averaged 6.6 percent between 2000 and 2007, it shrank to just 3.3 percent each year between 2008 and 2011, according to the authors’ analysis of federal data. During those three years, the slumping economy accounted for 70 percent of the spending slowdown, according to a new peer-reviewed study from Northwestern University economists published in today’s Health Affairs journal. A separate working paper released Monday from the Brookings Institution also argues the slowdown is largely the result of the two previous recessions. If it’s any consolation to ObamaCare advocates, the law will almost certainly suppress economic activity, business expansion, and job creation over the long haul, so the recessionary effects aren’t likely to dissipate quickly. Update: I wrote Medicare when I meant Medicaid; I’ve corrected it above. ",

        "articles": "This week the Seattle City Council moved one step closer to imposing a sweeping sales tax on both weapons and ammunition which appears to fly in the face of a thirty year old state law banning such restrictions. A committee vote took place on Wednesday and the proposal will move to a full vote tomorrow. And this is just a bad deal all the way around. The committee voted unanimously this morning to send the proposal to the full city council for consideration next Monday, according to the Seattle P-I.com. Monday’s vote could set the stage for a legal confrontation, and there were hints that existing gun shops could move out of the city, and that gun owners living in Seattle will simply shop outside the city, thus thwarting any dreams that this tax will generate $300,000 to $500,000 annually for the city’s gun control efforts. Waiting in the legal tall grass are the Bellevue-based Second Amendment Foundation and Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. They’ve already advised against the tax proposal, primarily on the grounds that it will violate the state’s 30-year-old model preemption law. Even if this move were to pass muster in terms of the state’s preemption law, it is bound to accomplish very little beyond the thinly veiled intent of punishing lawful gun owners and gun shops. A tax such as this is certain to do almost nothing to total volume of sales except for those truly living on the edge and simply shifts business from one location to another. NRA ILA summarizes the concept. The burden of regressive taxes like the Seattle proposal falls squarely on those that are least able to afford them. Persons of means will simply drive outside the city to purchase firearms and ammunition, while those without such options will be forced to go forego their rights or pay the tax. This is especially egregious considering how those at the lower end of the economic scale also tend to reside in areas where violent crime is the highest. One wonders whether this type of social engineering on the downtrodden is an intended feature of the legislation rather than an unfortunate consequence. Supporters are claiming that this tax could bring in a half million dollars in revenue, but under the best of circumstances that sounds vastly inflated. It also doesn’t take into account how much it could affect the local market. As one local gun dealer pointed out, it’s a competitive sales space and they already sell pretty much on the margins. If he has to jack up the price of a ten or fifteen dollar box of ammunition by five dollars, shooters will simply go outside the city limits and buy their rounds where the tax is not applied. The same goes for new gun purchases. If sales plummet, the tax revenue goes down by default and if the shops close, the revenue disappears entirely. Of course, that’s been the idea all along. This isn’t a tax intended to raise revenue for vital services. It’s a political statement. That’s why the supporters of the proposal even call it the gun violence tax. They’re not expecting to raise cash or reduce violence. They’re simply looking to show their base constituents how “serious” they are about restricting gun rights. The irony behind all of this is that the city will doubtless face a series of expensive lawsuits if the tax is put in place and they’ll probably lose. In the end they will wind up getting no revenue and the taxpayers will be stuck with the bill for the court costs and associated expenses. But hey… this is Seattle. What did you really expect? ",

The bit about “circumventing longstanding processes” is a reference to the loooooooong State Department review — six years and counting — of whether Keystone, which would create more than 40,000 jobs during its construction, is in the “national interest.” That review is supposedly what’s being “cut short” by the bill on Obama’s desk. Although Sean Davis is right: In an era of unilateral presidential lawmaking, Congress attempting to set policy with bipartisan support (this one got 63 votes last month) itself qualifies as “circumventing longstanding processes.” McConnell says he’s going to try to override Obama’s veto with 67 Senate votes but no one thinks he can pull that many. The question now is whether Obama will use the veto as a bargaining chip, with approval of Keystone to follow if the GOP plays ball on another of his priorities, or if this is just a favor to his fabulously wealthy environmentalist donor base that nothing else will trump. I know how I’m betting. Via the Free Beacon, here’s the White Press Corps laughing at Josh Earnest today when he explains why six years isn’t necessarily a long time to review whether to build a pipeline.

        "articles": "Here’s how Spicer could have played this, if he hadn’t been directly ordered by his boss to back him up on what was said at last night’s meeting with congressional leaders. Which, let’s face it, is almost certainly what happened. Three simple points: 1. Some illegals do vote illegally. 2. We don’t comment on what was said by or to the president in private meetings. 3. The election is over and it’s time to get to work. Easy peasy. As to point one, there is indeed at least one study out there showing that illegals vote in high enough numbers to swing elections — very, very close elections, on the order of Al Franken’s razor-thin victory over Norm Coleman in Minnesota in 2008. Go back and read this post from 2014 for some thoughts on that study, which was genuinely alarming and important. The bombshell number from it was the claim that “More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote.” One of the researchers who compiled the data on which the study was based debunked the “14 percent” figure last year, though, claiming that it was a product of measurement error by the authors. The likely percentage of illegals who vote, the researcher claimed, is roughly zero. Jesse Richman, one of the authors of the study, wrote a short post of his own last October in response to Trump citing his study repeatedly on the campaign trail. Yes, said Richman, some illegals vote — but not in great numbers: Both sides of the debate on non-citizen voting have exaggerated our findings concerning non-citizen representation. There are many on the left side of that debate who have relentlessly sought to discredit our results and want to push the level of estimated non-citizen participation to zero. On the right there has been a tendency to misread our results as proof of massive voter fraud, which we don’t think they are. Our focus has been on the data rather than the politics. We found low but non-zero levels of non-citizen participation in elections. These levels are sufficient to change the outcomes in extremely close elections, as we illustrated in the paper. But one should keep in mind that such elections can be swayed by any number of factors that arguably bias election results toward, or against, particular parties and candidates. Put another way, our results suggest that almost all elections in the US are not determined by non-citizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions. When you’re talking about a spread of, say, 537 votes a la Bush/Gore in Florida 2000, yeah, that’s a moment to worry about illegals voting. When you’re talking about 3.5 million votes across the country? Nah. The question is why Trump and Spicer would continue to push this claim knowing that the evidence is thin and that they’re going to be dogged now by the media about ordering an investigation if they’re that concerned about it. (Watch Mara Liasson put that question to Spicer in the clip below.) This tweet is a few days old, having been posted after Spicer’s press conference on Saturday, but I think points two and three are pure perfection in diagnosing the Trump media strategy then and now: Re Spicer's lies, this is from someone who worked in a past administration. Important read. pic.twitter.com/XrjLJHRAGL — Anna Rascouët-Paz (@rascouet) January 22, 2017 Push the outlandish claim, knowing that it’s outlandish or even because it’s outlandish, and maximize the cognitive dissonance that forces supporters to commit even more deeply to the idea of Trump as the ultimate truth-teller. The goal is to reach the point where literally any damaging or inconvenient information, even if true, can be dismissed as “media bias” or “fake news” by the White House. I think this is going to go exactly as Stephen Miller predicts, the same as it went when Trump claimed during the campaign that he saw thousands of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey after 9/11. If the claim can’t be verified in its totality, the defense will shift to verifying any part of it and then claiming that that’s close enough to the whole truth to mean that Trump was basically right and his lying, discredited media detractors wrong. So, for instance, if the DOJ ends up reviewing ballots in California and finds that, say, 2,000 illegals voted, that’ll be cited as total vindication — illegals voted in large-ish numbers! — even though the heart of Trump’s claim, that they voted by the millions and actually changed the outcome of the popular vote, would have been eviscerated. The point, as always, is to convey the sense that Trump is telling hard truths that “they” don’t want you to know about, even when he’s obviously wrong. Update: A Twitter pal notes this paragraph writer by Trump’s own lawyers, from a December filing with Michigan’s Board of Canvassers. They were objecting to Jill Stein’s petition for a recount. ",

        "articles": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott is in process of reminding the Biden administration that the responsibility for securing the southern border lies with the federal government. The State of Texas has been picking up the expenses that incur. Now he is asking county judges to tally up their costs and send him the totals. Abbott says he is going to bill the federal government for the costs. Abbott rightly tells the county judges (not a judicial position, it’s a county’s CEO) that Texans should not be paying for Biden’s border disaster. Several counties have declared states of emergency because they simply do not have the resources to cope with the situation. County and local governments do not have the personnel or funds to take care of the emergencies caused when illegal migrants are dumped into their communities due to a lack of space in shelters. Governor Abbott put Operation Lone Star into place to address border security and safety issues. He deployed air, ground, marine, and tactical border security assets to high threat areas with the mission of combatting human trafficking and drug cartel operations. In his letter to county judges, Abbott reminded them that he also launched an investigation into reports of abuse in some of the shelters housing unaccompanied minors. Governor Abbott will ask the Biden administration for full reimbursement to the State of Texas. TX counties are facing challenges due to the surge in illegal border crossings. Several have declared local disasters. Texans should NOT be forced to shoulder these costs. The federal gov't should reimburse us in full. Read my full letter to county judges across TX: pic.twitter.com/v45NLammT2 — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) April 26, 2021 “Securing the border is the federal government’s responsibility, but the current crisis has placed a costly burden on the State of Texas and on our local governments,” said Governor Abbott. “I have heard from many counties about the challenges they are facing from the surge in illegal border crossings. Several counties have declared local disasters. Other counties have been working around the clock in response to the federal government opening migrant facilities in their counties. I strongly believe that your county, our state, and our fellow Texans should not be forced to shoulder these costs, and that the federal government should reimburse us in full.” The Democrat county judge of Hidalgo County (McAllen) is going a step further. Hidalgo County Judge Richard Cortez is calling on Biden to work on comprehensive immigration reform. When Abbott sent his letter to all 254 county judges asking for “a full and accurate estimate of the fiscal impact of the current border crisis on their counties”, Cortez responded that his staff would put the numbers together but the real solution is immigration reform. Cortez is a retired Mayor of McAllen and a Certified Public Accountant and a Certified Valuation Analyst (CPA/CVA). He addressed the loss of funds available at the local level due to travel restrictions. Cortez points to local sales taxes and revenue losses because Mexican nationals are not able to cross the border and shop as they normally would. He says while he certainly would welcome reimbursements to costs spent in the county for transporting, housing, feeding and testing asylum-seekers for COVID-19, he said he believes Congress needs to enact meaningful changes to the country’s entire immigration policy first and set a clear direction forward. He said appropriating pay-back funds, or passing some immigration reforms that only address part of the ongoing problems, will not get to the root of the overall situation. “We want to make sure that the federal government has a comprehensive immigration plan. We cannot continue to deal in a piecemeal basis and constantly change the policy from time to time, based on the current administration. I believe the United States of America needs a comprehensive immigration plan to determine what our needs are and once determined that is the goal,” Cortez told Border Report on Monday via phone. “In the meantime, we in the border communities are having to deal with it because the government doesn’t have the system in place to test them for COVID,” Cortez said. “They turn them over to our communities.” He’s right – until immigration reform is law, border security is not sustainable. The Trump administration, like administrations before his, tried to work with Congress to pass reforms to the current laws but partisan divides are too deep. Democrats demand blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants already here while Republicans stress accountability and the rule of law. Meanwhile, nothing is accomplished. Biden came into office and immediately ended some successful initiatives and agreements that the Trump administration had in place. Biden’s rash and illogical executive actions have produced a completely predictable humanitarian and public health crisis on the southern border. It is entirely reasonable for Governor Abbott, and other border-state governors, to demand financial reimbursement from the federal government. Cortez, like other Democrats, wants a “fast and efficient way” for illegal immigrants to become legal residents in the United States. That smacks of blanket amnesty and that will not fly with Republicans. Democrats cannot be trusted to uphold their end of any agreements made on illegal immigration, as they proved after the Reagan years when he granted immunity in exchange for immigration law reforms. We know what happened. That mistake can’t happen again. ",

So now I’m the boss, I guess. How ’bout dah? Is her bravado aimed only at right-wing critics of the GND or those on the left as well? She can’t mean to suggest here that she’s the first Democrat to try to move climate-change legislation; her co-sponsor, Ed Markey, actually got a cap-and-trade bill through the House 10 years ago. (The Democratic Senate never brought it to the floor.) As for her belief that she’s “driving the agenda” by having introduced the bill, that’s true but she may be driving it towards a brick wall. Her huge fan following has scared 2020 candidates into backing the plan but the fact that the GND is transparently unworkable makes it useful to the GOP. If the Green New Deal is the only game in town on climate change, or at least the only game in town that’s offering a solution as drastic as progressives believe the problem is, then it’s easy for Republicans to argue that Democrats’ entire global-warming agenda is unworkable and potentially ruinous to American industry. Some liberals are worried that the GND could set back the effort to get Congress to address climate change rather than advance it. The punchline is that if/when Democrats are once again in position to get legislation enacted, there’s like an 80 percent chance that Ocasio-Cortez will vote no on the final bill. Whatever ends up getting through the House will be waaaaaay less ambitious than the GND is. Hardcore Green-Party-style environmentalists will spit that it’s completely unequal to the challenge, a “corporate” bill or whatever, and demand that their favorite congresswoman express their contempt for it through her vote. She won’t disappoint. The best part of the clip, by the way, is how this allegedly existential threat to humanity is framed by AOC in terms of some petty psychodrama about lacking self-confidence. She used to doubt herself, see, but then she achieved self-empowerment by ignoring her critics and putting her bold solutions out there. As if the people complaining (in her words) that “oh it’s unrealistic, oh it’s vague, oh it doesn’t address this little minute thing” about a massive government power grab that would literally revolutionize how the United States functions are just mean girls in the cafeteria looking to tear her down. I thought Kevin Williamson was a little (although only a little) unfair when he wrote of AOC and the GND a few weeks ago that “Sandy’s war is not a struggle over the future of Earth — it is only a struggle over the future of Sandy.” But watching her defend her big proposal here in terms not dissimilar from that, I wonder.

        "articles": "The ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee is fed up with Congressional inactivity on dealing with the crisis on the southern border. During a forum held on family separation at the border Thursday, Rep. Doug Collins abruptly interrupted his own opening statement to get a few things off his chest. Titled “Oversight of Family Separation and U.S. Customs and Border Protection,” the forum was used by Democrats to bring attention to the enforcement of current law on separating children and adults on the border when they are apprehended for crossing the border illegally. After beginning his statement, Collins stopped and said he wouldn’t continue to read his prepared remarks. He called the forum “dehumanizing”, not because of the enforcement of the policy toward the detained individuals but because of the inaction of Congress. Instead of another hearing, or “forum” in this case, Collins said that legislation should be passed. He’s not wrong. As he began to rattle off the numbers of those illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexican border, it was as though he experienced a clarifying moment. It is absurd to continue to hold hearings one after the other and listen to the same witnesses and experts, all the while producing absolutely no legislation to ease the chaos. It is the job of Congress to work out their policy differences and act. Put up a bill. In February, the Border Patrol apprehended 66,000 individuals. That number has been above 92,000 every month since. Peaking at over 132,000 in May alone. You know just last week, I was horrified and deeply affected when Secretary [Kevin] McAleenan told me that there are three ongoing cases where a small group of children, 5 to 8, in each case had been used by dozens of different adults to cross our border seeking release in the US. And my colleagues claim . . . . . . look, I’m gonna stop. I’m not going to read this. You know what is dehumanizing? It’s continuing to bring the same witnesses, or the same people from the same agencies, to talk about this over and over and over again. What’s dehumanizing is doing that and not doing anything about it. That’s what’s dehumanizing. It’s talking about a problem. Talking about a problem. Talking about a problem. And never putting a solution up. And look, my Democratic colleagues have ideas. I may disagree with those ideas, but put a bill up! I have a bill. Put mine up. Make amendments to it, do whatever you want to do. That’s what Congress is supposed to do. What Rep. Collins did was to expose some of the Congressional hearings as stunts. In this case, Democrats want to paint the Trump administration’s decision to enforce a zero-tolerance policy on illegal immigration as “dehumanizing”. The reality is that the administration has little choice. The persistent chaos brought about by thousands of human beings trying to cross over the border in large groups and deliberately overwhelming the resources on the border is not sustainable. President Trump has no intention of allowing open borders to exist. Collins ended by challenging the committee and his colleagues in both parties to do their job. His appeal was for bipartisan legislation instead of press releases. This is becoming, unfortunately, a committee of press releases. That’s it. Dehumanizing is taking people you say you care about but doing nothing for them. That’s dehumanizing. Competent and capable? Last time I understood, Congress should pass legislation. I’ll be very slow. Pass. Bills. That. Matter. Don’t have hearings that are strictly stunts. The August recess is here. Congress will adjourn and members will leave Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the only action the Democratically-controlled House of Representatives has taken to ease the burdens on immigration enforcement agencies and support services at the border is to begrudgingly pass the approval of emergency funding after being shamed into it. The legal loopholes in immigration law have to be addressed, yet neither party is moving forward in progress. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler was the one to first use the term “dehumanizing” in the discussion. He didn’t bother to mention that the Trump administration ended the family separation policy last year. He and the Democrats want to keep the issue alive for campaign purposes in 2020. “Instead of addressing the root causes of migration and competently managing the challenges at our border, the Trump administration has chosen to dehumanize immigrants and exploit this crisis for political gain,” House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in his opening statement. “In doing so, it has violated American laws and values, and caused permanent damage to children and families,” he said. He went on to say that family separation “is just one component of this crisis, as it is clear that conditions at border facilities have deteriorated to an unconscionable level.” The reason “border facilities have deteriorated to an unconscionable level” lies in the fact that the people working on the border are overwhelmed. The resources are only now receiving additional funding to sustain services for those being detained. There is no end in sight. The least that Congress can do is to simply do their jobs and pass legislation to ease the humanitarian crisis. ",

        "urls": "https://hotair.com/archives/2018/06/19/seattle-city-council-passes-plan-turn-city-hall-lobby-homeless-shelter/",
        "articles": "After the recent passage and repeal of the head tax in Seattle, the city’s Mayor is now eager to show some progress on the homeless problem in the city. Toward that end, the Mayor proposed short-term spending to get up to 500 additional people off the street and into various other options including cots set up inside City Hall. The Mayor’s proposal was passed unanimously today by the City Council. From My Northwest: The plan passed Monday gives the city 90 days to expand bridge housing and shelter units by 25 percent. It proposes to serve more than 500 additional people in Seattle each night. It will also help the city to maintain 163 existing shelter beds previously slated to be shut down. The plan also includes expanding shelter at Seattle City Hall by opening the 5th Avenue entrance to house more beds, and funds tiny house villages. “We all have to contribute to solutions to this crisis, which is why we’re opening city hall more people each night,” Durkan said. Last week KOMO News reported more details on the plan to turn the City Hall lobby into a shelter: Part of the plan includes opening the City Hall lobby as an overnight shelter, run by the Salvation Army, starting on June 29. The lobby is large enough for 120 mats that will be used as bedding. This is in addition to the City Hall overnight shelter that has been operating for the last couple of years three floors below. That has the capacity for 60 people spending the night. I could see doing something like this after a natural disaster when people need emergency shelter on a very temporary basis. But the homeless problem in Seattle has been one of the worst in the country for several years and appears to be getting worse. What I don’t see in the Mayor’s plan is the endgame. Of course, the mayor is also talking about building “roughly 2,500 new city-funded affordable rental units and more than 1,900 new multifamily tax exemption units between 2018 to 2021.” What’s not clear is where the money to pay for building and subsidizing those units is going to come from. The $13 million being spent on this short-term emergency plan came from selling off city property. How long can that go on? No, what’s more likely to happen now is the costs of these projects will begin to drain money intended for other things. As one City Council member put it, members of the public “will have to give up things.” “We know how to fix this, it’s deep investment into massive quantities of affordable housing,” Gonzalez said. She also hinted that if no new revenue source becomes available to pay for the ‘deep investment,’ then city projects could be put on hold. “And that inherently means that the public will have to give up things as well,” Gonzalez said. It’s reasonable to ask how enthused Seattle residents are going to be about giving things up (including City Hall) to a homeless population that keeps making news for violent attacks on people in the city. There was another attack by a homeless person on a father and daughter this week: The unidentified victims were on their way to a screening of “The Incredibles 2” when the suspect, David Ailep, allegedly followed the pair as they walked down the sidewalk. When the female victim tried to walk away from Ailep, he said to her “why are you laughing at me” and “stop laughing at me.” She wasn’t laughing at him. According to the police report, obtained by KTTH 770 AM, she asked Ailep to get away from her, but he refused: “She observed that Ailep had his right hand in his pocket (she noted that it looked like was holding a knife in his hand covered by his jacket pocket) and his left hand was up and back in a striking position like he was going to hit her,” the report says. “She feared that he was going to strike her, and she decided to pull out her ASP baton from her purse to defend herself.” The female victim screamed at him to get away from her, but he refused, grabbing both of her arms, and rattling her back and forth until he was able to take the baton from her, according to the police documents. She yelled out in pain. At this point, her father tackled Ailep and wound up getting hit in the head with the stolen baton. Police later arrested Ailep and a nurse determined he was extremely high on drugs at the time of the attack. This is the third serious attack by a homeless person in recent weeks. Earlier this month a homeless man attacked a family of tourists with a rope and his fists. And last month a homeless man was accused of raping a 40-year-old woman in a car dealership bathroom. ",

        "articles": "Cruz himself said this week that the party is risking a “manifest revolt” at the convention if someone besides the top finisher in delegates receives the nomination, but it’s clear in context that he’s thinking of a scenario where an establishment hero like Romney or Rubio is tapped while populist candidates are passed over. His point is simply that party leaders shouldn’t rig the outcome to favor one of their own. Unless I missed it, he’s never suggested it would be inappropriate per se to deny the candidate who finishes with the most delegates. But some of his fans have. John McCormack is mystified by this bit from Glenn Beck. So am I. Beck then argued that the Republican party should roll over and make Trump the nominee even if Trump fails to win a majority of delegates required to win the nomination. “If [Trump] gets close enough and the GOP tries to play games, I won’t vote for Donald Trump ever, but I will stand with his right, because the people have spoken,” [Glenn] Beck said. “You just said you don’t believe it’s fair to deny Donald Trump the nomination if he has the lead going in” to the convention, George Stephanopoulous said a little later in the interview. “Of course not,” Beck replied. Beck argued that “the options of the party playing politics to break us apart at the convention” would lead the party “to civil war on the floor and quite honestly it could lead to civil war in the country.” In this same interview Beck compared Trump to Hitler circa 1929. We owe it to Hitler not to block his path to the nomination, even when he’s failed to satisfy the rule requiring a majority of delegates to win? What? Erick Erickson, another Cruz supporter, made a similar point today: I am very much opposed to Donald Trump and will vote third party if Donald Trump is the GOP nominee, but if he heads to the convention with the most delegates and the GOP does not make him the nominee, I’d call foul on them as well… Trump, though I do not like him, has brought swarms of people into the GOP. Putting out a “No Trump voters allowed” sign is Jim Crowing the GOP — a convention equivalent to segregated water fountains and delegates. The way to beat Trump is to beat him in the primaries and caucuses, not steal from him the nomination when he gets the most votes. Playing cute by saying he needed 1,234 and came up short does not work in the real world when he has the most delegates. Say what now? You won’t be surprised to hear that Trump agrees that the top finisher in delegates before the convention should be the nominee. That’s never been the rule, though. It would have been the simplest thing for the GOP’s Rules Committee to replace the requirement that the nominee have a majority of delegates with one awarding the nomination to whoever has a plurality, which would eliminate the chance of a messy floor fight after the first ballot at the convention. But they didn’t, and as far as I know no one even asked them to. Now here’s what’s important for Cruz fans to understand: As McCormack notes, it’s very unlikely that Ted Cruz will win a clear majority of delegates before the convention. It’s possible that he’ll emerge with a plurality — go look again at how well he does head-to-head with Trump in that WaPo poll this morning, suggesting strength in a two-man race — but he’s behind Trump right now and will be much further behind if Trump wins Ohio and Florida next week. Any Cruz fan who’s calling for the top finisher in delegates to receive the nomination is almost certainly arguing against interest. Why raise the bar for legitimacy for your own guy right as he’s starting to break from the rest of the non-Trump pack? In fact, if you imagine a few different possible delegate scenarios at the convention, you can see why it wouldn’t necessarily be illegitimate to pass Trump over even if he’s the top finisher in delegates. Let’s take these three. (The first two are recycled from a post this weekend.) The latter two here almost certainly require Rubio to win Florida. Scenario one: Trump has 48 percent of the delegates, Cruz has 38 percent, and several candidates who quit the race much earlier have 14 percent. Scenario two: Trump has 40 percent, Cruz has 32 percent, and Marco Rubio has 28 percent. Scenario three: Trump has 37 percent, Cruz has 35 percent, Rubio has 17 percent, and John Kasich has 11 percent. Passing over Trump in the first scenario really would feel like a rip-off. Granted, rules are rules and he failed to achieve a majority, but he’s within two points of the threshold and he’s 10 points better than Cruz. The closer Trump is to 50 and the bigger his lead over the second-place finisher, the more compelling the argument is that he should be the nominee. In the second scenario, then, the case for him is weaker: He’s still comfortably ahead of Cruz but his lead is a bit smaller and he’s not within striking distance of the nomination. Fully 60 percent of the party has split in this case between the two conservative candidates, Cruz and Rubio. To my mind, scenario two would make Cruz plausible as a compromise nominee, avoiding a Trump nomination that would anger the party’s right-wing while also avoiding a Rubio nomination that would anger populists. The party might not hold together but nominating Cruz is your best shot at unifying everyone. In the third scenario, the case for nominating Trump is weak. He’s barely ahead of Cruz and the rest of the party is deeply fractured among three candidates. It may well be that to produce this scenario would require Cruz to win most of the primaries remaining on the schedule, a streak which would feed perceptions that the party has trended towards rejecting Trump. To nominate him anyway per Beck’s and Erickson’s wishes would make Trump fans happy but would antagonize so many anti-Trumpers that Trump might be crippled in the general election right out of the box. You’ve got 63 percent of the party favoring a non-Trump candidate here. If you’re destined to alienate someone, why wouldn’t you rather alienate Trump’s 37 percent than some sizable chunk of that 63? And here’s another thing I don’t understand. Why would a solid #NeverTrumper, which includes Beck and Erickson, insist upon the GOP “playing fair” by nominating Trump if the point of the #NeverTrump movement is to try to sink Trump in the general election? If Trump quit the primaries today and declared himself an independent candidate, presumably the #NeverTrump crowd would rejoice that the GOP was free of him even though it would guarantee Republican defeat in November as Trump’s fans walked away from the party with him. The argument, I guess, is that it’s worth letting Trump have the nomination and lose to Hillary as the duly recognized GOP nominee because at least that’ll show his voters that the party is fair and that they should stick with it even after Trump has passed from the scene. You’re running two big risks with that, though. One: If Beck is right, you’re handing a dangerous authoritarian a much more viable path to the presidency, as a major-party nominee, than he would have as an independent after having been robbed of the GOP nomination. And two: Even if Trump loses to Hillary, you risk having the GOP rebranded as, in Philip Klein’s words, the party of “open-ended government entitlements, socialized medicine, partial birth abortion, gun control, private property seizures, trade protectionism, authoritarianism, vulgarity, mindless policy pronouncements, celebrity worship, and white male resentment.” You could appease pro-Trump populists to some degree by nominating Cruz and letting him rant at the convention about the “Washington cartel.” Given the risks, how is that not preferable to handing Trump the nomination, even when there’s no compelling case for it a la scenario three, and simply hoping for the best? Here’s Rush Limbaugh warning on Sunday about chaos if Trump makes it to Cleveland in the lead and doesn’t get the nomination. Skip to 8:20 for the key bit. ",

        "articles": "Without making a value judgment about the seriousness of these issues to millions of Americans, the importance of leading one of America’s patented “national conversations” about them today – right at this minute – is suspect. As Barack Obama flails in pursuit of a legacy achievement in the form of a dubious nuclear accord with Iran that is only likely to fan the flames of a region already on fire, the timing of the president’s decision to lend his moral weight to the cause of ending gay “conversion” therapy has given his critics justified pause. Obama calls for an end to bad Obama news cycles. — John Ekdahl (@JohnEkdahl) April 9, 2015 “President Obama is calling for an end to such therapies aimed at ‘repairing’ gay, lesbian and transgender youth. His decision on the issue is the latest example of his continuing embrace of gay rights,” The New York Times reported. “We share your concern about its potentially devastating effects on the lives of transgender as well as gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer youth,” the statement, written by Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, says. “As part of our dedication to protecting America’s youth, this administration supports efforts to ban the use of conversion therapy for minors.” In fact, for a man who ostensibly opposed gay marriage less than three years ago, Obama appears determined to set a benchmark standard for LGBT-friendliness. Despite the fact that it will probably be in extremely limited demand, officials announced they are going to create an “all gender bathroom” in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building for the White House staffers who work there. The aim of this new bathroom is to eliminate the stigma transgender people face when confronted with binary lavatories. Don’t expect the Beltway-based reporting class to ask any questions about the number of transgender staffers the White House currently employees. To even ask that question is to offend the principles of identity politics, an altar before which virtually every member of the coastal media elite genuflects. And while the psychological community generally regards gay “conversation” therapy as hokum – Republican Gov. Chris Christie signed a bill banning the practice in his state in 2013 – don’t hold out hope that reporters will prod Democrats over their less scientifically-minded proclivities. The party of rationalism is also the party that has viciously opposed genetically modified food strains that could save millions of lives in the developing world. The party of rationalism is also the party that crafted and signed a law that legitimized and funneled millions of dollars into holistic treatments like acupuncture, chiropractic therapy, and Eastern medicines. “They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,” said scion of the party of science, Robert Kennedy Jr., of the process of vaccination. “This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.” But you won’t hear any of this raised by an incredulous press corps that might find Obama’s apparent deference to scientific consensus opinion on gay “conversion” hard to swallow when his party rejects that consensus on other matters of importance to a greater number of Americans. The point has been made before that what is vogue today is not necessarily the incontrovertible truth. There is nothing wrong with Obama speaking out against the largely discredited practice of gay “conversion” therapy, per se, but it is a mission of a piece with Obama’s claim just yesterday that the latest consequence of climate change is an uptick in the number of asthma sufferers. The president’s design is perfectly transparent to all but his blinkered supporters. His aim is not to address a public policy crisis, but to redirect the national media’s focus towards terrain more favorable to him and his party. The political media, of course, obliges. You will not hear much outrage today in the press over the White House’s objection to signing a bill that makes the administration certify that Iran isn’t committing acts of war against the United States before the sanctions against that nation are lifted. Even though this topic is of objectively more value to more American news consumers than is anything having to do with transgender restroom requirements, to raise this issue is to put Democrats in a bind. Therefore, the press will not raise it. If you have an objective press corps, America, you will hear more than one reporter ask an administration official what the demand is for an “all gender bathroom” for those who work in the White House. If you don’t, you can assume that the political press has collectively determined that this development is both necessary and good, and those asking questions about it are probably bigots. The latter eventuality seems more likely. ",

        "articles": "This makes three top House Republicans who’ve endorsed Ryan in the last two days as a potential uniting force. Yesterday it was Trey Gowdy: “To me, just speaking as one member, the smartest kid in the class is Paul Ryan,” Gowdy said. “If I had one draft choice and I was starting a new country, I would draft Paul to run it. Not because I agree with him on everything, but because he’s super, super smart. And when someone is super, super smart and is not interested, that tells you something. It tells me a lot.” This morning, after he’d formally withdrawn from the Speaker race, it was Kevin McCarthy: It’s not clear who will pick up the pieces. He says, “I personally want Paul Ryan.” There’s been some speculation about the necessity of a bi-partisan coalition to elect a new Speaker, which he rejects. “We’ll find a Republican.” And now, the Speaker himself joins the parade: BREAKING: BOEHNER IS PERSONALLY ASKING RYAN TO STEP UP AND BE SPEAKER, have spoken twice today by phone… — Robert Costa (@costareports) October 8, 2015 Boehner has told Ryan that he is the only person who can unite GOP at this crisis moment. Ryan undecided but listening, per sources — Robert Costa (@costareports) October 8, 2015 And what if Ryan still says no? Terrible things, my friends. Bret Baier: Speaker John Boehner has agreed to stay on as Speaker–not just until the Caucus nominates someone –but, until that person can confirm 218 votes on the House floor (needed to take the Speaker’s gavel). Short of that – Boehner will stay on for the rest of this Congress and steer legislation that is pending. What does this mean? Moderates and leadership types are cheering and saying Boehner is the only one they will support. Conservatives will go ballistic since they know this signals that Boehner will make ALL kinds of deals to get big ticket legislation through the House even if it means using Democrats votes to do it. Hopefully that’s just a bluff Boehner is using to twist the arms of House conservatives who’d otherwise object to another center-right Speaker. Line up behind Ryan, Boehner is saying, or else I’ll stick around and make your lives even more miserable. What his leverage is in doing that isn’t immediately clear to me; wasn’t the whole reason he quit in the first place because he wasn’t sure he had the votes to survive the challenge being led by Rep. Mark Meadows to oust him? But maybe this little nudge will be enough to convince the Freedom Caucus to give Ryan a shot. Grassroots conservatives might not like that, as Ryan’s lost plenty of goodwill with them from his chumminess with Boehner and his 2013 budget deal with Patty Murray, but he seems to be well respected by most House tea partiers. I bet he’d get to 218 if he ran. I bet Romney’s leaning on him privately too to answer the call of duty too. Maybe Ryan will compromise and agree to serve but only until through the end of the election, to give the two wings of the party in the House time to reconcile and find a consensus choice. Stay tuned. Update: And then there were two. Sr. House aide tells me private, ongoing chatter suggests only 2 names can win requisite votes w/ chance to heal caucus: Ryan & Gowdy… — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) October 8, 2015 …and that intensive efforts to convince Paul Ryan to run are heating up, despite his consistent refusals… — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) October 8, 2015 A little more intrigue: SCOOP: Paul Ryan has canceled all of his fundraisers for the next 48 hours. — Anna Palmer (@apalmerdc) October 8, 2015 Update: Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.

        "articles": "Yesterday, the Charlottesville Police Department closed its investigation into the reports of a gang rape at the University of Virginia reported by Rolling Stone last year, as well as allegations of a “rape culture” levied by Sabrina Rubin Erdely in the long-discredited article. They found no evidence that the fraternity at the center of the accusation even had any event on the night in question, and declared that no evidence emerged that supported the broader accusations against UVa. Police chief Timothy Longo also told the media that “Jackie,” the accuser at the heart of Erdely’s reporting, refused to cooperate with the investigation, and that the witnesses they found did not support any part of the story she and Erdely told. What lessons arise from this utter collapse of a narrative created by Erdely and Rolling Stone that could have come straight out of 17th-century Salem, or the McMartin Preschool trial? Erik Wemple shows no mercy in his journalistic post-mortem: What is left of the Rolling Stone piece? Very little. There’s some reporting on the university’s culture, which shouldn’t be taken seriously in light of the fraud exposed by the police; there’s some reporting on the university leadership’s approach to the issue, which shouldn’t be taken seriously in light of the fraud exposed by the police; there’s some reporting on an old rape case, which pretty much holds up, but, again…. Though Longo is not paid as a media critic, his statements make clear that Rolling Stone propagated a biased work built on a mix of naivete and advocacy. As we’ve written before, Rolling Stone personnel should lose employment over this disaster. Instapundit posted a letter from a journalist who wishes to remain anonymous, who worries about the turn toward advocacy and away from skepticism in first-person reporting. Don’t expect media outlets to learn a lesson from this, the reporter warns: You might be interesting in this Tip Sheet from Columbia’s Dart Center: Note how from the very first paragraph the tip sheet assumes that anyone making a complaint is a “survivor,” not an “alleged victim” or other neutral language. Nowhere do these guidelines say “Be sure to give the alleged perpetrator or his/her representatives a chance to respond to the allegations.” But they do say: “Listening is important. Make sure to allow ample time for the source to tell you their story. Don’t rush them. Don’t press for details if they are not willing. Allow them to tell you what they feel comfortable talking about.” Columbia’s J-school is finishing an outside investigation of the Erdely article and its publication at the invitation of Rolling Stone’s editors. If this is the standard to which they hold the magazine, Rolling Stone will have no problem accepting the endorsement. The journalist expects J-school dean Steve Coll to rethink the standard. We’ll see. At first blush, it’s hard to see where Coll can fault Erdely or Rolling Stone. The problem goes deeper than the reporting, though. Gregory Wallance, a former federal prosecutor writing for USA Today, gets close to the mark: But the U.Va. incident says less about a journalistic rush to judgment than it does about a misguided federal policy to deter campus sexual assaults that is sowing chaos on campuses. Universities and colleges, as witnessed by U.Va., have been in an impossible damned if you do, damned if you don’t position, ever since the U.S. Department of Education’sannouncement on April 4, 2011 that, under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, any college or university receiving federal aid will be held accountable for failing to deter and punish campus sexual assaults. … One problem is that the Title IX policy rests on the flawed premise that institutions of higher learning are good at law enforcement. But no one would expect a university to investigate and prosecute a campus murder, yet sexual assault cases, especially rape, are just as challenging, if not more so, as illustrated by the Charlottesville Police Department’s experience. The predictable inability of academic institutions to act as a combined police force, prosecutor’s office and court has led to extraordinary frustration and fury by students. Dozens of lawsuits are pending against schools by students alleging that their claims of sexual violence were mishandled and by students alleging that the accusations against them were unfairly adjudicated. Indeed, U.Va. waspilloried across the country for not having done more to stop a fraternity rape that may never have occurred. Universities and colleges, including the most elite institutions, are in over their heads, as witness their unworkable sex policies. It’s actually much more basic than Wallance suggests. The pressure put on universities and colleges by the Obama administration to use a low evidentiary standard and confusing definitions of criminality has had the effect of standing basic American jurisprudence on its head. Instead of allowing a presumption of innocence and the accused to face and question his accusers, the process assumes guilt and blocks even the most elementary of defense options. As I write in my column for The Week, the biggest contribution made by the Charlottesville PD is their admission that they can’t prove a negative: And yet, as Longo noted, their investigation couldn’t definitively prove that nothing traumatic had happened to Jackie on that night in September 2012. They could demonstrate that Jackie had given false information in her story, but that was all. That’s the real lesson from the Charlottesville investigation. It’s impossible to prove a negative — and that’s why we have the protections afforded us through due process when it comes to allegations of criminality. Activists, abetted by the Obama administration’s pressure on schools to increase disciplinary actions for sexual harassment and assault, have pushed schools into using incredibly low standards of evidence in administrative hearings, while denying the accused opportunities to confront accusers, examine witnesses and evidence, or even put on an effective defense. In too many cases, those accused on college campuses find themselves in the impossible position of proving negatives. Instead of having normal due process, they find themselves in kangaroo courts, with their lives ruined on the basis of mere allegation. Yes, Erdely’s Rolling Stone article is a “crock,” as Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple puts it. But so are attempts to have schools conduct witch hunts against people about whom nothing has been proven. We need to end presumptions of guilt and denial of due process now, and leave criminal investigations in the hands of professionals — like the Charlottesville Police Department — and not activists in pursuit of their own political goals. It’s time to put an end to the latest moral panic, and put the Department of Education on a tight leash when it comes to Title IX. ",

        "articles": "Some new media critics really need to make up their minds. It’s either a Do Nothing Congress or a Do Something Awful Congress. If you ask the folks at Talking Points Memo, we’ll be leaning toward the latter because the House was getting busy taking care of business before half of the new members had located the bathrooms. A minor rules change was put in place which modifies the way tax revenues are occasionally shuffled between the Social Security trust fund and the Social Security disability program. There’s a reason for this, as we’ll get to below, but to hear some of the folks on the Left describe it, Paul Ryan had finally succeeded in pushing granny’s wheelchair off that cliff. With a little-noticed proposal, Republicans took aim at Social Security on the very first day of the 114th Congress. The incoming GOP majority approved late Tuesday a new rule that experts say could provoke an unprecedented crisis that conservatives could use as leverage in upcoming debates over entitlement reform… House Democrats are sounding the alarm. In a memo circulated to their allies Tuesday, Democratic staffers said that that would mean “either new revenues or benefit cuts for current or future beneficiaries.” New revenues are highly unlikely to be approved by the deeply tax-averse Republican-led Congress, leaving benefit cuts as the obvious alternative. All that’s missing is a catchy graphic of a skeletal figure riding a pale horse with the letters GOP printed on his robes. So, all anti-conservative hysteria aside, what’s really going on here? The rules change will still allow for a transfer of funds from the retirement fund to the disability program if required (which it will be by 2016 under current conditions) but only if it improves the overall financial health of the combined Social Security Trust Funds. Scary stuff, I know. I’ll give you all a moment to make it back from your fainting couches. So it doesn’t actually mandate any cuts or taxes, but far more likely will shine some daylight on one of the many known issues with these programs… fraud. The Left has been repeating a now discredited mantra for a long time now, namely that fraud is almost non-existent in the disability program, which has ballooned out of control since massive numbers of workers have dropped out of the labor market during the “Obama recovery.” The reality, of course, is far different. The Office of the Inspector General released a report just this past September providing details of one single set of arrests in Puerto Rico where nearly 100 people were found to be bilking the system for millions. A more comprehensive study from the same month detailed multiple investigations in the mainland United States, including a single individual in New York who had defrauded the disability system for more than $400,000.00 just between him and his wife. This prompted Congressman Sam Johnson to say: “This program cannot afford more fraud… all taxpayers and beneficiaries will shoulder the burden of this crime wave.” There are plenty of places where improvements can be made in the system, and some of them will eventually involve some serious restructuring if the intestinal fortitude to do it can be found in Congress. But at this stage of the game, a modest start to the process could be made by simply insisting that the government do a better job in policing the program, rooting out as much of the fraud as can be identified, and saving that money for the legitimate beneficiaries who count on it. Unfortunately, any effort to save the system from eventually imploding will be fought tooth and claw by liberals in Congress and in the media, depicting it as “yet another” attempt by the GOP to throw seniors off the cliff.

        "articles": "More than a year after the terrorist attack in Benghazi claimed the lives of four Americans, including the first American ambassador killed in the line of duty in 33 years, critics of the Obama administration like to point out that none of the terrorists have been apprehended, but the filmmaker that the White House scapegoated still sits in prison. The latter half of that argument becomes moot today, as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula/Mark Basseley Youssef will officially exit federal custody: The man behind a film that stoked anti-U.S. protests across the Muslim world was due for release from federal custody in California on Thursday after serving time for probation violations stemming from his role in making the video. The 56-year-old Egyptian-born Coptic Christian, Mark Basseley Youssef, gained public notice for the crudely made 13-minute anti-Islam video he produced in Southern California that portrayed the Prophet Mohammad as a fool and sexual deviant. The film, circulated online under several titles including “The Innocence of Muslims,” touched off a torrent of anti-American demonstrations in Arab and Muslim countries, where many consider any depiction of the Prophet as blasphemous. The start of the unrest on September 11, 2012, coincided with an attack on U.S. diplomatic posts in the Libyan city of Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya. Links between the Benghazi assault and Youssef’s film have since been debunked. Yes they have, although it took a concerted effort to get the White House and State Department to finally admit it. They sent then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice out to do the full Ginsburg on Sunday talk shows to spin that fairy tale, even in one instance on the same program where the president of Libya tried to explain that it was a terrorist attack. The purveyor of that debunked, fraudulent claim now works as National Security Adviser to the President, of course. While the claim was still extant, though, federal officials seized Youssef/Nakoula from his house in my home town of Cerritos, California. The Reuters account has federal officials changing the context just a tad: Youssef, a former gasoline station owner who previously served time for a 2010 bank fraud conviction, was sent back to prison last year after admitting that he breached the terms of his probation in connection with the making of the film. Federal prosecutors insisted his arrest last September had nothing to do with the film’s content but with conduct that violated the terms of his probation, such as his use of aliases and the Internet, in the course of making the video. Really? Had nothing to do with the film, eh? I guess federal officials make bad cinema on YouTube a high priority, just on the off chance that indie filmmakers might be violating parole. The timing of the targeting of Nakoula shows that this claim is nonsense, anyway. Federal and local law enforcement swarmed Nakoula’s neighborhood in Cerritos to detain him on September 15th, the day before Susan Rice offered a fairy tale to the American public rather than level with us about the nature of the terrorist attack. He didn’t get formally arrested until twelve days later, when Allahpundit wrote this: No word yet on what the violation was, but I assume it must be far more serious than using an alias or a computer. Given the insanity of the past two weeks, replete with the White House nudging Google to pull the video off of YouTube and the State Department running ads on Pakistani TV to apologize for a movie they had nothing to do with, I can’t quite believe the DOJ would risk the perception that they’re punishing this guy for a thoughtcrime unless something serious was involved. There has to be a real crime underlying this. Right? As it turned out … no. Nakoula will have spent a year minus one day in official federal custody for parole violations, which would be understandable had those come to light before the White House and State Department set him up as a scapegoat for their own failures. Now he’s out and on four years of probation. Can we now get some real answers as to how we let Benghazi fall, and start holding people accountable — other than producers of laughably bad cinema? ",

        "articles": "The primary’s less than two weeks away. Hatch is still a strong favorite to win in Utah. If the tea party’s going to make a splash this cycle, this is their very best chance. Time to rally the troops. I join commonsense conservatives in endorsing Richard Mourdock to be the next Senator from Indiana. Conservatives of all stripes are uniting behind Richard Mourdock. It’s not just Indiana that benefits from sending the right Senator to serve for the right reasons; the nation as a whole benefits, and that is one reason why the eyes of so many around the nation are focused on the Indiana race. Indiana deserves a conservative in the Senate who will fight for the Hoosier State, uphold our Constitution, and not just go along to get along with the vested interests of the permanent political class in D.C. Richard Mourdock is the conservative choice for Indiana. Senator Lugar’s 36 years of service as a Senator are appreciated, but it’s time for the torch to pass to conservative leadership in Washington that promises to rein in government spending now. Get the facts here. Learn more about Richard Mourdock at www.richardmourdock.com and follow him on Facebook and Twitter. Good call by Palin. Citizens United released a poll yesterday showing Mourdock leading by five thanks to a 63/24 split in his favor among tea partiers. Victory here is distinctly possible if those voters turn out; this endorsement will help make that happen, and if it does she’ll get some credit for it. And if not, she’ll get no blame: Remember, both Romney and Mitch Daniels have endorsed Lugar so he’s gotten the Republican establishment’s gold-star seal of approval. As such, if he squeaks through it’ll be no surprise, just a moral victory for grassroots conservatives in making a close race of it instead of an actual victory. For Palin, it’s a smart way to start positioning herself as a counterweight to/critic of Romney on the right. She can’t be too hard on him during the campaign since job one for all Republicans is beating Obama, so she and other tea partiers will have to find subtler ways to signal principled disagreement. This is one way to do it. Here’s her old running mate inadvertently demonstrating the difference between them. Exit question: Is an endorsement of Dan Liljenquist over Orrin Hatch coming next? I’m guessing … no. ",

        "articles": "Via the Corner, here’s Clinton errand boy Serpenthead demonstrating how right I was last week in thinking the new Democratic spin on E-mailgate is “who gives a sh*t?” There’s a saying among lawyers that when the facts are on your side, argue the facts; when the facts are against you, argue the law; and when both the facts and the law are against you, pound the table. The facts are against Carville. Hillary didn’t even make a pretense of proper e-mail protocol by setting up an official State Department account, and she didn’t turn over e-mails from her private account until two years after leaving office. (That’s a key difference between her and Jeb Bush, as is the fact that Clinton’s e-mail likely included sensitive natsec info on a regular basis.) The law is against him too. It’s been State Department policy since 2005 to conduct official state business on official state e-mail, a policy reinforced by Hillary’s own directives as Secretary. (That’s a key difference between her and Colin Powell, who left the State Department early that year.) So enjoy eight minutes of Carville pounding the table, insisting that notorious conservative media outlets like the New York Times and MSNBC (and Gawker?) are once again cooking up nothingburgers about the Clintons based on trumped up right-wing talking points. This guy actually has the balls at one point to offer the old complaint that there’s one set of rules for the Clintons and one for everybody else as a complaint on their behalf, as though the Clintons are routinely held to a higher standard than average pols rather than a lower one. Think about that. The diplomatic wing of the United States government admitted last week that it has no idea whether its archive of Obama’s first term is complete because its access to Hillary’s work product is completely under her control. You’d go to prison if you withheld sensitive information like that. As it is, Hillary’s (probably) going to the White House. And this jackhole can’t stop whining about how hard the Clintons have it and how unfair the media is. Make sure you watch the clip in Ed’s post of fellow Clinton errand boy Lanny Davis echoing many of these same who-gives-a-sh*t points, which is proof enough that Team Hillary has sent around a script to its most reliable toadies. Ed raises a good point by e-mail too: If there’s a script, why not have Her Majesty sit for an interview with someone and run through it herself? Why farm it out to unctuous water-carriers like Davis and Carville? What makes it even odder is that reporters have gotten less shy lately about calling out tiresome spin doctors like those two and David Brock on their filibustering. Chris Wallace all but called Davis an errand boy in their interview; Andrea Mitchell barely seems to be taking Carville seriously here. When you invite a Clinton mega-shill on, you know you’re not going to get the truth or even artful spin, you’re going to get pure, straight, who-gives-a-sh*t combativeness. (The ultimate example may be Phillippe Reines, who usually does his screaming at reporters off-camera.) That’s a weird difference between Hillary toadies and Obama toadies like Robert Gibbs or David Axelrod, who managed to carry O’s water without reaching that frenetic level of defensiveness that characterizes so many of Hillary’s most irritating lackeys. Can’t wait to have all these people close to the seat of power again. Update: Good point by Matt Lewis about the mega-shillery for Hillary by Davis, Carville, and Brock. Don’t the Clintons have any Democrats willing to carry their water who aren’t retreads from 20 years ago? One of the reasons the media’s losing patience with them is that they’ve been hearing the same crap from these same three guys literally for decades. Surely there must be someone who wasn’t in politics in the 1990s who’s equally willing to fall on a grenade for Hillary. Note to Team Clinton: If you don’t want Hillary being called “old news,” find some surrogates who aren’t themselves old news. ",

        "articles": "There’s some additional bad news out there for the “party of science” (as the Democrats have taken to calling themselves) and particularly for transgender advocates. But even if you have no interest in such social justice topics, a new study published by geneticists in Israel is still pretty fascinating. The Liberty Council has a report this week on new research material coming from Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science, where scientists have undertaken an exhaustive study of genetic differences between the two genders which go far beyond just what’s found in their 23rd chromosomal pair or what sorts of genitalia they display externally. And some of this research could have far reaching implications in terms of fighting diseases and solving other medical mysteries on top of sorting out this “gender vs sex” question which liberals keep trying to push. A recent study released from Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science refutes propaganda from LGBT activists who detach gender completely from sex and promote that men can become so-called “women” by merely “identifying” as female, and vice-versa. Professor Shmuel Pietrokovski and Dr. Moran Gershoni, both researchers from the Weizmann Institute’s Molecular Genetics Department, “looked closely at around 20,000 protein-coding genes, sorting them by sex and searching for differences in expression in each tissue. They eventually identified around 6,500 genes with activity that was biased toward one sex or the other in at least one tissue, adding to the already major biological differences between men and women.” You can access the study here in .pdf form and browse through it. They discovered all manner of fascinating things, some of which seem obvious in retrospect while others are quite surprising. They identified specific genes which are directly associated with hair growth in skin cells. These genes are far more widespread in men than women, showing up in different places. (The result of that should be obvious.) One of the more surprising developments (at least to me) came in the area of mammary glands. Both males and females have all of the “equipment” to support lactation, but it’s almost never seen in men. The study identified specific genes in men which apparently turn off that process since it’s not needed. Some others would be easier to predict, such as higher levels of muscle building genes in men as opposed to higher levels of genes which are related to fat storage in women. The list goes on. But mostly, this is just one more brick in the wall for the folks who seem to insist on “listening to the scientists” except when it’s inconvenient to do so. Whenever this debate comes up, someone inevitably tries to point to a single study done years ago hinting that the brain waves of transgender people match those of people of the opposite sex. But further research showed that those results couldn’t be reliably repeated under laboratory conditions. To boot, experts in the field have already admitted that they can’t tell a male brain from a female brain in those scans to begin with. By comparison, any deep dive into readily measurable and repeatable genetic studies shows the true nature of our species, as well as the striking and generally wonderful difference between our two genders which are established basically at the moment of conception.

        "articles": "Hot Air is pleased to provide Senator Marco Rubio with an opportunity to speak directly to voters in this guest column. One of conservatism’s highest priorities must always be to defend the timelessness of our people’s fundamental rights. The right to life, the right to religious liberty, the right to bear arms – these rights have no expiration date. Instead, their importance increases with the passage of time. Sometimes, because it is so rarely discussed, it is easy to forget one of the other basic rights our government was established to defend, and that is the right to property. Though it may not make headlines as often as other issues, the fundamental right to private property has been under assault for years through our government’s abuses of eminent domain. Eminent domain is the authority vested in government to force the sale of private property. While this authority can be a necessary evil in rare cases related to public development, such as the building of crucial infrastructure, its modern use far exceeds this limitation. Today, it is often wielded by crony capitalist politicians to benefit wealthy and powerful private developers. One of my proudest accomplishments as a public servant was leading the effort in Florida to pass both a law and a constitutional amendment to keep private developers from using eminent domain to take property away from private owners. This effort became necessary after the egregiously flawed Kelo v. New London Supreme Court decision made private use of eminent domain legal unless states banned it. In the years since, the legislation I passed in the Florida House has become a model for states across the country. As a result of these reforms, Florida now has some of the strongest laws in the nation protecting homes, businesses, and even houses of worship from being seized by private developers. This effort earned the state of Florida an “A” grade from the Castle Coalition, which is a nationwide organization established to defend private property from undue seizure. Like the defense of other crucial rights, conservative efforts to defend private property are grounded deep in the history of our nation. In fact, abuses of this right were one of the catalysts for the American Revolution. As the first Continental Congress declared, “[The colonists] are entitled to life, liberty and property: and they have never ceded to any foreign power … a right to dispose of either without their consent.” After being founded, in part, to protect these rights, our government has strayed far from this purpose. Compromise after compromise from elected officials in both parties has resulted in a government that believes it has the power to seize your property and sell it to rent-seeking private interests. When I am president, through the justices I nominate to the Supreme Court and the legislation I sign into law, I will stand firmly against the abuse of eminent domain. Hot Air will be happy to provide other presidential candidates an open forum for guest essays as well. ",

        "articles": "Page Six published a lengthy piece yesterday about Katie Couric’s time as the face of Yahoo News. The goal was to hire Couric and make Yahoo a rival to the big network newscasts without the benefit of television. It didn’t quite work out that way. One of the problems was that Couric and her team of TV producers weren’t immediately treated like stars by the team of experienced print journalists that Yahoo had already assembled. In the spring of 2014, Yahoo moved into the old New York Times building in Times Square. Couric’s crew sat in a cluster on one side of the newsroom, and on the other side, separated by a bank of elevators, was the team belonging to Megan Liberman, the editor in chief of Yahoo News… Some of the “serious journalists” on Liberman’s team regarded Couric as a “TV person” who did cooking segments and “got colonoscopies on TV,’’ referring to Couric’s groundbreaking 2000 “Today” show segment… Couric and her producers — seasoned in the world of TV, where big interviews are naturally done by the largest on-air talent — often expected that when the star journalists on Liberman’s team landed big “gets,” such as a sit-down with then-President Barack Obama, Couric would be the one to do the interview. Liberman’s team had other ideas. The result was a mixed bag of interviews. Couric sometimes garnered big numbers and at other times struggled to find an audience. At times, her numbers were so low that Yahoo eventually removed the traffic counter from the video page. Couric, by any measure, had some smash hits at Yahoo. One was her interview with Stephen Collins, the “7th Heaven” actor who in December 2014 admitted to sexually abusing underage girls. As The Wall Street Journal noted at the time, Couric’s exclusive confessional racked up 5 million views — more than “half of a typical evening news audience, bigger than the average cable news audience, and about twice the views of the best-performing video on CNN.com, the No. 2 player in online news after Yahoo.”… But for every Stephen Collins-type piece, there were others that got such little traffic that Yahoo worried the low numbers — in the tens of thousands rather than hundreds of thousands or millions — would embarrass its global anchor and spook its advertisers. Multiple sources said Yahoo eventually removed the publicly visible view-counters from its now-shuttered video platform, Yahoo Screen, just to save face. The article goes on to make the case that this wasn’t all or even primarily Couric’s fault. When she had been hired by other networks, those networks had invested millions of dollars in promoting her as a leading part of their brand. Yahoo paid Couric a significant salary ($5 million, though much of that was in Yahoo stock) but the company spent almost nothing promoting her or her work. As a result, she often got lost in the mix. In addition, Yahoo used an algorithm designed to feed its users more of whatever they were searching for online. So people searching for news were shown more news. But according to Page Six, Yahoo’s algorithm treated all news sources the same, meaning that Yahoo’s original news content got no push from the site. Couric was treated as just another face in the news crowd. Not mentioned in the story are some major missteps Couric made in her career during her tenure at Yahoo. In 2016 a pro-gun control documentary she narrated and executive produced was found to have manipulated footage to make it appear that a group of gun rights supporters were unable to answer Couric’s simple question. In fact, the group had answered her but the director cut that out and left a 9-second pause. Couric was aware of the manipulation as she had seen a cut of the film before its release. Couric later offered an apology of sorts. She was sued for defamation over the edit but a judge ruled the scene was not defamatory. Nevertheless, it wasn’t a good look for Yahoo’s global news anchor. Couric left Yahoo in 2017, about a year after the controversy erupted. ",

        "articles": "Via the Examiner, I’d do what they say. In our alarming new culture of rage against microaggressions, doing otherwise might get you shot. Rather than make brutish assumptions that someone who looks like a boy is a boy and someone who looks like a girl is a girl, the campus diversity office recommends starting the semester by asking everyone to provide their names “and pronouns.” Or better yet, why not just use new pronouns that are gender-neutral? It’ll spare you an ephemeral awkward moment when you happen to encounter someone from the tiny fraction of the tiny fraction of the population that not only identifies as trans but doesn’t want to be referred to by the pronoun of the gender they physically appear to be. Not to play this stupid game, but I’m curious: Why does “they/them/their” turn into “xe/xem/xyr” instead of the more logical “zey/zem/zeir”? Also, why isn’t “they/them/their” proper usage for someone who’s trans, whether singular or plural? I mean, purely in terms of how it scans, “xyr” is an abomination. Also, I’m not sure I grasp the difference between “hir/hirs” and “zir/zirs.” Which one should you use for Caitlyn Jenner? One, I think, is for a man who identifies as a woman and the other for a woman who identifies as a man, but I’ll be damned if I know which terms applies to which. The whole point of this exercise, I thought, was not to make any judgments about gender based on appearance. Doesn’t the need to choose between “hir” and “zir” force you to do that? Either way, with respect to Caitlyn, looks increasingly like ze’s going to prison. ",

        "articles": "If you’re one of the people who are crazy enough to venture out onto the streets of New York City this week (or simply can’t avoid it for professional reasons) and you’re unlucky enough to collapse on the sidewalk from a heart attack, I suppose all we can say is it’s been nice knowing you. Under new guidelines issued by the state Health Department, paramedics finding people in a state of cardiac arrest without a heartbeat are not supposed to go through the usual routines of attempting to restart the patient’s heart and respiration. In other words, assuming you are seen by an EMT who is following this guideline, once you’re dead you’re supposed to politely remain on your trip to the afterlife. While paramedics were previously told to spend up to 20 minutes trying to revive people found in cardiac arrest, the change is “necessary during the COVID-19 response to protect the health and safety of EMS providers by limiting their exposure, conserve resources, and ensure optimal use of equipment to save the greatest number of lives,’’ according to a state Health Department memo issued last week. First responders were outraged over the move. “They’re not giving people a second chance to live anymore,’’ Oren Barzilay, head of the city union whose members include uniformed EMTs and paramedics, fumed of state officials. Particularly in New York City, this isn’t the first such policy change to be issued. The Regional Emergency Services Council of New York (which is responsible for overseeing ambulance services in the Big Apple) issued an even more stern directive. Cardiac patients whose hearts could not be restarted on the scene are no longer supposed to be taken to a hospital “for further life-saving attempts.” But under those guidelines, you at least still could get twenty minutes of effort to restart your ticker where they found you. If you combine these two directives together, you’re pretty much out of luck. If your heart stops, you’re a casualty of the war against the novel coronavirus. But you may not have to worry about it. The FDNY responded by issuing a statement saying that they would continue to offer the same levels of medical response service that they have in the past. There’s a part of me that almost understands a move like this, at least in theory. On the one hand, the first responders are already overwhelmed. And as tough as their jobs already are, now they have to worry if the guy collapsed on the street is contagious with the virus. A desire by the state to keep them safe is at least laudable in that regard. Also, while New York was never as fully overwhelmed as some originally feared, the number of ICU beds available at some of the hospitals is still down near zero on some days, primarily because of COVID-19 patients. But if you’ve ever listened to any of the near-death experiencers (NDE) out there, you know that’s it’s not a minor matter for them. Those few people who have shuffled off this mortal coil only to be dragged back to the world of the living generally come away from the experience with profound, life-altering views. And we’re still not entirely sure where that line between life and death is drawn anyway. If you can revive someone who has flatlined for several minutes, what was their condition during that time? Were they really, technically “dead?” If we’re to accept that, we must suggest that they were then resurrected, and that raises all sorts of philosophical and religious issues. We should probably leave these decisions up to the individual paramedics who are out there on the front lines. If they can save a life, you just know that they’re going to want to try. Otherwise, why would they be in that profession to begin with? ",

        "articles": "No one will be busy in Washington DC on January 20, right? No social events on the calendar? According to a new memo from Mitch McConnell and given to the Washington Post, any impeachment trial of Donald Trump would begin at the earliest on that day, no sooner than 1 pm ET — an hour after Trump won’t need to be removed from office anyway. The Senate can’t do any substantive business until January 19th by rule, the memo explains, and it would take unanimous consent to change that rule: Although the Senate will hold two pro forma sessions next week, on Jan. 12 and Jan. 15, it is barred from conducting any kind of business during those days — including “beginning to act on received articles of impeachment from the House” — without agreement from all 100 senators. With a cadre of Trump-allied senators in the Republican conference, that unanimous consent is highly unlikely. “Again, it would require the consent of all 100 Senators to conduct any business of any kind during the scheduled pro forma sessions prior to January 19, and therefore the consent of all 100 Senators to begin acting on any articles of impeachment during those sessions,” the memo from McConnell emphasized. In effect, that makes the matter of an impeachment trial an issue that will need to be taken up by Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming majority leader, in the first days of the Biden presidency — a move that would almost certainly distract from the president-elect’s immediate agenda to battle the coronavirus pandemic and ensure that his Cabinet nominees get confirmed. Of course, all this assumes that the House will impeach Trump in the first place. They can do business before January 19th, and at least one article of impeachment will come to the floor on Monday for incitement to insurrection. Nancy Pelosi would need to get a simple majority for that if she moves through regular order, but might need two-thirds if she bypasses regular order to speed things up. It’s almost impossible that Pelosi would get two-thirds in a House that had two-thirds of Republicans voting to uphold the pointless elector challenges. But going through regular order might mean that Pelosi wouldn’t get it done by the 15th either. The question of unanimous consent in the Senate might never even come up. If not, or if a Senate Republican objects to conducting business before the 19th (and you can bet that Tommy Tuberville or Josh Hawley would), then this is what the schedule would look like, according to McConnell: ●On Jan. 19, the Senate would receive a message from the House that it has appointed impeachment managers, and that the Senate would be ready to receive it. ●On Jan. 19 or 20, the House impeachment managers would exhibit the articles. ●On Jan. 20 or 21, the Senate would proceed to consideration of the impeachment articles at 1 p.m., and officially begin the trial. McConnell’s memo noted that the “Senate trial would therefore begin after President Trump’s term has expired — either one hour after its expiration on January 20, or twenty-five hours after its expiration on January 21.” That might seem rather pointless, as Trump won’t be in the office at that point to be removed from it. However, an impeachment affords Congress the opportunity to bar Trump from any federal office in the future (as it does for impeachments of other federal officials), and that might be enough to pursue impeachment, especially for Democrats. That does raise another question, though: can Congress impeach a private citizen who is no longer in federal office? The answer is — no one really knows. A year ago there was some significant debate over that point, but the only real consensus is that there is no consensus, and even more to the point, no certainty even among those who have an opinion. The Constitution provides Congress the authority to impeach presidents and vice presidents, judges, and “all civil officers” in Article II Section 4, an explicit list which would seem to preclude anyone who isn’t currently in one of those categories. Arguably, any such effort against a private citizen could conceivably be considered an act of attainder, which is explicitly prohibited by Article I, Sections 9 and 10. Under that theory, any prosecutorial action would have to take place in civil courts and not Congress. But until Congress tries it and the result gets challenged in court, it remains a mystery … sort of like presidential self-pardons. Let’s say for the sake of argument Congress decides it can retroactively impeach a former civil officer. Why do it? If it can’t be done to get Trump out of office before he arguably does something crazy or destructive in the Wagnerian Wotan-burning-down-Valhalla sense, then there’s no point except to bar him from future office. And if that’s the only purpose, that not only changes the politics of the situation, but also means it doesn’t need to take place now anyway. Why not wait until March or April, or the summer? There’s no rush at all, as long as it gets done before the 2024 primary cycle begins in, er … July of this year. I kid, I kid … If all this sounds like it’s more trouble than it’s worth, that’s because it is. The only legitimate purpose for removing Trump at this point is to ensure he can’t do anything crazy over the next twelve days. If Congress can’t get to it before Day 12, then it’s an empty tactic, one that could stoke an even bigger reaction just as Joe Biden is taking the oath of office. Better to just remind him that prosecutorial options remain open for any abuses that Trump might commit over the next fortnight, and then pay Pat Cipollone a bonus for two weeks of combat duty. ",

        "articles": "A tough, focused, relentless cross-examination of the Secretary of State by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton — an Iraq war veteran and a graduate of Harvard Law School. The clip is relatively short, and the whole thing is worth your time: Cotton makes the most of his frustratingly limited time, zeroing in on a handful of key points: (1) Cotton makes clear that the Corker/Cardin legislation, which was signed into law by President Obama, requires that Congress receive every single word of the finalized Iran deal. Having discovered and confirmed the existence of secret side agreements within the overall accord, Cotton wonders whether or how the administration will adhere to that provision of the law. Kerry responds that such matters must be classified in order to respect the privacy of the IAEA. Cotton’s framing is stark and outstanding: “The Ayatollahs will know what they agreed to, but not the American people.” Brutal. (2) The Arkansas Senator drills down on reports that Iran may be permitted to provide its own soil samples as part of an important nuclear “inspection,” likening this alleged concession to allowing an athlete to submit a urine sample for a drug test without supervision. Kerry says that the US government is “satisfied” that this arrangement — which he’ll neither confirm nor deny — will “provide the answers we need.” The Associated Press quoted a nuclear expert casting doubt on that claim yesterday, arguing that the process in question may not prevent Iran from tampering with the sample they turn over. (3) With Gen. Dempsey’s help, Cotton demonstrates that Iran is chiefly responsible for providing specialized IEDs to terrorist insurgents in Iraq, who have used the deadly devices to kill hundreds of American soldiers. Cotton’s point is obvious: This is a regime with a great deal of American blood on its hands and whose leaders still chant “death to America.” This deal rewards those very people with a huge cash injection that can and will be used to promulgate terrorism. The agreement does not require Iran to cease or even diminish its terrorist activities, regional meddling, and human rights abuses. Kerry serves up a word salad about pressuring Iran on these other fronts in the future, and notes that American sanctions won’t be lifted against certain American-murdering criminals within the regime. But other Western sanctions are lifted against those individuals as part of the deal, to which the Obama administration has agreed. Kerry’s distinction is meaningless. The ground Cotton powerfully covers over his seven minutes barely scratches the surface of the Iran deal’s irreparable flaws. The accord is opposed by a majority of Americans. ",

        "articles": "Remember the Halbig case? There’s a part of the ObamaCare statute that says you’re eligible for money from Uncle Sam to pay the premiums on your new health insurance plan provided that you bought your plan on “an exchange established by the State.” The left says that phrase includes the federal exchange; the right says nope, it means only the exchanges established by individual states. The whole point of the subsidies, in theory, was to create a financial incentive for state governments to build their own exchanges so that the feds wouldn’t have to build one. If the Supreme Court, which is set to rule within the next few months, agrees with the right’s interpretation of the text, millions of people who bought their plans on Healthcare.gov, the feds’ exchange, will see their subsidies disappear. They’ll either have to pay their expensive premiums entirely out of their own pockets or they’ll have to drop their plans, which could cause chaos to ObamaCare’s risk pools and even potentially trigger a “death spiral.” There’s lots of money and lots of potential voter anger at stake. But it’s a golden opportunity for ObamaCare opponents: Our best chance to kill the law at this point would be to have SCOTUS take the subsidies away and then have Republicans in Congress and at the state level steadfastly refuse to restore them. Without those subsidies the law is probably unsustainable. But there’s an election to be won, my friends. Which means, whatever happens in court, the subsidies are coming back. For a little while, at least. The legislation, offered by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), one of the most politically vulnerable Senate incumbents in 2016, would maintain the federal HealthCare.gov subsidies at stake in King v. Burwell through the end of August 2017. The bill was unveiled this week with 29 other cosponsors, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and his four top deputies, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), John Thune (R-SD), John Barrasso (R-WY) and Roy Blunt (R-MO). Another cosponsor is Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), the chairman of the conference’s electoral arm… Also notable is the Republicans who are not among the bill’s cosponsors, including three presidential candidates — Sen. Ted Cruz (TX), Sen. Rand Paul (KY) and Sen. Marco Rubio (FL) — as well as other vulnerable senators facing reelection including Sen. Mark Kirk (IL), Kelly Ayotte (NH) and Pat Toomey (PA). Heavy majorities, including a majority of Republicans, want the subsidies restored if the White House loses in Halbig, an ominous sign for the congressional GOP. In theory, voter anger could be so intense that both chambers of Congress will end up back under Democratic control, ensuring that the subsidies will be restored anyway. Now, show of hands: Who thinks the GOP will even considering refusing to renew subsidies in August 2017, when Johnson’s bill would be set to expire? They’ll be 15 months from a key midterm election at that point, one they may be counting on to return control of the Senate to Republicans after Democrats retake a narrow majority in 2016. This is the eternal problem with top GOPers trying to postpone key fights for electoral reasons — there’s always another election to win right around the corner. In fairness to Johnson, his bill does include some other things that would make conservatives happy, like repealing the individual mandate (which could also damage ObamaCare, although not nearly as badly as losing the subsidies would), but that seems more like leverage for the inevitable negotiations with Senate Democrats than something Republicans would insist on. It may be that Democrats will demand permanent reinstatement of the subsidies, the GOP will counter with “no way, and forget about the mandate too,” and then the two sides will compromise by leaving the mandate alone and agreeing to “temporarily” reinstate subsidies every few years, a la “doc fix.” Which, actually, might not be the worst possible outcome: If you want to force the GOP to push its own version of repeal-and-replace health-care reform, the prospect of them having to take a tough vote periodically on giving billions to people who bought into O-Care is one way to concentrate their minds on the problem. In the meantime, though, you’re watching a game of GOP hot potato play out in real time over Halbig. The congressional strategy until now has been to do nothing, hope that SCOTUS deep-sixes the subsidies, and then leave it to Republican governors and state legislatures to make the hard decision about whether to build their own state exchanges so that their residents can be eligible for subsidies again. No way, said Scott Walker last week: Congress created this mess, it should be Congress that’s forced to clean it up by passing something to deal with the subsidies issue. (Another governor who’s eyeing a 2016 run, Bobby Jindal, notably called last month for not reinstating the subsidies if they’re struck down.) So now here’s the Senate GOP leadership trying to help Walker out, led by his fellow Wisconsinite Ron Johnson — a guy who’s not only running for reelection in a blue state but currently trails Russ Feingold in a hypothetical match-up by 16 points. (Coincidentally, Johnson also voted today to confirm Loretta Lynch.) Why congressional Republicans would suddenly feel impelled to move on this and solve this problem for their state colleagues, I’m not sure; presumably McConnell et al. think they’ll be blamed next year for doing nothing even if, as expected, many red states respond by setting up their own exchanges. Or maybe they fear that red-state governors will stand firm and refuse to build the exchanges, putting the ball back in Congress’s court. In other words, McConnell and the rest might be making this move because they know state-level Republicans have more backbone than they do. Via TPM, listen below to a recent exchange on a radio show in which Johnson was asked about restoring the subsidies. If we don’t pass my bill, he says, one of two things will happen. Either Obama will float a one-line bill in Congress asking for permanent restoration of the subsidies or he’ll offer to help red states build their own exchanges quickly by essentially allowing them to take over the state risk pools already built by Healthcare.gov. Is it really that easy, though? Red-state pols might not be willing to make a deal like that with O, preferring to let Congress take the heat for fixing this instead. And not even Senate Republicans would feel comfortable restoring subsidies permanently during an election year. They’ll end up countering with a temporary fix, which is what Johnson’s bill does, in which case why not speed up the process by simply offering Johnson’s bill now? The big X factor here is whether Senate Democrats will agree to temporarily restore subsidies or whether they’ll play hardball and threaten to filibuster any bill that doesn’t make them permanent. That would be risky — they, not the GOP, would be the party guilty of preventing subsidies from flowing again after a SCOTUS decision — but they usually come out smelling like a rose in the media when they play hardball with Republicans. “We’ll accept nothing less than permanent reinstatement of subsidies for all hard-working Americans!” Schumer will say. What will McConnell say to that? ",

Fear not! Turns out that he’s landed himself a gig writing political analysis columns for the Washington Post. (The Hill) John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s former presidential campaign chairman, has joined The Washington Post as a contributing columnist, according to a Thursday announcement by the paper. “No one knows more about how Washington works, how the White House operates, and how policy ideas are translated into reality than John Podesta,” said the Post’s editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt, in a statement. “His long experience in Congress, inside two Democratic White Houses and on the front lines of numerous presidential campaigns, will offer readers vital insight into Washington and politics at the start of a new era.” I’m a little bit lost at the moment. Part of me wants to start pulling my hair out and declaring that this is simply too unbelievable to be a real story. But there’s a nagging feeling at the back of my mind that I should’ve already realized this is simply business as usual. Still, at what point did the train go so badly off the rails that we arrived at this juncture? It’s not a question of whether or not the Washington Post should be ready, willing and able to hire some more distinctly liberal voices as editorial columnists. That’s pretty much a given. They already have a full stable of them on the payroll but there’s always room for more. Yes, I’m sure there are those of us who would like to see them investing their time and money into landing a few more prominent conservative voices just for balance. This is particularly true since their Right Turn blog is still being run by someone so deeply trapped in Trump Derangement Syndrome that many of the columns are indistinguishable from those written by the usual Democratic cheerleaders. But even if they were going to add another left-side voice, I just can’t get over the fact that it turned out to be John Podesta. Seriously? Am I the only one who remembers when a bunch of his emails wound up being leaked to the public? Some of them opened up a whole new chapter in the ongoing discussion over how closely the mainstream media is “embedded” (or should we just say in bed) with political campaigns. Talk about picking winners and losers… Podesta seemed to be a master of it. Having someone make an informed, well written argument in favor of liberal causes is perfectly acceptable for any newspaper. (Though it would be nice if the numbers from the left and right sides were a bit closer to equal.) But John Podesta isn’t even that consistently liberal. He actually caused no end of problems for Hillary Clinton for some of his less charitable writings and positions. He was always more of a political operative than an analyst and has buttered his bread for decades by keeping his star hitched to the Clintons’ wagon. Still, the guy deserves to earn a living like anybody else. And if this is what the Washington Post has decided to do I guess it’s on them. ",

        "articles": "Sen. Pat Toomey is one of the great accomplishments of the Tea Party Movement, and after supporting him in ’04 back when Bush was backing Specter, it does my heart good to see him in our dysfunctional deliberate body. For that same reason, some are very angry at him for his vote on the fiscal cliff deal. But as we go into another debt-ceiling fight, he’s one of our better communicators on this issue. So, it also does my heart good to see him go on “Morning Joe,” up against five people who disagree with him, and direct the conversation, over and over, away from the fig leaf of revenue and back to the real issue of entitlements and $16 trillion in debt. There are some, like Ben Domenech, who think the debt ceiling deal will look much like this one— a short-term get-out-of-jail solution that again doesn’t address our real problems because no one really wants to address them. There are some, like Jim Pethokoukis, who think it’ll end in another tax hike. If it’s ever going to look any different, with the GOP demanding what’s best for the country— “getting us off the path to Greece,” as Toomey puts it by addressing entitlement reform and maybe tax reform—it’s going to take people like Toomey to explain that, on TV, every single day. Many Americans simply don’t understand the gravity of the debt problem. Democrats and some Republicans are more than happy to feed this misunderstanding by pretending these deals make some kind of progress because it helps them avoid stickier budget wickets. Toomey’s Wednesday appearance is getting a lot of press because he said the GOP should be willing to risk a temporary government shut-down to get cuts, but that’s just the beginning of what he said. He challenges the panel on the notion that credit downgrades come from these skirmishes and short-term deals or whether they really come from such deals making clear the U.S. is unwilling to tackle its larger problems. He challenged them on whether a temporary shutdown would cause more pain and disruption than allowing the debt problem to fester until it calls for more drastic measures. He informed them that one of the reasons we’re in these cliff situations is because Democratic senators haven’t passed a budget in three years. All of that should be part of the conversation, but it won’t be unless Republicans like Toomey make it part of the conversation.

        "articles": "Every lawyer who reads Hot Air will start shouting at their screen when they read that headline that you can’t tell how a judge is leaning by what he says at oral argument. Maybe Kennedy’s actually pro-challenger in this case and just wants to iron out one wrinkle in their argument before voting with them! Could be, but don’t forget that the last time O-Care was before the Supreme Court, Kennedy sounded verrrry skeptical of the individual mandate in oral argument, going so far at one point as to ask whether it wouldn’t make more sense to nuke the entire statute rather than try to salvage parts of it if the mandate was held unconstitutional. And in the end, that’s exactly how he voted — the mandate is unconstitutional and the entirety of ObamaCare deserves to be flushed. Kennedy’s oral-argument tea leaves in that case were spot on. Worth noting. As hopefully all grassroots conservatives know by now, the issue in the Halbig case (now known as King v. Burwell) is what the ObamaCare statute means when it says that federal subsidies for premiums are available to anyone who buys their insurance on an exchange “established by the State.” More than 30 states chose not to build their own exchanges so the federal government built an exchange of its own for residents of those states, a.k.a. Healthcare.gov. The question: Are subsidies available for consumers who buy their plans from that federal exchange or are they only available to people who buy from an individual state’s exchange? If it’s the latter, millions of people will suddenly lose their premiums, making their plans unaffordable; as customers drop out, insurers will lose the revenue they need to pay for sick customers’ treatment and the entire ObamaCare scheme could collapse. So which way is Anthony Kennedy, eternal swing voter, leaning? Hmmmmm: On several occasions, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is seen as a swing vote, said that if those challenging the Obama administration get their way, it would raise “a serious constitutional question” about the federal government’s power to coerce states… The plaintiffs in the case, represented by Michael Carvin, have argued that the authors of Obamacare intended to withhold subsidies from those states that didn’t set up their own exchanges as an incentive for them to do so. But that interpretation, Kennedy said, would raise questions relating to the sovereignty of states. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., speaking on behalf of the Obama administration, seized on this point, arguing, “Our reading is the pro-federalism ruling.” That was a smart thing for Verrilli to say, although it may be the first time in six years that the Obama White House has ever pretended to be pro-federalism. There’s a line of landmark Supreme Court precedents in the 1990s, all supported by Kennedy, that holds that federalism is integral to the U.S. Constitution and therefore the federal government can’t force the states to carry out its legislative agenda. States are sovereign, except to the extent the Constitution itself limits that sovereignty. The federal government can’t coerce them to do its bidding. Without having read a transcript, it sounds from various reports this morning like Kennedy’s worried that if he sides with the challengers, he’d be deciding that the feds can coerce the states. If he finds that subsidies are only available to states that build their own exchanges, not to customers who buy insurance on the federal exchange, then he’s blessing a scheme in which the feds are applying heavy fiscal pressure to the states to conform their own health insurance systems to the federal design. It’s coercion! (Kennedy’s phrasing: “Either you create your own exchange, or send your insurance market into a death spiral.”) Whereas if Kennedy sides with the White House interpretation, that the states can do whatever they want and that consumers can just use the federal exchange as a backstop if need be, the coercion problem is solved. See the gigantic irony in that? ObamaCare, the biggest federal intervention in health care since Medicare, may survive legally on federalism grounds because the feds decided to go really big and build their own exchange. Good lord. If Kennedy’s leaning this way he has three options, says SCOTUSblog: Kennedy’s concern is about the federal/state balance and his distrust of a reading that puts a gun to the head of states that fail to set up their own exchanges – threatening them with the almost certain destruction of their statewide insurance systems if they do not comply. That concern might be interpreted (as a matter of legal theory) in a few different ways: Justice Kennedy might believe that Congress would not have intended to set up such a dubious system; he might believe that this reading is required but actually unconstitutional (so that he would strike down the statute’s condition that subsidies apply only to exchanges established by the state); or – perhaps most likely – he might believe that the statute should be interpreted so as to avoid the “serious constitutional problem” he identified. He could simply side with the White House’s reading of “established by a State” and rule that “State” includes “federal government” for purposes of subsidies. Or he could decide that, whatever was meant by “established by a State,” he has no choice but to side with the White House according to the Court’s own rules of interpretation. One of those rules, trumpeted lately by lefties and mentioned today by Kennedy, is “constitutional avoidance,” which says that if a phrase in a statute is unclear and you’re trying to decide how to read it, a judge should read it in a way that doesn’t implicate constitutional principles. (Constitutional rulings have major consequences are are all but impossible for Congress to undo so the Court tries to avoid them whenever possible, at least in theory.) A similar rule also mentioned today by Kennedy during oral arguments is the “Chevron rule,” which says that when a statutory phrase is unclear, a judge should lean towards the interpretation of the federal agency that’s enforcing the statute, in this case the IRS. Here, “constitutional avoidance” and the Chevron rule point the same way, towards the White House’s interpretation of “established by a State.” If you believe, a la Kennedy, that the challengers’ reading of that phrase would violate federalist principles under the Constitution, you should prefer the feds’ reading. If you believe that the IRS’s decision to extend subsidies to customers on the federal exchange deserves some deference, you should also prefer the feds’ reading. The third option open to Kennedy is the trickiest. What if he decides that “established by a State” isn’t unclear, that the plaintiffs are obviously right that “State” means the states only, not the federal government — but that, per the federalism/coercion reasoning of those 1990s cases, that means the statute is … unconstitutional? What happens to the statute then? Is the entire subsidies scheme, not just for federal customers but for state customers, now illegal? That would be an even bigger disaster for the White House than they’re expecting. Or, as SCOTUSblog suggests, would Kennedy decide that because the state subsidy scheme is unconstitutional, the only solution is to remove the element of coercion by letting subsides flow to customers on the federal exchange too, which would be a total win for the White House? If Kennedy goes the latter route, he’d essentially be curing a constitutional defect by rewriting the statute himself to make it conform to the White House’s expectations. How’s that for drama? Just to confuse this a tiny bit more, Kennedy also said this today:  So, who knows. Ain’t looking good early, though. ",

        "articles": "The difference, of course, is that patients usually choose the “Do not resuscitate” order for themselves. In this Washington DC abortion clinic, a doctor advises an undercover reporter for Live Action that the survival of a “fetus” born alive during an abortion depends on “how vigorously you do things to help a fetus survive at this point,” and then goes on to explain that he doesn’t do anything to determine how he would even proceed to determine a course of treatment. The magic of the abortion DNR takes him off the hook: “Hopefully we’ll get this pregnancy out intact, but it doesn’t always happen that way,” Washington, D.C. abortion doctor Cesare Santangelo tells an undercover Live Action investigator who is 24 weeks pregnant. “I try and sever the umbilical cord first, and we wait for that to stop pulsing, and this way the fetus is expired first.” When asked by the undercover investigator what would happen if the baby were to survive the abortion, Doctor Santangelo responds: “Technically – you know, legally we would be obligated to help it, you know, to survive. But, you know, it probably wouldn’t. It’s all in how vigorously you do things to help a fetus survive at this point. Let’s say you went into labor, the membranes ruptured, and you delivered before we got to the termination part of the procedure here, you know? Then we would do things – we would – we would not help it. We wouldn’t intubate. It would be, you know, uh, a person, a terminal person in the hospital, let’s say, that had cancer, you know? You wouldn’t do any extra procedures to help that person survive. Like ‘do not resuscitate’ orders. We would do the same things here.” If you’re wondering how this is any different from Kermit Gosnell’s practice in Philadelphia, well, you’re not the only one. The Washington Post’s Melinda Henneberger wonders where the outrage has been for the abortionists who have either remained silent or offered rhetorical support for such practices: But where’s the coverage of extreme views at the other end of the spectrum? Of, for instance, the jaw-dropping testimony of Planned Parenthood official Alisa LaPolt Snow?When asked by a Florida lawmaker what kind of medical care the organization thinks a child who somehow survives a late-term abortion should get, Snow suggested that even then, the child’s fate is a woman’s right to choose. That’s how our president voted as an Illinois state senator, too, even after his stated concerns about the “born alive” bill were addressed. Though there is a lot of room for disagreement on when life does begin, most of us think viability is a pretty clear, bright line. I’ll pause briefly here to disagree with one assumption here. Scientifically, there is no doubt when individual life begins — it begins at conception, when the human zygote has its own DNA separate from that of the mother or father and begins to experience mitosis. The only controversies on this point are political and philosophical. More from Henneberger: Not Planned Parenthood, though, which hasn’t disavowed anything Snow said. And not the Bronx counselor caught on tape, who warns the woman sitting in front of her that no matter what happens, she mustn’t go to the hospital, where if she were to give birth to a live child, that baby might be given medical care. While in campaign mode, Obama purported to respect diverse views on the abortion issue. But I detected no such sensitivity in his Friday remarks at Planned Parenthood, where he spoke of “those who want to turn back the clock to policies more suited to the 1950s than the 21st century. And they’ve been involved in an orchestrated and historic effort to roll back basic rights when it comes to women’s health.” Abortion, he means, though that word wasn’t in his talk. Of course not, even though abortions are Planned Parenthood’s core business. Obama couldn’t even bring up the name Kermit Gosnell, not even to distinguish what he did in his charnel house in Philadelphia from what Planned Parenthood and its competitors in the abortion industry do across the country. And the reason why is that there really isn’t that much difference — which is why the media wanted to ignore the Gosnell trial for as long as they could. ",

        "articles": "Does pizza make a great motivator to end a pregnancy? The latest video from Live Action features former Planned Parenthood managers discussing the financial pressure put on clinics to maximize the revenue stream from their core business — abortions. The pressure wasn’t just limited to the managers either, but also to the women who came to the clinic: “I trained my staff the way that I was trained, which was to really encourage women to choose abortion; to have it at Planned Parenthood, because it counts towards our goal.” “It sounds kind of crazy, but pizza is a motivator [for getting abortion numbers up].” Most of this sounds like the kind of sales-management tactics one would see from retail entities or real-estate offices. It’s not quite Glengarry Glen Ross, but it doesn’t sound anything like a health-care entity. The focus in health care is on the patient, not the number of units sold. Yet Planned Parenthood insists that its mission is the former, not the latter. One of the two former managers interviewed makes that distinction plain when discussing how Planned Parenthood trains managers to deliver the hard sell to women in crisis: “If they’d say, ‘I’m not able to pay [my bill] today,’ then we would say something like, ‘Well, if you can’t pay $10 today, how are you going to take care of a baby? Have you priced diapers? Do you know how much it costs to buy a car seat? Where would you go for help? There’s no place in Storm Lake (or whatever town they were in), you know, where you can get help as a pregnant mom. So really, don’t you think your smartest choice is termination?’ This points out more clearly what Planned Parenthood actually sells — despair. They want women to panic, to despair, in order to profit off of it. This sales pitch takes a woman at her most vulnerable and heaps the weight of the world on her shoulders … simply to meet a sales goal. At least in Glengarry Glen Ross, no one died. Lila Rose echoes the same point: “Planned Parenthood doesn’t have quotas for adoptions. It doesn’t have quotas for prenatal care. But quotas for abortions? Absolutely,” said Lila Rose, president and founder of Live Action. “Planned Parenthood makes a profit off women in the midst of their most difficult experiences and incentivizes ​its staff to take the lives of chil​dren in the womb with pizza parties, paid time off, ​and lunch​es with upper management.​ It’s time to redirect our tax money toward local health clinics that actually provide real care to women, instead of to Planned Parenthood, a corporation focused on upping ​its abortion numbers.” It’s not health care — it’s business. The federal government shouldn’t subsidize it through Title X tax expenditures, but should direct those funds to health-care providers who focus on the patient, not the revenue stream from abortions. Let Planned Parenthood stand on its own two feet, or not at all. ",

        "articles": "Rasmussen has Trump leading in the four-way race. Suffolk has him down further than Romney’s margin of defeat against Obama. What’s a poll consumer to do? It’s not just Ras and Suffolk either. Check out the spread in the last 10 surveys that are being tracked by RCP: Suffolk, Monmouth, and Quinnipiac all have Clinton up by seven. Fox News, Reuters, and Gravis have her ahead by just one or two points, and Rasmussen, as noted, has Trump up narrowly. This is why aggregators like RCP track poll averages: Presumably the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and indeed, three more pollsters have the race in the four- to five-point range. Note, though, that the by now familiar floor/ceiling dynamic for Trump and Clinton holds true in all of these polls except Rasmussen. Trump occasionally nudges above 40 percent but he’s been mired for awhile in the 37-39 percent range. Clinton occasionally falls below 41 percent but that’s pretty reliably her floor. Trump needs three points from somewhere. Ed gave you the key findings from Rasmussen. Suffolk’s: In a four-way scenario that includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein, Clinton maintained a 7-point advantage, 42 percent to Trump’s 35 percent; Johnson was at 9 percent; Stein, 4 percent; with 10 percent undecided… Clinton led Trump 54 percent to 38 percent among women, 92 percent to 4 percent among African-American voters and 65 percent to 24 percent among Hispanic voters… Both candidates have high unfavorable ratings, with Trump at 59 percent and Clinton at 51 percent unfavorable. Nearly one in five voters say they dislike both candidates. Among those who dislike both, Trump led 32 percent to Clinton’s 28 percent, with 32 percent undecided and 8 percent refusing a response. In the four-way ballot test among “the haters” Johnson tops the field with 34 percent, followed by Trump (21 percent), Clinton (15 percent), and Stein (8 percent), while 20 percent were undecided. Interesting that Clinton leads comfortably overall even though Trump leads her among people who dislike both of them. That’s probably an artifact of greater divisions on the right than the left over each side’s nominee. Anti-Trump Republicans are more likely to hold their noses and vote for him, I’d guess, than to cross the aisle and vote for the liberal. If that’s true, and if in fact there are more of them in the “dislike both” group than there are anti-Clinton Democrats — which is what you’d expect given the antagonism on the right over Trump — then yeah, Trump will lead within that group overall. And speaking of anti-Trump Republicans, here’s an interesting result: Fifty percent of voters are at least somewhat likely to split their tickets. Given that Hillary’s leading overall right now, that’s good news for Republican senators like Pat Toomey who are in trouble. If you’re wondering, by the way, why Suffolk is seeing a big Clinton lead while Fox News is seeing a small one, the key differences lie with men, whites, and independents (categories which overlap considerably, of course). Fox has Trump leading handily in all three groups, 13 points among men, 13 among whites, and 12 among indies. Suffolk has Trump leading among men by a single point(!), by eight among whites, and trailing by four among independents. (Romney won whites by 20 in 2012, so Trump’s badly underperforming him in both polls.) Curiously, though, Suffolk has Trump performing better with Republicans (78 percent) than the more favorable Fox News poll does (74 percent). If Trump were pulling as many members of his own party as Hillary is pulling among hers (81 percent), he’d probably be leading outright in the four-way race there. That’s a nice reminder, though, that while Clinton’s margin is much narrower in the Fox News poll than in other national surveys right now, it’s hard to call it a “good poll” for Trump. The guy’s at 39 percent in the four-way race. It’s “good” only in the sense that Hillary is performing at what appears to be her floor. In fact, if you move from the four-way race to the two-way race, Fox has Clinton ahead by six points, greater than Obama’s margin over Romney four years ago. Trump is close only because Gary Johnson is momentarily peeling off enough voters from Clinton to keep it close. If those voters abandon him, you’d expect most of them to come back to the Democrat than go Republican. One more poll worth your time, this time at the state level: Franklin & Marshall has a new one out of Pennsylvania that puts Clinton up five in the four-way race, in between the eight-point lead Monmouth saw a few days ago and the three-point lead that Emerson found the day before that. Same old story: Trump is stuck at 40 percent, exactly the number he pulled in Monmouth and in line with his overall average of 39.6. (Emerson had Trump at 43, for what it’s worth.) This graph is the story of the campaign to date: Trump’s crushing it among white men without a college degree, but that’s the only group where he’s crushing it. Romney won white men overall in Pennsylvania by 21 points in 2012; Trump is barely topping that margin among less educated white men and is actually trailing Clinton among college-educated white men. Romney won white women overall by nine points in Pennsylvania, but Trump trails within that group among both educational levels. He can’t win being this much of a niche candidate. That’s what the “softening” per his outreach to minorities has been about. A “softer” Trump can only improve his current numbers in demographics that are chilly to him. Speaking of which, in lieu of an exit question, I’ll leave you with this. Suffolk national poll, black voters:Clinton 87%Johnson 4%Stein 4%Trump  — Steve Koczela (@skoczela) September 1, 2016 ",

        "articles": "Got a verrrry interesting e-mail from a GOP insider this morning in response to last night’s post about the coming convention clusterfark. Sean Trende, looking at the electoral landscape, thinks a brokered convention is likely. My source, looking at the changes to the GOP rulebook in 2012, think it’s highly likely. Quote: At the 2012 convention, the rules were changed (at the behest of Romney supporters) so that in order for a candidate’s name to officially be placed in nomination, he must have a MAJORITY of the delegates from EIGHT states. The old rule (at least since the ‘70s I think) was a PLURALITY of delegates from FIVE states. Big, big difference. The Romney folks pushed it as a way to keep Ron Paul from being able to get his name in the hat in ’16, assuming Romney won the White House. Bottom line, with sooooo many good candidates in the race, and considering the other factors you mention, and the fact that the primary timeline/rules have changed so as to mandate that a state has to award delegates proportionally prior to March 15, the odds that anyone gets a majority of eight go down…and the incentive not to drop out is even more pronounced. A candidate figures the longer they stay in and cut the pie up into smaller chunks, the greater the chance they can prevent any one guy from getting a majority of eight. Then you’ve got your brokered convention – and they might have a shot. Other sub-plot to pay attention to in this scenario is the “territories”, (Guam, Northern Marianas, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Virgin Islands, DC)…they ALL get treated like “states” under RNC rules…meaning they could count towards the “majority of eight”…meaning be on the lookout for candidates raining down dollars and keg parties for 5 or 6 delegates out of Guam, etc… Pretty soon the candidates will catch on to this rule change and make that kind of “investment”. At this point most RNC members themselves, much less candidates/staffers are aware of all this. Great time to be a delegate. Read the rule for yourself. It’s 40(b). Dave Catanese saw all of this coming in a prescient story for U.S. News & World Report nearly a year ago wondering whether the change to Rule 40(b) — which, ironically, was supposed to help shorten the nomination process — would actually lengthen it considerably and force the party into a brokered convention. Like my source, Catanese also saw Romney’s fingerprints on the rule change: It was apparently Mitt’s lawyer, Ben Ginsberg, who pushed it through in 2012 so that President Romney would have less to fear from a Ron or Rand Paul primary challenge in 2016 when he ran for reelection. Under the new rule, Paul would somehow have to take 51 percent from the sitting president in no fewer than eight states to qualify for the nomination at the convention. Fast-forward three years: Romney’s now retired and the nascent GOP field looks to be the strongest and most evenly matched in modern history, raising the possibility that no one will win a majority of delegates in any state until the winner-take-all states start voting in mid-March. So imagine this. Imagine, per Trende’s scenario, that Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul all break from the pack early on, supported by small but devout mini-factions within the party. Bush is the centrist, Walker the center-right fusion candidate, Cruz the tea partier, Paul the libertarian. They each settle at around 20 percent, with the remaining 20 percent divided among second-tier candidates. Someone wins Iowa, someone else wins New Hampshire, a third guy wins South Carolina and so forth. None of them, however, wins 51 percent (or even comes close to 51 percent) in these proportional-delegate states, meaning that none of them is any closer to satisfying Rule 40(b). That’s a strong incentive for each man to stay in the race and keep running: While the early states will be great for building electoral momentum, it’s the later states that award all of their delegates to the winner that will be truly valuable to each candidate in meeting Rule 40(b). Here’s the list of states that are currently scheduled to hold their primaries after March 15: Arizona, Maryland, Washington DC, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Indiana, Nebraska, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oregon, Arkansas, California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah That’s all subject to change. How they award their delegates is also subject to change, as far as I know. If each state decides that they’d prefer to award their delegates proportionally, they could do that; unlike the pre-March 15 states, though, they have the option of choosing winner-take-all. But let’s face it: Thanks to Rule 40(b) and the prospect of a closely divided field, they all have a strong incentive to prefer winner-take-all to proportional allocation. Imagine it’s early May and there are still three or four candidates battling for the nomination. Imagine if, at that point, it’s still the case that no one has won a majority of delegates in the eight states required by the rule. A state like Montana that’s normally overlooked in the primary process could, by awarding all of its delegates to the winner, become the crucial eighth state needed by one of the candidates to formally qualify for the nomination. And if Montana has an incentive to go that route, so does every other late state. The candidates will be desperate for majority victories; a winner-take-all allocation is the only way to ensure that when there are multiple candidates running. Another interesting thing about the 20 states named above is how many of them are homes to some of the leading contenders this year. Wisconsin gave us Walker; New Jersey gave us Christie; Arkansas gave us Huckabee; Kentucky gave us Paul. If any or all of those guys are still in it at that point, their home states could be key to getting them to the eight-state threshold. Other states may be sympathetic to one candidate over the other because of regional biases. Walker, the midwesterner, should play well in Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Montana. Christie and maybe Jeb Bush will play well in northeastern or seaboard states like Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, Maryland, and DC. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Huckabee would have an advantage in southern or rural states like Arkansas, Kentucky, and West Virginia. It’d be indescribably suspenseful watching each of the final few candidates in the race pile up late wins, wondering if one or even all of them will eventually get to eight to meet the Rule 40(b) or fall short. Which raises another possibility. What if no man wins a clear majority of total delegates and only one man wins a majority of delegates in eight states? I.e., let’s say Scott Walker has the most delegates after all the primaries are over — say, 45 percent of all delegates nationwide — but has only won a clear majority in seven states. And let’s also say that Jeb Bush has won just 35 percent of delegates nationally but, thanks to his strength in the northeast and on the west coast, has won majorities in eight states. Doesn’t that mean Jeb is the nominee since he’s the only man left standing who qualifies for the nomination under Rule 40(b)? That outcome is … not going to go over well with Walker fans. Or, just for extra funsies, imagine that the 20 winner-take-all states are split roughly evenly among a strong and stubborn field of four final candidates, ensuring that no man satisfies Rule 40(b). Catanese wondered about that too. Can you say “floor fight”? A delegate driven process would force candidates to devote significant time to a smaller group of party elites around the entire country rather than spending a disproportionate amount of time in a handful of early key states that receive the bulk of the media attention. If that sounds undemocratic, Haugland flips the argument and argues that the real modern day party bosses are the high-charging consultants and large dollar donors who power campaigns through an avalanche of television ads. Having to chase delegates on a convention floor would suck the money out of the process and replace it with a market of ideas, placing poorly funded candidates on equal footing with the well-financed titans. Yes, Haugland’s self-aware enough to realize how quaint and unrealistic this sounds to naysayers in today’s era. …Yeah, I suppose. But more likely it would be a free-for-all in which the final candidates each try to outdo each other in terms of special favors promised to various state delegations. It’d be a cronyist nightmare — and pure-spun traffic gold. Can’t wait. ",

        "articles": "Did they erupt in joy for the children who now have a real opportunity to choose success over failure? Er, not exactly: Republicans dropped a legislative bombshell tonight as they slammed through a dramatically revamped education bill that will give tax credits for families at “failing schools” to send their children to private school or another public school. Lawmakers voted mid-day to send a school flexibility bill — that would let school systems seek waivers from some policies — to conference committee. The conference committee reported a dramatically different bill that included the flexibility measures plus what some lawmakers called school vouchers. Republicans heralded it as a historic day for education and life-altering for children stuck in poorly performing schools. But tempers boiled over as Democrats called the maneuver “sleaziness” and a “bait and switch.” Governor Robert Bentley insisted that this represented a step forward for children whose choices had been restricted to just the failing schools in the government education monopoly prior to the passage of the bill, which Bentley will sign next week: The reaction on the state senate floor can be heard here, although it’s not easy to follow except to note the anger over the change in the bill. “We’re going to help children in this state!” says one of the bill’s backers, over the repeated chant of “Point of order!” from one of its opponents. Democrats in the legislature accused Republicans of “sleaziness” in pushing the school choice option for students in failing schools: The move drew outrage from Democrats who said the plan was evidently in the works for some time. “I’ve never seen such sleaziness,” Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, said. And consider the race card tossed: Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, as she was leaving the House chamber threw her hands over her head and shouted, “Welcome to the new confederacy where a bunch of white men are now going to take over black schools.” Well, if the “black schools” are where students are failing, wouldn’t that set the black students free of that failure? Isn’t that supposed to be a good thing? Why wouldn’t we want to give those students the same chance at success as other children in the state, rather than leave them locked into failing state-run institutions? Our tipster on this story noted that the teachers union managed to block a more limited school-choice bill last year in Alabama, which is probably why the state GOP held their cards closer to the vest this time. If Alabama voters agree that this was a sleazy maneuver, and the argument can certainly be made, then Republicans will suffer the consequences in the next election. If, however, the parents of those children locked into failing schools value the educational possibilities for their children over the needs of the teachers union and the Democrats, the state GOP will reap a harvest of new voters. I suspect that the latter will be much more true than the former. ",

        "articles": "I wonder if any of the Democrats who previously insisted that the crisis at the southern border was a fantasy fabricated by Donald Trump but now think it’s the Worst Thing Ever will be interested in this news? Despite the best efforts of Nancy Pelosi and congressional Democrats to stop it, construction of the border wall continues. I wasn’t even aware of the last bits of new construction until I heard about it from Brian Cates on Twitter.  Sure enough, it was a press release from the Border Patrol. As it turns out, several new bits of barrier construction in some of our more porous areas were wrapping up this month with more to come in the future. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has completed construction of approximately 50 miles of new bollard wall projects authorized by funding from fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Since January 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have received funding to support construction of up to approximately 201-205 miles of new border barriers through a combination of appropriations and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF). This funding is supporting the top border barrier priorities for the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP). Once again, the Democrats can stomp their feet until they turn blue in the face and threaten lawsuits to stop it, but this is funding that was already appropriated for this specific purpose. The first pot of money consists of $341 million appropriated in 2017 for roughly 40 miles of new Bollard Wall and gates for high priority areas in the San Diego, El Centro, El Paso and Rio Grande Valley regions. CBPP reports that this work is 99% finished. After that, they will be working on another 80 miles of new border wall that was funded in 2018. Approximately ten miles of that project are complete. You’ll notice that you’re not hearing much about this on most of the cable news networks. Obviously, it’s not something most of the talking heads want to chat about because it comes off looking like a win for the President. (And we can’t have that, can we?) But now that the Democrats are on board with the idea that there’s a crisis at the border, they should be happy about this, right? Fewer families in cages and all that. Let’s hope so. Why don’t we close with some nice visuals? Here’s a low-level aerial view of one of the new sections of bollard wall in California. It’s less than a minute long. Enjoy. ",
