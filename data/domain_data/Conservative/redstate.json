        "articles": "On top of dealing with Common Core, drugs and sex in schools, and students (and parents) who want to cause them bodily harm, public school coaches in Moore County, North Carolina, have one more thing to worry about this week – Christians working in their schools! GASP! The horror! The secular progressive educrats who work in the Moore County Public Schools are asking – nay, demanding – that all of their coaches answer a six-page survey titled “Staff Prayer Questionnaire.” This overbearing questionnaire has dozens of questions in each section, including “Have you ever participated in or seen any prayers at any MCS [Moore County Schools] athletic practices games or events?”, “Which students participated in the prayer? (Be as specific as possible.)”, “Which employees participated in the prayer? (Be as specific as possible.)”, “Was it a Christian prayer?”, “Did students say ‘amen’?”, and “What was the content of the prayer? – i.e., what exactly was said?” Yes, the Moore County Schools is going full Lois Lerner on its coaches, conducting a witch hunt by asking coaches to rat out fellow coaches who might be Christians. But don’t worry – the “Staff Prayer Questionnaire” also asks coaches if anyone participated in a Jewish prayer, invoked the name of Allah, bowed to Mecca, meditated on the sayings of Confucius, etc. NO! JUST KIDDING! HA HA! The educrats would NEVER ask such questions. The survey was clearly Christian-based (biased?), as you can see here. I understand that each coach’s written answers to this “survey” must be turned in this week. I hope these coaches stay strong in the face of secular progressivism. I also hope they lawyer up. It’s time to stand up and speak out, whatever the cost. ",

You have a city council that might as well wear black ski masks and carry Molotov cocktails. You have a police force that is walking on eggshells because it knows it will be scapegoated by the political establishment if they resist. This is the police department that meekly surrendered one of its precincts to the fascists who created the dystopic hell hole that was CHAZ. You have a surfeit of privileged, dumpy, whitebread fascists now that the coffee shops are closed and they can draw enhanced unemployment payments while hanging out in Mom’s basement in the Che Guevara t-shirt and plotting the revolution. The real question in Seattle and in Portland is how long are the average citizens going to put up with this clown show coming into their neighborhoods and upsetting their lives. If this awesome video from Seattle is any indicator, the answer is “not very much longer.” Update: here’s a video of the Every Day March bike brigader being attacked last night in the northgate area. He seems to be a garbage man. Feel free to share the video to help identify the racist yelling we “we out of his neighborhood”.

What was sort of disorienting in reading the comments was the number of people calling for this guy to be arrested knowing that they are the same douches who want to defund the police. In my opinion, both authorities and citizens have acted with remarkable restraint when dealing with these would-be insurrectionists. Eventually, patience is going to run out and they are going to find out what it is to be treated like the vermin they are.

        "articles": "========= ========= Promoted from the diaries by streiff. Promotion does not imply endorsement. ========= ========= I saw lots of angst in the comments boards yesterday. Perhaps these observations will help us all focus on the objectively good situation we are in on the Kavanaugh nomination, and recognize (and accept) some realities of that situation. We’re lucky to even be here. Two years ago, in late September of 2016, the smart money was betting on a Democrat Senate. With Dianne Feinstein as its chair, controlling the schedule and whose nominations get considered. So, things could have been a lot, lot worse. We have to play the cards we have, not the ones we wish to have. One of the first things the Army taught me was this: when you start to plan an operation, identify the constraints you face. Are you short of ammo, are your cannon crews undermanned, is the weather going to be bad, etc..? Then, you come up with the best plan you can, that takes those constraints into account. Without exception, the plan you come up with is not the plan you’d prefer to execute—it’s the plan you CAN execute. But, whatever you do, you never pretend the constraints don’t exist. In this Senate, we have 51 GOP Senators. Two of them are pro-choice (Collins, Murkowski) and another one is Jeff Flake, who we now know can be easily intimidated. Without them, we have no majority. They know that, the Democrats know that, and the GOP leadership knows that. We have to have at least one or two of them vote for Kavanaugh. We cannot send other people to Washington to vote in their place. Only 101 people on the face of the Earth (I’m counting VP Pence here) will get to vote on Kavanaugh. We have to deal with those 101 people, not other people that we wish are in the Senate. We have to execute a plan that will get Kavanaugh confirmed by a majority of these 101 people. We have limited leverage on those three Senators. Flake is leaving office. Collins and Murkowski just won re-election. And, it’s possible this is their last stint in the Senate. Threatening retaliation at the ballot box may not work with these three. Collins and Murkowski know that every vote in the Senate is precious. They know that they can screw the GOP on the Kavanaugh nomination and still hold lots of power in the Senate. Even if Leader McConnell punishes them by taking away any committee chairmanships they have. They know this. We hold the high ground on this nomination. Brett Kavanaugh is an appealing SCOTUS candidate to everyone except hardcore Democrats and SJWs. He’s being pilloried under a unfair standard that, if applied to everyone in this country, would disqualify most people from public service. Most Americans intuitively know that. Most Americans recognize unfairness when they see it. Did the Democrats really beat up Kavanaugh in the Judiciary Committee hearing? If he had obvious weaknesses, in his character or record, they would have torn into him. Did they tear into him? No. Because they knew they couldn’t. This is a decent, high-quality guy. And, decent people recoil when they see other decent people being trashed. The Democrats are hoping that we quit, and pull the nomination. They are also hoping that we conservatives and Republicans turn on each other, less that two months before an election. We need to keep our wits about ourselves, and make the Democrats do the heavy lifting and convince the American people that Brett Kavanaugh doesn’t deserve to be on the Supreme Court. I doubt they can do that. We can afford to wait another week or two, if need be. Everything I’ve read says that Kavanaugh can begin hearing cases immediately after he’s sworn it. He’s not going to miss an entire year of SCOTUS cases. He might miss a few weeks, even a month, but that’s a setback we can absorb. Remember the end payoff: a good SCOTUS justice for the next 20 years. And, the vast majority of early voters won’t vote until mid-October. By then, this all should be resolved. (I fully expect that McConnell will have it resolved by then, because he has the authority to do it). I don’t think Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski want to be in the minority in the Senate. If their antics lead to many GOP voters sitting on their hands in November, those two ladies might find themselves in the minority. I think they want to be committee chairs. I’m sure they know that it’s a lot more fun to be in charge in the Senate, than simply be in the Senate. We are facing an experienced, capable opponent. The Democrats are not stupid. They know how to play the Beltway political and media game. Going back to my Army days, I was taught to expect setbacks, even defeats, in any operation I planned. Your opponent (NOT enemy) is going to try and beat you. Unless they are total pushovers, they will succeed from time to time. And the Senate Democrats are not pushovers. You absorb your defeats, learn from them, and then press on to your objective! They set us back. OK; now we deal with it and move on. If our spirit and will breaks, we WILL lose. That would be a shame, because we are in a really good position on this nomination. We have a great nominee and our opponents have a weak case to sell. As the days go by, it gets weaker. We now have a powerful campaign issue to take to voters: “Do you really want THESE people in charge?” Now that the nomination is in the hands of Mitch McConnell, it can stay here. He controls the process now. And, we can now employ some of our better spokespeople. Tom Cotton and Joni Ernst come to mind. These three wobbly Senators are not unreachable. I don’t think much of Jeff Flake right now, but I doubt he wants to go down in American history as the embodiment of G.K. Chesterton’s Men Without Chests. And I doubt that Collins and Murkowski want to establish a precedent that makes mothers worry that their sons can be targeted at any time in their life, for their missteps in their callow and careless teenage years. Now, folks, is not the time to go wobbly. ",

        "articles": "Generally we don’t have a lot to say here about the Super Bowl itself, and today won’t be any different. If you want a great wrap up of the game itself, you’ll sadly have to go somewhere else. I didn’t have a rooting interest at all in this Super Bowl, so I was mainly watching for the spectacle. However, many people watched for a completely different reason. There was a whole group of alleged feminists who fired up their computers and got excited about the Super Bowl because they were really looking forward to… tweeting about which commercials offended them. They came up with a hashtag, #notbuyingit, which told these naughty companies that they weren’t going to be buying their products due to their “offensive” ads. Right off the bat, the taking offense brigade got offended at what might have been the first in-game comercial, the Snickers ad with Willem Dafoe. I don’t think it was a particularly great ad, but there’s no accounting for taste: In addition to not being especially funny, however, this ad was apparently “transphobic.” .@SNICKERS, what was up w that commercial? Transphobic & implies women OK w being objectified as long as they have snacks #NotBuyingIt #SB50 — NARAL (@NARAL) February 7, 2016 Hey, @Hyundai – taking away your daughter’s autonomy and stalking her on a date isn’t funny. #NotBuyingIt #SB50 — NARAL (@NARAL) February 7, 2016 What’s extra creepy about the Hyundai ad is that the daughter seemed to actually want to kiss the guy, but Daddy said no… #NotBuyingIt — Elizabeth (@MissCherryPi) February 7, 2016 Now, you might be wondering what could possibly be wrong with this ad, but don’t worry, NARAL is here to tell you: #NotBuyingIt – that @Doritos ad using #antichoice tactic of humanizing fetuses & sexist tropes of dads as clueless & moms as uptight. #SB50 — NARAL (@NARAL) February 8, 2016 NARAL hates unborn babies so much that they don’t want one being shown on ultrasound even when the couple in question wants to keep their own baby. More to the point, we didn’t used to have this cottage industry of people who participated in a given event (watching the Super Bowl, in this case) for the sole purpose of being offended. But now, we’re a sick society that is less concerned with putting our nose to the grindstone and creating our own success than we are in complaining about how unfair life has been to us. We won’t be the greatest nation in the world much longer if we keep going like this. ",

        "articles": "It’s hard to overstate how many different ways we have evidence staring us in the face that Marco Rubio is a strong general election candidate and Donald Trump a disastrous one, but here’s another. The Washington Post and Univision have a joint poll out this morning of 1,200 Hispanic registered voters nationwide, 52% of them American-born and 24% Mexican-born. For the optimist, the good news is that Hispanic voters – by far and away the nation’s fastest-growing voter segment even if the borders were sealed tomorrow and no new citizenships granted – are open-minded enough to separate Trump from the rest of the GOP and to have more favorable opinions of other Republicans. For the pessimist, if Trump becomes the nominee, we will have handed the Democrats the single electoral weapon they desire above all others: a long-term cementing of Hispanic voters to their party in numbers approaching that of black voters. Combined with Trump driving out of the party its pro-lifers, small-government and Constitutional conservatives, libertarians, supply-siders, neoconservatives, and free traders, what’s left would be a very small and angry tent. The Horse Race But let’s have the good news first! Hispanic voters aren’t satisfied with the direction of the country, 54-33 (-22), a sign of dissatisfaction that could be exploited in this campaign if the GOP nominates a Republican; that’s 43-46 (-3) even among Hispanic Democrats. Hispanics as a whole will break for the Democrats – 51% lean that way right now compared to 14% leaning Republican (-27), but almost a third (32%) are undecided, a bloc that could make a very big difference, especially since these are registered voters and shifts in enthusiasm could affect turnout. “Voting for a candidate willing to continue Obama’s policies” polls at just 34-30 (+4). Who can capitalize on this? Rubio. He polls at 44-37 (+8) favorable, with 16-21% (-5) strongly favorable vs strongly unfavorable (a useful metric mostly because these are the folks who are beyond persuasion). Cruz is underwater, 39-44 (-5), and 12-29 (-17) with the “very” fav/unfav. 18% are still undecided on Rubio, 17% on Cruz. By contrast, Carson was not deemed worth polling, and while Kasich polled decently at 27-21 (+6) and 9-10 (-1) with the very fav/unfav, a majority (52%) have no opinion about him, fittingly for a guy at 8.3% of the vote so far with no resources and not competing in most of the next 18 states. But Trump? Hold on to your hat: Trump’s favorables with Hispanics are 16-80 (-64), and his very favorable/very unfavorable is 8-72 (-64). In other words, almost 3/4 of Hispanics have already formed a strongly negative view of Trump. Only 3% are undecided. Hispanics are not the only voting bloc that would see a Trump nomination as a gigantic middle finger aimed at them, but they’re probably atop the list. Against Hillary, Rubio runs best, or rather least-worst, 31-61 (-30) with 8% undecided; Cruz runs 27-65 (-38), also with 8% undecided; Kasich runs 23-66 (-43) with 10% undecided. Trump predictably gets annihilated 16-73 (-57), although the 10% undecided figure does speak to Hillary’s vulnerability – nearly everybody who doesn’t hate Trump is persuadable. Unfortunately for Trump, as is true of the general electorate, a solid majority already hates Trump. Against Sanders, Rubio is also most competitive, in fact even moreso than against Hillary, 33-57 (-24) with 10% undecided; Cruz runs 28-61 (-33), with 12% undecided; Kasich runs 22-59 (-37) with a full 19% undecided. Trump again gets slaughtered 16-72 (-56), with 12% undecided. Hillary and Bernie both have strong favorables among Hispanics, 67-30 (+37) for Hillary and 60-23 (+37) for Bernie, with a lot more undecideds regarding Sanders. So take notice: only Rubio runs better against Hillary than her own approval rating would suggest, while any of the others would add votes against the GOP. Against Sanders, Rubio runs well ahead of that bar, although Cruz is also ahead and Kasich even; Trump is still far behind, making enemies hand over fist. What about the primary? Among Hispanic Republicans (who made up only 240 of the 1200 respondents, so take that for what it’s worth), Rubio leads by 12, 34-22-22 with Trump and Cruz tied for second; 15% are undecided, with 4% preferring Ben Carson, and John Kasich dead last at 3%. Combine first and second choices, and Rubio walks off with it, 53% to 38 for Cruz, 28 for Trump, 11 for Kasich and 8 for Carson. Trump does have some Hispanic fans within this party, they’re just a tiny, outnumbered minority in their demographic at large. Having Issues Hispanics as a group remain liberal-leaning, but by no means monolithically so except on immigration. The poll found – all else being equal – a 54-35 preference for keeping Obamacare, 71-21 for a $15 minimum wage (which also polls unfortunately well among white voters, especially Trump supporters), and 82-11 for a path to citizenship. But only 17% named immigration as their top voting issue, compared to 33% who said jobs or the economy. Trump is Trump Trump’s unpopularity with Hispanics is broad, deep, and decided. By 74-23 (+51), poll respondents found his views of immigration “offensive to you,” with only 2% undecided. 91% said they had heard some or a lot about Trump’s views of Mexican immigrants; 73% said “a lot.” But at the same time, 64% attributed those views to Trump rather than the party as a whole (19% blamed the GOP, and another 10% said “both Trump and other Republicans). 7% were not sure. In other words, these may be voters who on balance are not with us, but most are not yet personally offended and alienated from the Republican Party. Nominate Trump, and that separation disappears, and the bridge burns. And Hillary cackles, and cackles, and cackles all the way to the bank. ",

        "articles": "You can’t spend as much time in large organizations as I have an not be a connoisseur of and fascinated with how the friction between toxic personalities can bring even the most dynamic organization to its knees. We’ve been chronicling for a while the lovely, bloody, internecine conflict going on within the Trump campaign as the girl-bruising he-man, the vicious niblet Corey Lewandowski has been locked in hand-to-gland combat with alleged Russian mob fixer and accused fraudster, Paul Manafort, for the possession of Donald Trump’s withered, malodorous soul. Where Lewandowki had been happy to let the Trump campaign be a hotbed of violence, racism, and general thuggery, Manafort wanted something different. He didn’t object to any of that but he thought the campaign should take a shower, brush its teeth, put on a suit and try to appear civilized. In fact, Manafort assured GOP heavyweights that Trump was just putting on an act. That he didn’t believe any of that crazy stuff and would shortly, very shortly, begin to appear more presidential. Trump disappeared from the Sunday shows. He was replaced by a somnambulent Manafort who couldn’t even bother to be entertaining or to tell a plausible lie. Manafort brought in a collection of virtually unemployable losers, but all fixtures of GOP politics (funny how often the Venn Diagram of those two sets overlap), to replace long time staffers. Well, now the Trump campaign’s imitation of Game of Thrones has taken a new twist: Donald Trump is bristling at efforts to implement a more conventional presidential campaign strategy, and has expressed misgivings about the political guru behind them, Paul Manafort, for overstepping his bounds, multiple sources close to the campaign tell POLITICO. Trump became upset late last week when he learned from media reports that Manafort privately told Republican leaders that the billionaire reality TV star was “projecting an image” for voters and would begin toning down his rhetoric, according to the sources. They said that Trump also expressed concern about Manafort bringing several former lobbying colleagues into the campaign, as first reported by POLITICO. … “I think it pisses him off that he was getting free television by going on the shows and now Paul Manafort is out there resurrecting his career,” said one campaign operative. Citing Manafort’s advocacy within the campaign for an expensive advertising push in upcoming states, the operative said Trump is “saying I can get on every show I want for free and you’re telling me not to do that and that I should pay for my advertising? That doesn’t pass the smell test to me.” Why do we think Manafort, and guys like Rick Wiley (who burned Scott Walker’s campaign to the ground as part of a $26 million bonfire), want to spend money on paid advertising? Because 999 times out of a thousand they will funnel the media production and buying through companies they have an interest in and rake off part of the money to their own benefit. In leaked audio from a presentation to the Republican National Committee, Manafort suggested that Trump’s bombastic campaign trail rhetoric was just “projecting an image” to win over voters. “The image is going to change,” Manafort said on the recording. Around the same time, POLITICO revealed that Manafort brought in a handful of operatives who had ties to his lobbying firm, which had developed a niche representing a roster of controversial international clients who have been collectively described as “the torturers’ lobby.” In particular, multiple sources said Trump was bothered by news stories about Manafort’s representation of Saudi Arabia and for a group accused of being a front for Pakistani intelligence. “I don’t think he was aware of the extent of the work that Paul has done in foreign countries that have not always been friendly to the United States,” said a Washington operative with close relationships to the campaign. How can you hire a senior person and not know that he has represented torturers, lobbied for a Pakistani intelligence front, and is enmeshed up to the roots of his dyed hair in the Russian mob (allegedly)? It isn’t like this stuff was secret. Multiple sources said that Trump in recent days has re-empowered Lewandowski to handle the campaign’s finances and make some hiring decisions, partially reversing changes Manafort laid out this month when seizing some decision-making authority from Lewandowski. Lewandowski was responsible for the campaign’s recent hiring of former Chris Christie campaign manager Ken McKay, who is working on delegate operations but is seen as an ally of Lewandowski’s, according to campaign sources. And at his campaign appearances in the days since Manafort’s appearance at the RNC, Trump has served notice that he isn’t about to change his approach. “If I acted presidential, I can guarantee you this morning, I wouldn’t be here,” Trump said Saturday in Waterbury, Connecticut. Trump is not capable of acting in a way a sentient person would describe as “presidential.” He is a misogynist and could be described as having pedophilic or ephebophilic or incestuous tendencies: He is ruthless and immoral. He has no scruples about defrauding business associates and customer, like, for instance, Trump University students. But what distinguishes Trump from a Borgia Pope is that he is crude and boorish and his high priced education has had no apparent effect. He has no intellectual curiosity and no apparent ability to master even the most mundane ideas. He is so grotesque that he has made Hillary Clinton seem like an inspired choice for president. In short, he is a powerful buffoon. And such a man should never be allowed to hold any position that requires impulse control and planning.

Issue #1, ‘New Party: Who Dis?’” (here) That’s right — a woman elected to Congress was best summed up with the quote “Who Dis?” Well, the answer to “Who Dis” turned out…to be dis: “Dis is DC Comics. We’re suing you.” Devil’s Due is in hot water for portraying AOC as the real Wonder-Woman in one of its cover variations. That’s quite the lawsuit magnet. In the “Alexandria Ocaio-Cortez & The Freedom Force” book, the twenty-something who appears to literally understand nothing at all (here and here) hits D.C. like a super hip Lone Ranger, fixing government and fighting against supervillains like Donald Trump and the NRA. She’s a veritable wonder. And a woman. A…wonder…woman. Comicbook.com reports on the suit: The cover in question was the NY Collector Cave retailer exclusive cover by artist Carla Cohen, which…does bear a strong resemblance to DC’s Wonder Woman. Ocasio-Cortez has an A symbol where the typical W would go, but it’s not hard to make the leap to Diana of Themyscira. Despite Alexandria being a socialist hero, capitalism is upping the value of the comic: The print run was already going to be small at 250 copies, but once DC sent their cease-and-desist notice that will now even be smaller, as DC requested the covers not be distributed, but recalled, returned, or destroyed. The cover, however, had already been printed, so while 250 won’t be available, there will be some to get your hands on if you want them, but do expect the price to jump. The cover was originally sold for $30 by NY Collector Cave and then jumped to $40 from several sellers on eBay. It jumped again to $70 on eBay, and you can bet it will make another jump over the next week or so. Be sure and get your hands on one. And check out the drawing of AOC here.

        "articles": "Well, this is weird. Remember Sinead O’Connor? She’s the chick who went on SNL in 1992, performed a song, then tore up a picture of the Pope and declared, “Fight the real enemy!” She denigrated the Catholic wing of the largest religion in the world. Bold move. If you were Catholic, she didn’t care what you thought. She didn’t mind committing what you perceived as heresy. She had the guts to unapologetically offend you, to overtly insult your holy faith: Crrrrrrrickets. Then, she appeared at a concert in New York. Evidently, the Catholics in the audience didn’t much appreciate her recent denigration; they expressed that fact by booing. Suddenly, the woman who fearlessly offended millions ran off stage crying. If you can’t take it, don’t dish it out. Here she is, not taking it: Guess she wasn’t so tough after all. Her song “Nothing Compares 2 U” (written by Prince) had gone to #1 in 1990, followed by the hit “I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got.” With one move insulting a sizable portion of the planet, she killed her career. Perhaps unsurprisingly, years later, O’Connor admitted she suffered from bipolar disorder and suicidal thoughts. She even appeared on Dr. Phil to talk about it. Guess she did want what she didn’t have, after all. Too bad she wasn’t able to remain relevant; she would’ve loved the Catholicism-lampooning 2018 MET Gala (here). But maybe relevancy is back, Jack! Now Sinead has a new reason to make headlines. And something new that’s she’s gotten. Here’s her tweet from last week: “This is to announce that I am proud to have become a Muslim. This is the natural conclusion of any intelligent theologian’s journey. All scripture study leads to Islam. Which makes all other scriptures redundant. I will be given (another) new name. It will be Shuhada.'”  Note Sinea– I mean, Shuhada”s slogan and Nike image next to her new name: “Wear a hijab. Just do it.” Here she is, just doing it:  Wanna hear her sing a Muslim song? You’re in luck, buddy! “Here is my 1st attempt at singing the Azan. I got some pronouncition wrong because emotions took me from my page… but there’ll be hundreds of others onstage to come …”  No word yet on how her Muslim faith fits in with her support for abortion or her stance against oppression, given that many would say Islam is oppressive to women (Hirsi Ali certainly does — here; but Linda Sarsour contends otherwise — here). I’ll give her credit, though, for fighting oppression in one way that would surely fit her newfound Muslim faith (asserting opinions with which I agree) — her 2013 open letter to Miley Cyrus, which included this: “Yes, I’m suggesting you don’t care for yourself. That has to change. You ought be protected as a precious young lady by anyone in your employ and anyone around you, including you. This is a dangerous world. We don’t encourage our daughters to walk around naked in it because it makes them prey for animals and less than animals, a distressing majority of whom work in the music industry and it’s associated media. …I repeat, you have enough talent that you don’t need to let the music business make a prostitute of you. You shouldn’t let them make a fool of you either. Don’t think for a moment that any of them give a flying f*** about you. They’re there for the money. We’re there for the music. It has always been that way and it will always be that way. The sooner a young lady gets to know that, the sooner she can be REALLY in control. …Real empowerment of yourself as a woman would be to in future refuse to exploit your body or your sexuality in order for men to make money from you. I needn’t even ask the question. I’ve been in the business long enough to know that men are making more money than you are from you getting naked. Its really not at all cool. And it’s sending dangerous signals to other young women. Please in future say no when you are asked to prostitute yourself. Your body is for you and your boyfriend. It isn’t for every…dirtbag on the net, or every greedy record company executive to buy his mistresses diamonds with.” According to a Telegraph article, Muslim women are required to keep their hair long. O’Connor told Dr. Phil she’d never grow hers out. Will she thrive under the confining rules of her new religion or decide she has to “fight the real enemy” again? Also, in the past, she’s worn her share of tank tops; when the summer heat comes, I guess we’ll see if Nothing Compares 2 a Burqa. Relevant  link in this article: here, here, and here.

        "articles": "“These are the kind of people running the IMF, and we want to turn the world’s finances and the control of the money supply (over) to them?” – Representative Ron Paul describes soon-to-be-former IMF Chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn(HT: Takimag.com) It is said that even the blind squirrel will occasionally get a nut. Under the right collection of screwed up and unusual conditions, The Mississippi River has been known to temporarily flow backwards in some places. Also, Congressman Ron Paul has his days when he is magnificently right. He is on the issue of DSK, but he doesn’t understand the extent to which he was right or even why? Rape-man DSK should be exposed to condign public ignominy. Not over Ron Paul’s quixotic views on money supply or currency management, but rather because he typifies modern world leadership. The type of guy who thinks that he totally should get to bone the cleaning lady if he drops $3K for a hotel room is precisely the sort of person who is running much of the modern world. There is only one antidote to this sort of Son of a NSFW, and that cure is a vigilant public. The elevation of people like DSK to positions of high responsibility not only justifies, but demands the continued existence of organizations like America’s Tea Parties. America is a society that once thrived as a result of checks and balances. Sir Isaac Newton would have loved the US Constitution. Every action seemed to have an equal and opposite reaction. For a long time, this frustrated the partisans and stymied the utopians. However, this also served the American People profoundly well. Yet, even the best engineering designs fail. Walter Russell Mead describes how an elite American Establishment has sought to circumvent this Yin and Yang of American Society and exert dominance without restraint. Mead’s description of the problem follows below. But the United States today — in both parties, in the corporate and business worlds, in academia and among the intelligentsia, in religion and in many other fields — does not have the strong and thoughtful leadership that we need. That is not what the elite thinks, by and large. To listen to many bien pensant American intellectuals and above-the-salt journalists, America faces a shocking problem today: the cluelessness, greed, arrogance and bigotry of the American public. (Ht: the American Interest.com) The sentiments described in the second paragraph above lead the elite to justify self-interested behavior. Once they get the elite position, they don’t think highly of the poor peasants who have to clean and vacuum the $3K hotel rooms. Thus, this elite feels justified in using their positions to fulfill selfish desires in oblivious neglect to the commonweal that they were elected to better and preserve. Peggy Noonan described this detestable tendency as “The Separate Peace.” She defines what this means exactly below. I have a nagging sense, and think I have accurately observed, that many of these people have made a separate peace. That they’re living their lives and taking their pleasures and pursuing their agendas; that they’re going forward each day with the knowledge, which they hold more securely and with greater reason than nonelites, that the wheels are off the trolley and the trolley’s off the tracks, and with a conviction, a certainty, that there is nothing they can do about it. I suspect that history, including great historical novelists of the future, will look back and see that many of our elites simply decided to enjoy their lives while they waited for the next chapter of trouble. And that they consciously, or unconsciously, took grim comfort in this thought: I got mine. Which is what the separate peace comes down to, “I got mine, you get yours.” (HT: PeggyNoonan.com) Only one antidote exists to such an elite “leadership.” They must be challenged. Ironically, it is Famous Black Nationalist, Malcolm X, who describes the role groups like The Tea Party must play in preventing this parlously corrupt, inbred and enstupidated elite from running amok. In his famous “Message to The Grass-Roots” Speech he described the level of dedication required to make Civil Rights for African Americans a national issue in the early 1960’s. We’re going to march on Washington, march on the Senate, march on the White House, march on the Congress, and tie it up, bring it to a halt; don’t let the government proceed. They even said they was going out to the airport and lay down on the runway and don’t let no airplanes land. (HT:sojust.net) Given the current failings of America’s air traffic control system, I wouldn’t recommend lying down on anybody’s runway. However, Malcolm X made a valid and intelligent intellectual point here. We get what we tolerate. Let the government jam Cap-and-Trade or the Individual Mandate down your throat, and you might as well add Tabasco Sauce, because you are going to eat it. The Tea Party checks our detestable leadership, since morality, like Elvis, has long since left the building. Ron Paul got one right when he questioned letting people like DSK handle our nation’s monetary future. However, he missed a vital opportunity to expand the rEVOLution without any loss of generality. Why should a jerk like DSK get to run much of anything, and who’s to stop that sort of iniquitous Cloaca Maximus from becoming just as powerful in the Good ‘Ol US of A? The Tea Party, that’s who! It still remains time to party like 1773. ",

        "articles": "If you watched any of the Democrat debate as I did last night, you had a chance to see two old white people go back and forth, jockeying to see which of them could prove to the masses who was the most far-left-neo-maxi-zoom-dweebie. It was hard to tell. Ever since Sanders has made life difficult for the anointed one, Hillary Clinton, she’s been making a mad walker-assisted dash to the left. Seriously, the title of this post is pretty close to what it was. I wasn’t the only who noticed. Amy Otto tweeted the following: I feel like I’m watching an old couple argue about shades of white paint chips at Home Depot. #DemDebate — Amy (@AmyOtto8) February 12, 2016 Or the grocery story. Bernie: “I told you I wanted the oatmeal without raisins!” Hillary: “The Republicans are going to take away raisins for everybody if we don’t do something!” The debate was not much of a debate. It was more about who was going to give away more stuff, who was going to be tougher on the evil Wall Street companies, evil pharmaceutical companies and evil banks. Who was going to raise taxes more. Who kissed Barack Obama’s tookus more. The list goes on. What neither of them were able to do then entire time I watched, was to lay out any kind of realistic vision for what they expected to do beyond “FIGHT!” (sound familiar) when they get into office. It was all a big leftist welfare state utopia. That said, if you were going to look for two distinct ways these two geezers differentiate themselves from each other, there are two specific instances: 1. Hillary Clinton excels at victim creation. She has said “Flint, Michigan” more than I can count. She seems to think railing about it constantly will help, seemingly forgetting the Environmental Protection Agency knew about Flint’s water issues for over a year and did not act on it. This of course will only be followed with with Hillary calling for an expanded EPA because apparently making the bureaucracy bigger is the way to go in these situations. 2. Bernie Sanders excels at attacking almost anything as a tool of special interests. To listen to the self described socialist, one would think everybody who is not at least a millionaire is somehow getting screwed by somebody. “Roto-rootah is a tool of the big banks who want to “flush” your savings down the terlet when they come by to unclog your crappuh.” What’s really sad is as you listen to their list of just plain idiotic ideas, there’s a bunch of people out there clapping like seals at the prospect of these ideas becoming law. What’s frightening is, either of these two could actually win. To quote Richard Vernon from ‘The Breakfast Club’ in that one of them could be running the country: “This is the thought that wakes me in the middle of the night.” So listen closely while the two old old coots yell and spray the debate moderators with spittle. This country cannot afford what they’re yelling about. ",

        "articles": "So you’re about to watch a video of a Trump supporter who’s not just a random man-on-the-street person. This is a person who was selected to appear on television on purpose because she was perceived by CNN to be a good television spokesperson for Donald Trump supporters (like Amanda Carpenter is for Cruz supporters or Goblin Jeffrey Lord or Edgar Suit Kayleigh MacEnany are at other times for Trump supporters). She was asked, in this clip, about one of Trump’s advisor’s claims that we (non Trump supporters) should all feel better about the crazy things Donald Trump says he’ll do about foreign policy because he doesn’t really mean any of them. This Trump supporter spokeswoman answered, paraphrased, who knows if Donald Trump is lying to us or not? That’s part of the fun! I wish I was making that up. Pamela Brown (CNN): One of Donald Trump’s foreign policy advisors told NPR that Trump will count on advisors, that he wants his advisors to educate, but he also said that Trump won’t follow through on his most extreme campaign promises, like enabling interrogators to torture. That he’s making those statements because it’s, quote, political season. What do you make of that. Adriana Cohen (Professional Trump Supporter): Well, you know, that remains to be seen. Um, Donald Trump is expressing his views right now in real time, it’s captivating the public’s attention, he’s dominating in the delegate count, but I think we’ll see as the campaign progresses, and he is, he does end up becoming President of the United States, um, you know, we’ll see how these policies play out later on. We also have to look at where we are with terrorism in November, and that’s absolutely going to impact any Presidential, any President’s foreign policy at that point. And that’s, go ahead… S. E. Cupp: Two things. I think it’s pretty cynical of Donald Trump if he is purposefully misleading people about what he would do as President. But it’s also, it should be pointed out to supporters like Adriana, a lot of the things he wants to do, he cannot do. He will not be able to do. Whether he wants to, whether he plans on changing his mind later, these are not things that congressionally, constitutionally, international laws will allow him to do, these are things his supporters should be asking… these promisese I like, these proposals I like, um, can these really happen? Pamela Brown: At the same time, the same thing can be said for other candidates too, these promises.. no way they could follow through on them? Some Democrat I’ve never seen before today but who nonetheless wins this exchange hands down with one statement: Okay, number one, when your own supporters are saying, we don’t know if we can believe what he’s saying, we’re gonna have to wait and see? That’s incredible. The scary part is that, for most Trump supporters, the answer Cohen gave was just A-OK. Nothing that bothers them at all. ",

        "articles": "The Speaker of the Republican House of Representatives, has proposed on BEHALF OF US, citizens represented by Republican Congressmen and women, a tax raise of $800 Billion dollars. That is all you need to know. But I’ll tell you more anyway. The main fight is over the fact that President Obama insists on raising tax rates on successful people from a little over 1/3 of their income to nearly 49% of their income. Republicans have rightly opposed such a tax increase on Americans best poised to invest their money in creating new jobs. Unfortunately, that line in the sand won’t cut it for the Speaker. He has instead suggested that to save these tax breaks, we should take tax breaks away from other Americans. He wants to cut out middle class tax cuts. Thus far, the cuts have remained ambiguous but we all know he is talking about deductions for the needy. And when I say the “needy,” I don’t mean people who aren’t working that need help. I’m talking about Americans who are producing wealth, with a portion of that wealth being taken through taxation, then receiving back a smaller portion of the wealth they created in the first place. We know that the Speaker of the House is more impotent than any Speaker in modern history. I say this based on his inability to deliver votes and negotiate in good faith. Boehner has put in his time in leadership but his style and ideas are out of step with the American people. Now, more than ever, it is becoming apparent that this speaker’s ideology and policy goals are out of line with – not only the party faithful, but the electorate and the base. He is a leader without followers. Let’s be clear about the severity of this issue. We have seen the GOP sell social conservatives down the river before. We have seen them wave goodbye to civil liberties. We’ve stood by helplessly as they’ve assaulted federalism and small government. We watched the GOP increased deficits and borrow more money than we could ever pay back. But in twenty years, no republican leader has offered a tax hike. Mr. Boehner has now broken that streak. He believes that his legacy is now on the line and that the President holds all the cards. He doesn’t believe in GOP victory, he only hopes the President will take his Democrat-lite plan. He has bought into the idea of losing. That’s dangerous because whichever side loses this debate will lose support in the polls. If the GOP raises taxes on Americans by eliminating breaks that we rely on or by raising rates, they are no longer fit to have the letter “R” behind their name. This is the party’s sacred cow and even if reasonable people were willing to trade $10 in cuts for $1 in revenue . . . … We. Aren’t. Even. Close. Meanwhile, Boehner has stripped conservatives of Committee assignments because they wouldn’t go along with Obama and him on terrible spending deals over the past two years. Specifically, as Eric Erickson has pointed out, “Congressmen Schweikert, Amash, and Congressman Tim Huelskamp [have] now [been] removed from the Budget Committee [] for daring to defy John Boehner during the debt ceiling fight.” What benefit does Speaker Boehner offer to Republicans in Congress? He can’t lead, he can’t negotiate in good faith, he isn’t an uncanny fundraiser. To be honest, Eric Cantor waiting in the wings isn’t any better, but the time has come for Boehner to go. His leadership offers no tangible benefit to the American people. Boehner’s vision doesn’t represent the views of the majority of the caucus and the President can’t seriously hang his hat on anything Boehner negotiates away anymore. We should be sincerely concerned about Boehner’s ability to lead his party – OUR PARTY and seriously consider a more appropriate alternative, not because Cantor or McCarthy are worth fighting for, but because what we have isn’t working.

        "articles": "During the course of Trump’s angry anti-media diatribe yesterday, Trump repeatedly asserted that the reason it took until last week (coincidentally, on the same day the WaPo ran a damning story about the lies his campaign has told about the funds) for him to send out the checks to the veterans charities is not because he never intended to send the money in the first place, it’s because he and his team had to do such a good job of vetting the organizations to make sure they were doing legitimate work for veterans. Dripping with sarcasm, Trump yelled, “When you send out checks for hundreds of thousands to these groups… [you have to make sure they are doing actual work for vets]… it’s called vetting.” Well, the problem with deciding to hastily send out a bunch of checks after the media has embarrassed you into doing so is that you can’t do a good job of actually vetting them. And so, in less than 24 hours after releasing his list, the media has already found that one of the charities Trump donated to has… wait for it… spent more money fundraising for themselves than they have on benefitting veterans: One of the charities that Donald Trump selected to receive a donation from his veterans’ fundraiser is a group with a rating of “F” from CharityWatch, and has been criticized in the past for spending less than half of its incoming donations on programs that help veterans. * * * An examination of the group’s tax filings shows that the foundation spent just $2.4 million of its total $8 million budget on helping veterans directly in 2014. The group spent the rest of the money in 2014 on fundraising and management expenses, with $3.5 million paid out to professional fundraising companies. Another $2 million went toward salaries and general expenses, including billing and collection services. Those spending priorities are part of a larger pattern revealed in several years of disclosures to the IRS. Nonprofits are required to submit IRS Form 990 each year for accountability. In 2013, the group spent just $2.5 million on veterans from its $8.1 million budget. It spent more than than $3.3 million on fundraising that year and an additional $2 million on “other expenses.” Here’s the thing: getting this information is the easiest thing in the world. By law, any nonprofit organization is required to turn over a copy of its 990 return (you are allowed to redact donor info but the rest has to be turned over) to anyone who asks. You don’t even have to be a prospective donor to ask for this stuff. You send them a request and they have 30 days to turn it over to you, at the very least for inspection. And one of the things you have to clearly display on your 990 return if you are a nonprofit is how much you have actually spent on programs that are in accordance with your stated charitable purpose. In other words, determining whether the veterans’ charity you are donating to spends less than 25% of their budget on actually helping vets is easy. They are actually required to hand over this information to you whether you are going to donate to them or not. It’s not even part of a rigorous vetting process, it’s the absolute first step. The rigorous vetting process begins when you ask for an explanation of what the actual veterans programs are and demand an accounting for those – which, I’m guessing, would reveal some further embarrassing information when it comes to a charity that starts by giving such a paltry amount of its budget to these programs to start with. Now look, you can choose to believe that Trump really did intend to give this money to vets all along and that he’s just been doing vetting work for the last five months. You can choose to believe that Trump really intended to give $1M of his own money – as he repeatedly promised he had already done – and that he wasn’t simply shamed into doing it by the Washington Post last week. It’s not my job to convince anyone not to be a sucker. But it’s not my job to be a sucker, either, and that’s why this story is going to get a whole lot worse for Trump before it’s over. ",

        "articles": "Throughout the presidential campaign, we have been lampooned by the pale-pastel wing of the party for not coalescing around the Romney campaign with alacrity. Our detractors have been stupefied by our stubborn opposition to “the only candidate who can beat Obama;” the man with the requisite resume, funding, organization, intelligence, and persona. We’ve been at a loss to encapsulate our opposition into a one-liner; a bumper sticker. After all, it takes copious pages of ink to explain the extent of Romney’s hypocrisy on the issue of healthcare alone. Yet, late in the 11th hour of the campaign, when it’s probably too late to make a difference, we have finally discovered our symbol that exemplifies Romney. Ironically, it came from his own campaign. Romney’s communication director, Eric Fehrnstrom, had the following exchange with a CNN host: Host: Is there a concern that Santorum and Gingrich might force the governor to tack so far to the right it would hurt him with moderate voters in the general election? Fehrnstrom: Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It’s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again. Aha! That’s exactly what we were looking for! There is no symbol that emblematizes Mitt Romney more than an Etch A Sketch. Later in the day, the LA Times reports that Romney clarified the comments of his spokesman by saying that they didn’t pertain to ideology, just organization. Though Fehrnstrom was specifically asked about Romney’s political positions possibly changing, Romney portrayed the comments as being about his organization. Should he be the nominee, Romney said, the nature of the campaign certainly would change “organizationally.” But “the issues I’m running on will be exactly the same.” “I’m running as a conservative Republican. I was a conservative Republican governor. I’ll be running as a conservative Republican nominee,” he said. “The policies and positions are exactly the same.” Um, no. The comments expressed were clearly about political positions, not organization. We all know that in a general election, any conservative must finish his sentences and clearly articulate why limited government policies will help the economy and create upward mobility for all voters; something that might not be required in a primary. But those positions should never change. In Romney’s case, he never had any core beliefs anyway, except for his consistent support for government-run healthcare. Look, we understand that the comments emanated from a campaign official and not the candidate himself. But these comments just confirm what we’ve always known about the people surrounding him. They are all purveyors of pale pastel political positions (alliteration intended). From their perspective, this is just a game of electoral politics; an opportunity to assume power for power’s sake. Moreover, Fehrnstrom’s comments have struck such a cord with the base because they sum up Romney’s history in one image. Whenever he needs to win a particular political office, he resets the slate and pollinates it with whatever positions he ascertains to be politically expedient. Instead of impudently demanding that we get on board the Romney train, maybe his supporters will provide us with some reason to believe that the Mitt Romney in the general election will not hit the reset button. Or maybe the reset button is exactly what we need to wipe away his obstinate support Romneycare. Cross-posted from The Madison Project ",

        "articles": "Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains (PPRM), which currently faces a lawsuit in Colorado for malpractice and health standard violations, is not licensed or regulated as a health clinic under Colorado state policy. A Media Trackers investigation has revealed and PPRM has confirmed that while individual PPRM doctors and nurses are certified at the state level, the clinics themselves only meet federal level standards and regulation dating back to the 1980s. The malpractice suit was filed against PPRM by Colorado Springs resident Ayanna Byer last month. Byer, whose complaint included a total of six charges, alleged that she was forced to undergo an abortion at a local clinic without proper anesthetic after asking doctors not to go through with the procedure. Byer’s specific reports of battery and negligence are listed in her Complaint and Jury Demand against a PPRM physician identified in the complaint as “Dr. John Doe”. Byer’s allegations have raised red flags about Planned Parenthood’s licensing and health standards, as well as its medical procedures and practices. While standard healthcare and out-patient surgical clinics in the state fall under the authority of the Health Facilities division of the Colorado Department of Health and Environment for regular licensing and regulation, Planned Parenthood clinics are not held to the same standard. When contacted by Media Trackers to verify Planned Parenthood’s clinical licensing and regulation in the the state of Colorado, the Health Affairs division confirmed that PPRM clinics do not fall under the Department of Health and Environment’s oversight and that they were unaware of who in the state government does provide such oversight. Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains informed Media Trackers that its physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, “… maintain licenses and certifications in keeping with the requirements of the Colorado State Medical Board, the Board of Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and their individual certifying organizations.” When asked for specific state licensing and regulation, Planned Parenthood was only able to mention certain federalcompliance and authority for its clinics: “[Our] health centers operate in accordance with OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] regulations … We also must meet the federal standards known as CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments).” However, The Food and Drug Administration explains these standards only cover laboratory testing: “Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) in 1988 establishing quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed.” The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) confirmsthat CLIA addresses only “laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the United States”. The only state level oversight Colorado Planned Parenthood clinics receive appears to be from the Colorado State Board of Pharmacy, which simply licenses each Planned Parenthood location as a pharmacy outlet. Though PPRM claims its individual physicians and nurses are in compliance with the requirements of the Colorado State Medical Board, Byer’s complaint charges that the doctor(s) who performed her abortion did not follow the basic standards or procedures defined and enforced by the medical board. According to the board’s “Office-Based Surgery and Anesthesia” policy, “The surgeon must evaluate and discuss the risks and benefits of the surgical procedure with the patient and obtain informed consent from the patient.” The policy guidance goes on to state that, “Additionally, the surgeon and qualified anesthesia provider must assess the patient before surgery to evaluate the risk of anesthesia.” Byer claimed that the attending physician began the procedure before an anesthetic was administered, and continued without anesthesia after Byer asked to stop. Within Byer’s Complaint and Jury Demand, as reported by Media Trackers, Byer admits that she consented to the abortion only with the promised anesthetic: “Upon Plaintiff’s condition that she would receive anesthesia for pain through an I.V. for which Plaintiff would pay an additional fee, Plaintiff agreed to surgical abortion.” However, PPRM allegedly did not respect the policy to delay the procedure until the patient was under anesthesia: “… before the I.V. was inserted and before the Plaintiff received any anesthesia, the Planned Parenthood Doctor began the procedure to abort the pregnancy”. This alleged lack of concern for the patient’s health and comfort resulted in a series of painful consequences. Byer suffered through a seven minute abortion procedure without anesthetic and was then told that no follow up visit was necessary. After weeks of continued pain, Byer finally visited the emergency room where it was revealed that part of the child was left inside of her and a bad infection had ensued. This led to both battery and negligence charges against the Planned Parenthood doctor, as well as uninformed consent, false imprisonment, extreme and outrageous conduct, and breach of fiduciary duty charges. Though PPRM clinics are not regulated by Colorado medical standards or licensing beyond pharmaceutical regulations, the organization has received millions of dollars in direct aid from the state. In 2012 alone, PPRM was paid $2.7 million by various state level agencies, including over $500,000 from the Department of Health and Environment, the same branch that was unable to cite any state level licensing or regulation of Planned Parenthood in Colorado. Other governmental departments funding Colorado Planned Parenthood in 2012 include the Department of Education, the Justice Department, and the Department of Healthcare Policy and Finance.

        "articles": "On Thursday, Donald Trump made the claim that Ford was going to cut all U.S. jobs and move its operations to Mexico, and as a result he would charge them a large tax for doing so. “They think they’re going to get away with this and they fire all their employees in the United States and…move to Mexico,” said Trump. “When that car comes back across the border into our country that now comes in free, we’re gonna charge them a 35% tax. And you know what’s gonna happen, they’re never going to leave.” The Ford corporation’s CEO, Mike Fields, wasn’t taking that lying down, and appeared on CNN to correct the record. “It’s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts,” he told Poppy Harlow. “And the facts are, Ford’s investment in the U.S. and commitment to American jobs has never been stronger. I mean, we’ve created more than 28,000 jobs in the U.S. in the last five years.” But the truth of the matter is, Ford has brought jobs from Mexico to the U.S. recently as Yahoo Finance reports. Ford began producing the F-650 and F-750 at its assembly plant near Cleveland a year ago after the company spent $168 million converting the factory from building Econoline vans. They previously had been produced in Mexico in a joint venture with Navistar International Corp. known as Blue Diamond Trucking Co., which disbanded in 2014. The automaker now builds its full-size van, known as the Transit, at an assembly plant in Claycomo, Missouri. The company is focusing on building high-margin trucks, vans and sport-utility vehicles in the U.S., where labor costs are more expensive than in Mexico. Ford derives most of its profit from its F-Series truck line, Morgan Stanley has said. And the largest vehicles in the line generate the biggest return, according to analysts. By going it alone in the big-truck market, Ford no longer has to share profits with Navistar. According to CNN Money, that’s not all. Ford has increased its job count in the US by 50% in the last five years. Furthermore, while it has moved it’s big truck production into the U.S., they say they will continue to make their small car product here as well, despite moving some of it to Mexico. In fact, the cars they’re producing in Mexico are their less popular, and less profitable models. So it would appear that Trump’s bluster about Ford is nothing but a cheap way to score outrage points, and put on a show for voters concerned about the job market. In truth, no one is losing any jobs, and Ford is likely going to end up adding more. The reason for Ford moving the production of these cars in the first place is to make room for more profitable ones to be made there in the U.S. factories instead. This will only result in more profit for Ford, which means more production, and more jobs. For a guy who seems concerned with keeping jobs in the U.S., Trump seems to be wanting to stand in the way of more being created. Senior Editor. Culture critic, and video creator.

        "articles": "President Obama has been touring all over the midwest these past few weeks, giving speeches to crowds of fans, anxious to hear what’s next on his agenda. One could be forgiven for believing that these are less about pushing the president’s current agenda, and more about launching the reelection campaign, however this is a charge that the administration adamantly denies. But there is a very simple reason that this is viewed as more of a campaign effort. Boasting bulletproof windows, five inch thick doors, and it’s own oxygen supply, the President has made the rounds for these speeches in a multi-million dollar bus, dubbed “The Beast” by it’s critics. There’s been no shortage of opinions from people and pundits on this bus and how having the President tour around the midwest in a caravan of cars and seated on a tour bus sends the message that he is on the campaign trail and using taxpayer dollars to do it. It appears however, that this might not be the case. According to some sources he hasn’t really been riding these buses much at all. They say, he’s been flying them. Apparently President Obama only rode the buses for a couple of miles at a time, spending the rest of the time flying from community to community in Air Force One. What’s more, the buses were flown from stop to stop as well. It’s normal practice for the President’s entire motorcade to be loaded up on cargo planes and flown from destination to destination. The buses were just a new part of that motorcade. But why wouldn’t the presidential limousine have sufficed? Or one of the other armored vehicles that routinely travel with the President? Apparently because the President wanted the imagery of a bus. And buses are what he got. So good news America! If these reports are true, then not only do you get the pleasure of having a $1.1 million dollar bus carting the President around to “enlist” voters to fight for his reelection, but you get to marvel at the hypocrisy of an administration hell bent on destroying industries with carbon footprints too large for comfort, while they themselves are flying entire caravans of SUVs and buses in giant 747s flanked by fighter jets. All so the president can travel a couple of miles per stop with the image that he’s on the ground with the people when in reality, he couldn’t be more detached from them, their problems, or this continually declining economy. You couldn’t ask for a better metaphor. Follow @Ben_Howe ",

        "articles": "Generally, when a 79 year old man who was known to be in poor health is found dead in his bed with no signs of a struggle, reasonable people do not immediately include “assassination” even if the deceased happened to be one of the most venerated figures in conservative politics. But the Internet is the Internet, and certain less-than-scrupulous websites have long realized that feeding the paranoia of the paranoid is always good for clicks, and so here we are. I’m not going to link to any of these charlatans here, but suffice it to say that the fact that Scalia was found with his head under a pillow is now being used to strongly suggest that Scalia was murdered rather than died of natural causes. And the fact that Scalia’s wishes apparently included the cremation of his remains means that in some corners the freakout is reaching an absolute fever pitch. I guess the story is supposed to go that the pillow is evidence that Scalia might have been suffocated, as opposed to the fact that he just sleeps with his head under a pillow, as tons of people do. How, pray tell, is that supposed to have worked? Scalia’s body was not found until Scalia the person had been missing for quite some time, so his would-be assassin was clearly not in a hurry. One would think that a would-be assassin of an aged and ailing Supreme Court Justice who wanted to make his death look like an accident by smothering him with a pillow might have, you know, bothered to remove the pillow from Scalia’s head so as not to arouse suspicion after he was done with the act, but apparently reasonable thinking is not the currency anyone is trading in today. The fact that Scalia was found inside a closed room with no signs of forced entry and that he was in an apparent state of repose with unwrinkled clothes also does not matter. Personally, I hope an autopsy is performed for the benefit of the public interest but in the absence of more evidence than what we have right now, I can’t say I’m compelled to disagree that it’s up to Scalia’s family as to whether one will be performed. And if one isn’t, I have no idea what indulging in these conspiracy theories will do for the country, but I have no doubt that people who have a financial incentive to stoke those flames will be telling us about the infamous pillow for years to come.

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., left, with Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., speaks to the media after their meeting with President Donald Trump about Venezuela, Tuesday, Jan. 22, 2019, at the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) We were told by our intellectual betters on the left and in the mainstream media that it was a “solemn” day in Washington, D.C. Wednesday as House Democrats prepared to line up in order to enthusiastically vote to impeach President Trump. But at the same time Democrats like Rep. Rashida Tlaib (MI) and others “somberly” laughed all the way to the House floor do their “solemn” duty, Republicans in the Senate were conducting very important business of their own. Confirming more of Trump’s judicial nominees. As I wrote last week, Sen. Majority Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is not messing around when it comes to judicial confirmations, with perhaps the most shining example of him keeping his promises by way of continuing to transform the 9th Circuit, which conservatives and Republicans for years have called the “9th Circus” because of the number of liberal judges appointed to it by Democrats. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) took to the Twitter machine last night in the aftermath of the House’s vote to impeach President Trump in order to provide a timely reminder of what was continuing to take place in the Senate as articles of impeachment were being debated and voted on in the House: Today in the Senate we worked on things that matter to Americans. We continued filling vacancies in the judiciary with good judges. Tomorrow we will confirm more judges & a deputy Sec of State & we will fund the govt for rest of the fiscal year. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) December 19, 2019 What does this bring the total to so far?

And assuming House Speaker Pelosi continues to be wishy washy on whether or not to send the articles of impeachment over to McConnell in the Senate, guess what’s likely to continue to happen?

        "articles": "Adam Schiff has been playing the role of the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland (perhaps an unfortunate analogy for a California Democrat, NTTAWWT) in the House Intelligence Committee probe into we’re not really sure what. He’s been proclaiming loudly and frequently that Trump was in collusion before any evidence has been presented just like the Queen of Hearts proclaiming, “Sentence first — verdict afterwards.” As I posted last night, Schiff was given the opportunity to review the same documents seen by Nunes yesterday. To my surprise he actually looked at them. I’d fully expected him to dismiss them sight unseen because by his nature Schiff is a partisan hack and unrepentant douchenozzle and that is just how he rolls. After looking at them he released this statement: The response I would have expected from Schiff would have been to dismiss them, say they were nothing, and this is a distraction. Let’s look at what he says. First, he starts misrepresenting what has happened. The White House could not have given them to the committee because, as the Fox News report details, the White House didn’t have the documents until a leaker provided Nunes with a list of document numbers, Nunes was stonewalled by the intelligence community, and made his own arrangements to view the documents. He covers a begrudging acknowledgement that the material should be examined by the committee with another lie, that the White House gave Nunes the material. The fact that Schiff totally ignores the information and bitches about the process tells you all you need to know about what he saw. If Schiff has questions about why Nunes acted the way he did, he need look no further than his own behavior. Schiff has been peddling allegations of conspiracy and collusion instead of even giving the pretense of being objective. Small wonder the leaker approached Nunes privately rather than revealing himself to Schiff and a subsequent savaging by Schiff and his Democrat followers. The very fact that the intelligence community refused to allow Nunes to see the documents he request, necessitating NSC intervention, speaks volumes for the way the intelligence community has tied itself to Obama and his administration.

        "articles": "And the saga of gay wedding cakes continues… On Monday, the Supreme Court punted another such case back down the hill to a lower court. As a map, the court’ll have the previous goings-on of the famed Masterpiece Cakeshop decision. In short, SCOTUS ruled in 2018 that Masterpiece proprietor Jack Phillips’s religious beliefs were treated with contempt by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission… Let’s stop for a moment. This is where we are in the political realm: An organization calling itself a “civil rights commission” can be found to have violated someone’s civil rights. Geez Louise. Anyway, essentially, the nation’s highest court said the CCRC was crappy to Jack and targeted him unduly. However, the ruling wasn’t so definitive as to provide a solid precedent for other cases. The court concluded, “The Commission’s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion.” Furthermore: “Phillips was entitled to a neutral decisionmaker who would give full and fair consideration to his religious objection as he sought to assert it in all of the circumstances in which this case was presented, considered, and decided.” And unfortunately: “The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the court.” For more on Masterpiece and Jack’s ongoing troubles, check out my coverage here, here, here, and here. As for Monday, as reported by Fox News: The Supreme Court on Monday threw out a ruling against two Oregon bakers who refused to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple. The couple, Melissa and Aaron Klein, cited religious beliefs as their reason for not providing services for a gay wedding. Now a court will be tasked with determining whether Melissa and Aaron Klein were also persecuted for their religion when Oregon fined them $135,000 for discrimination against a lesbian couple over their cake. As noted by The Daily Wire: If a similar case out of Washington provides any indication, the lower court might rule that the Kleins were treated impartially by the Oregon justice system, forcing the couple to continue fighting for a definitive ruling by the Supreme Court. First Liberty Institute, which is representing the Kleins, sees the SCOTUS move as a good thing: “This is a victory for Aaron and Melissa Klein and for religious liberty for all Americans. The Constitution protects speech, popular or not, from condemnation by the government. The message from the Court is clear, government hostility toward religious Americans will not be tolerated.” Despite the characterization of such cases by some on the left side of the aisle, the issue isn’t one of the government being for or against homosexuality. This is an issue of liberty. Within very forgiving limits, if someone opens a business, they should have the freedom to operate in a manner consistent with their beliefs. That goes for whether it’s about gay marriage or any other thing. The same principle would apply if an anti-religious lesbian couple started a bakery and wouldn’t make cakes celebrating religion. That should be their prerogative, in my view. It’s their business; let them decide what they make. Just my opinion.

        "articles": "The Washington Post approving Biden’s enforcement of a Trump policy that it demonized typifies contemporary journalism. It is such a cliche’ any longer that it almost feels mythical; suggesting the press would outright oppose an issue not on its merits but merely because Donald Trump had proposed it has become legend. We saw it throughout his presidency, and it reached depths last year during the pandemic. It had become the punchline; when the press approached any story it did not begin with an exploration of facts, but instead started with “What is Trump’s position?” The latest example of this is not a massive bombshell but instead is completely innocuous. That non-impactful nature says everything however because it shows just how deep this reactionary opposition to Trump resided within the press. Joe Biden recently came forward with a new budgetary standard in regards to federal spending and placing a priority on American-made goods. The intent with this is to support and strengthen domestic industry production and solidify and even grow the job market. The proposal, made public earlier Wednesday, would require that goods purchased with taxpayer dollars contain 75 percent U.S.-made content by 2029, up from a current threshold of 55 percent. The threshold would rise to 60 percent once the rule goes into effect, and then gradually grow to 75 percent. This was a rather straightforward report, essentially repeating the fed lines from a fact sheet released by the White House. This was made in tandem to Biden’s visit to a truck manufacturing facility last week, in Allentown, PA. The announcement was likely lost amid the other story Biden created, that being his apocryphal claim that he had driven 18-wheelers back in the day. But there is a revelation, from back in other days. The WaPo article featured no negative approach to Biden’s announcement. Most people would think that the concept of buying domestic products is a good thing and, as mentioned in the piece, it is a policy that has been around for generations and backed by most Presidents. The paper was not the least bit critical, not that it was expected to be — unless it intended to remain consistent. In stating that most Presidents support a Buy American policy, that would in fact include Biden’s predecessor, and it was an item that was covered by the Washington Post…in a completely different fashion. While WaPo dutifully repeats this week that Joe Biden wants to “bolster U.S. industry”, there was a completely different assessment of this position when Donald Trump took office. Following his inaugural address, the paper took exception to Trump’s American exceptionalism; we were told how there is “A dark side to ‘Buy American’”. In that piece, from January 2017, we were ushered through the various problems with this proposition, and this being Trump who was promoting this policy that was seen for generations, you could probably guess into what those problems were rooted. Campaigns urging us to buy U.S.-made products are as old as the republic, but they are often shrouded in racism. Trump’s program might sound appealing. But the Buy American exhortation follows a long history of similar campaigns steeped in racism. Buy American presumes an imagined economic nation that pits working people in the United States against those of other countries, casting them as the enemy. From there, it’s often been a quick step to racial distinctions and attacks, as the past has shown. Buy American also has played into the hands of transnational corporations and other elites, who are happy if working people in the United States turn against those from other countries, while the corporations themselves flit about the world seeking low-cost labor. Now, one could say there was not exclusive blame being placed on Trump in this hectoring article. After all, he had simply indicated what his intentions were, at the time, and the piece noted that this was a generational issue, something witnessed for decades. Of course, a couple of things have to be ignored. The first is that the intent was to say Trump would be embracing this deeply problematic approach to federal spending, another sign of his pathological racism that the press loved to allude to. The second issue is what is not seen today. If encouraging domestic spending has such a history of trauma where was mention of this following Joe Biden’s proposal? The Washington Post was inspired to unearth all aspects of the nefarious nature of this effort when Trump was sworn in, but today they are perfectly content to cut-and-paste an administration PR tearsheet. It says everything that the problematic nature of this policy was suddenly evident four years ago but then evaporates entirely when the new President sports a bold blue letter “D” beside his name.

        "articles": "A week ago, while election challenges were still raging — before SCOTUS declined to hear the Texas lawsuit — Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe spoke to Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo about how the election, thanks largely to the COVID pandemic, was materially changed into something the nation has never seen before, and how the pandemic, and by extension China, played a role in the lingering questions surrounding the election. Ratcliffe told Bartiromo that China’s suppression of information surrounding the pandemic in the early days of the outbreak led to the virus’ spread around the world and that this affected “how people had to vote” in the 2020 general election in the U.S. He detailed how state legislatures — sometimes as late as 90 days before the election — instituted new voting procedures and adopted universal mail in balloting leading to the confusion still rampant and the allegations of vote fraud In an op-ed published on Dec.3, Ratcliffe wrote in the Wall Street Journal that China has no intention of stopping their push to sit atop the “global order”: China believes that a global order without it at the top is a historical aberration. It aims to change that and reverse the spread of liberty around the world. Beijing is preparing for an open-ended period of confrontation with the U.S. Washington should also be prepared. Leaders must work across partisan divides to understand the threat, speak about it openly, and take action to address it. Ratcliffe told CBS’ Catherine Herridge around the same time that China was targeting lawmakers in an attempt to get “laws and policies out of the United States that are favorable to China.” #China NOTE TIMING + LAWMAKERS WARNED: In this extended clip from exclusive @CBSNews interview 12/3 @DNI_Ratcliffe said he briefed members of HOUSE + SENATE intelligence committees “earlier this summer,” about Chinese Communist Party’s blackmail strategy targeting lawmakers. pic.twitter.com/ycsBhMj3v0 — Catherine Herridge (@CBS_Herridge) December 13, 2020 What makes the DNI Director’s statements particularly interesting is the existence of a 2018 executive order signed by President Trump that found “the ability of persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States to interfere in or undermine public confidence in United States elections, including through the unauthorized accessing of election and campaign infrastructure or the covert distribution of propaganda and disinformation, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.” The executive order mandates that “45 days after the conclusion of a United States election, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the heads of any other appropriate executive departments and agencies (agencies), shall conduct an assessment of any information indicating that a foreign government, or any person acting as an agent of or on behalf of a foreign government, has acted with the intent or purpose of interfering in that election…The Director of National Intelligence shall deliver this assessment and appropriate supporting information to the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security.” Further, the order allows for sanctions on any person or entity found to have worked on behalf of a foreign government toward interfering in a U.S. election. December 18 will mark 45 days since election day. ",

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Earlier in the week, former FBI deputy assistant director for counterintelligence and known adulterer Peter Strzok testified before a joint hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. I foresee this being used as a meme or gif. #Creepy #Strzok #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/uUHC7wv7EP — Holly Bowie (@Hollybowie) July 12, 2018 I’m not sure what we learned from this beyond seeing just how creepy and unbalanced Strzok is and wondering why any woman would talk to him much less have an extramarital affair. But one interesting item did come out courtesy of Louis Gohmert. The subject was Hillary Clinton’s emails, a subject Strzok and McCabe and Comey wanted to drop like a hot potato. Via The Daily Wire: “You said earlier in this hearing you were concerned about a hostile foreign power affecting our election,” Gohmert said to Strzok. “Do you recall the former Intelligence Community Inspector General Chuck McCullough having an investigation into an anomaly found on Hillary Clinton’s emails?” “I do not,” Strzok replied. “Let me refresh your recollection,” Gohmert said. “The Intelligence Community Inspector General Chuck McCullough sent his investigator Frank Rucker along with an ICIG attorney Janette McMillan to brief you and Dean Chapelle and two other FBI personnel that I won’t name at this time, about an anomaly they had found on Hillary Clinton’s emails that were going to and from the private unauthorized server that you were supposed to be investigating.” “Now do you remember it?” Gohmert asked. Strzok answered: “I remember meeting Mr. Rucker on either one or two occasions. I do not recall the specific content or discussions.” Gohmert fired back, saying, “Mr. Rucker reported to those of you, the four of you there, in the presence of the ICIG attorney, that they had found this anomaly on Hillary Clinton’s emails going through their private server, and when they had done the forensic analysis, they found that her emails, every single one except four, over 30,000, were going to an address that was not on the distribution list. It was a compartmentalized bit of information that was sending it to an unauthorized source.” This is particularly interesting in light of the nonsense being pushed by the media over a single sentence in the indictment-by-media reports that Mueller issued yesterday. The 30,000 emails missing, due to an unfortunate use of Bleach Bit by the mope operating Hillary Clinton’s private server, were only lost to the US government. Even without this mail forwarding operation, we know that multiple foreign intelligence services had compromised her server. And reasonable people understood that Trump’s stump speech slamming Clinton over the missing emails was not a call to hack her…that had already happened…but to underscore the fact that unfriendly foreign governments had those emails. The thing that has always struck me about the whole Hillary Clinton email fiasco is the studious lack of curiosity by the US government over how TS/SCI documents were removed from a SCIF and transmitted via garden variety email and stored on a server that had no cyber or physical security. No curiosity was expressed about a document that appeared to have been produced via signals intelligence sources being sent by the half-assed “intelligence” group headed by Sid Blumenthal and the fortunately deceased Tyler Drumheller to Clinton (see here | here). The lack of curiosity extended so far as to give immunity from prosecution to the guy managing it. McCabe was totally incurious about what was on Huma Abedin’s laptop inasmuch as it included Clinton’s emails. And when told by the ICIG that Hillary Clinton’s emails had been auto-forwarded to a foreign power…no interest whatsoever. omg @Carpedonktum 😂pic.twitter.com/Vm2Qc9alOq — Katica (@GOPPollAnalyst) July 14, 2018 ========= ========= Like what you see?

        "articles": "There was a minor stir in the world of politics a couple of days ago when the Associated Press ran a story headlined: US Catholic bishops may press Biden to stop taking Communion. When U.S. Catholic bishops hold their next national meeting in June, they’ll be deciding whether to send a tougher-than-ever message to President Joe Biden and other Catholic politicians: Don’t receive Communion if you persist in public advocacy of abortion rights. At issue is a document that will be prepared for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops by its Committee on Doctrine, with the aim of clarifying the church’s stance on an issue that has repeatedly vexed the bishops in recent decades. It’s taken on new urgency now, in the eyes of many bishops, because Biden — only the second Catholic president — is the first to hold that office while espousing clear-cut support for abortion rights. The Washington Post weighed in with this: A rising group of right-wing U.S. Catholic bishops is colliding with a very Catholic president who supports abortion rights.  — The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) April 28, 2021 The Washington Post, being the Washington Post, tries to paint it in the light of electoral politics and, as it is written by someone who is unacquainted with Catholicism in any meaningful way, it has that “Gorillas in the Mist” flavor. Having a U.S. president who attends Mass week after week and talks about his faith is powerful to millions of American Catholics. But to millions of others, a Catholic U.S. president enacting one policy after another in favor of abortion access is a source of shame. This conflict is now headed directly at the U.S. church’s leadership group, which plans a vote about it at its spring conference. … Now there is a Catholic U.S. president for the first time since the early 1960s, and one who is passionately open about both his Catholic faith and his liberal politics on topics like reproductive freedom and LGBTQ equality — both areas with which he and a majority of other U.S. Catholics disagree with their church’s doctrine. The AP article is good as far as it goes as it reflects a tension, though a very fraudulent one, that exists among Catholic prelates about the Church’s relationship with the secular world and its desire to continue suckling at the teat of the government cash cow versus those who adhere to the faith and see the danger of the Church becoming just another secular, do-gooder group. This is not a left vs. right issue within the Catholic Church. It is a long-simmering conflict between Catholics who believe in the Faith as passed on by Jesus Christ and the Catholic-Lite types who pooh-pooh the work of salvation and evangelization and champion all manner of bad behavior under the rubric of “pastoral care” and “accompanying” of people who are not in compliance with Church teachings, who have no intention of ever complying with Church teachings, and who hold the whole “thou shalt not” part of Scripture in contempt. Let’s clear away some underbrush. Joe Biden is not “very Catholic.” At best, he’s a “smells and bells” Catholic. There is a huge question mark over the status of his marriage to Frau Doktor Professor Jill Biden. She’s divorced, her ex-husband alleges Jill and Joe were rutting while she and he were married, which resulted in the divorce, so there are questions that I can’t answer from my research, but if Joe is going to claim he’s a devout Catholic, merit exploration. That, however, is the least of the issues. His active promotion of abortion means that he has excommunicated himself, the term is latae sententiae, from the Catholic Church according to Canon Law. The left likes to claim this is just Biden enforcing the “law of the land,” and as we have an alleged wall of separation between Church and state, Biden is just doing his job. This is just bullsh**. Since entering office, Biden has acted to expand abortion by his abandonment of the so-called Mexico City policy. This is a willing and affirmative act that knowingly increases the number of aborted babies. Likewise, Biden’s minions have moved to attempt to overturn a court decision that held that doctors could not be forced to perform sex-change operations against their will. I don’t know why anyone would want to try to force a doctor to do such a thing…you might emerge from the process with excess parts stapled to your forehead…but you know how these people roll, right? Here is a thread with more detail. #BREAKING: The Biden Admin just filed an appeal seeking to force religious doctors and hospitals to perform potentially harmful gender-transition procedures against their conscience and professional medical judgment. This is bad for patients, doctors, and religious liberty. 1/ — Luke Goodrich (@LukeWGoodrich) April 20, 2021 Like with abortion, this is not merely the enforcement of something that just happens to exist and which can’t be changed by a president that also violates the Catechism of the Catholic Church and Canon Law, this is Biden aggressively acting to impose policies that did not exist upon the nation of his own volition. Biden’s dismissal of core Church teachings runs deep. He officiated at a homosexual wedding. Not only was the wedding not licit…the Church does not recognize civil ceremonies, and conducting one simply give a fig leaf of legitimacy to allow people to enter a state of mortal sin…it was a great scandal (see paragraph 2284) by portraying himself as some sort of devout believer while engaging in an act expressly forbidden by the Church. Though I oppose Biden and am among that majority of Republicans and conservatives who do not acknowledge Biden as lawfully elected, I would be opposed to denying him the Eucharist based upon his benefiting from the corruption of an election and the theft of the presidency. The Eucharist is not a prize for the worthy. It is not a cudgel to be used against people you don’t like. That said, the basic rule of the Church is: As Catholics, we fully participate in the celebration of the Eucharist when we receive Holy Communion. We are encouraged to receive Communion devoutly and frequently. In order to be properly disposed to receive Communion, participants should not be conscious of grave sin and normally should have fasted for one hour. A person who is conscious of grave sin is not to receive the Body and Blood of the Lord without prior sacramental confession except for a grave reason where there is no opportunity for confession. In this case, the person is to be mindful of the obligation to make an act of perfect contrition, including the intention of confessing as soon as possible (canon 916). A frequent reception of the Sacrament of Penance is encouraged for all. Allowing Biden to continue to receive Communion while not merely supporting abortion and transgenderism, and homosexual marriage but actively promoting them and sending out his goons to proclaim him to be a devout Catholic is wrong. It is not wrong from a political stand point, it is wrong from a pastoral point of view. Every time Joe Biden steps up to receive the Eucharist he is showing the world that some Catholic bishops believe that there are one set of rules for the mopes in the pews who pay the bills and another set for the Very Important People who send billions of tax dollars to Church causes. If the US Conference of Catholic Bishops doesn’t want to take any action that will draw the Church into a highly polarized political environment, that is understandable. But that is not what is happening. What is happening is that Biden is openly and loudly proclaiming that he is a faithful Catholic while actively undermining Catholic teaching. That is why they should act to make it clear that not only is Joe Biden not a faithful Catholic, he isn’t even repentant for the harm his horrible example sets for Catholics who might not know any more about Catholicism than a religion writer for the Washington Post. As an afterthought: One of the favorite games of David French and other leftists is “what about Trump?” If you read Twitter or Facebook on the Biden/Communion issue, you’ll inevitably see leftists and Bulwark and Dispatch writers making a claim to the effect that “this is all politics because no bishops made any noise about Trump’s adultery (to the extent that it is different that what is alleged about the Bidens) and divorces.” Easy answer. Trump is not a Catholic. He didn’t even play one on the internet. The Catholic Church does not impose sanctions on members of other denominations for their transgression of Catholic doctrine. Plus, Trump never tried to receive Communion in a Catholic Church. Former infantry officer, CGSC grad and Army Operations Center alumnus.  member since 2004. Follow me on Twitter. ",

        "articles": "On Tuesday, The Federalist published “It’s Time For The United States To Divorce Before Things Get Dangerous.” This proposal should, and must, be forcefully rejected. It is therefore prudent for another conservative outlet to provide a public dissent. The Federalist writer Jesse Kelly argues today’s differences between Americans are irreconcilable: The history of the world is nations breaking up and redrawing their borders. If we want to avoid this political divide turning into a deadly one, we should do likewise… We are a nation hopelessly divided. We are more divided now than we have ever been in our history. And before you start screaming at me about the Civil War, keep in mind that bloody conflict was fought over one major issue. Considering over 600,000 Americans died, it seems misguided to so quickly dismiss the Civil War. But even absent that specific conflict, American history has been marked by constant strife over political and ideological differences. After the Civil War, racial tensions divided America to the point that black Americans were mistreated by both their fellow Americans and their government, through Reconstruction, Jim Crow laws, lynchings, “separate but equal” policies and segregation, and the civil rights movement and the assassination of its leaders. Other differences, unrelated to civil rights, have also been so extreme that our government often engaged. For example, the Sedition Act of 1798 restricted political speech; Woodrow Wilson’s Department of Justice conducted the Palmer Raids on suspected radicals; Andrew Jackson forced 16,000 Native Americans onto the Trail of Tears; Franklin Roosevelt placed Americans of Japanese descent in internment camps; McCarthyism fed an environment of paranoia about other Americans; and the Ohio National Guard killed four college students protesting the Vietnam War. Simply put, the sheer size, history, and multicultural background of the United States makes differences of opinion inevitable. Unfortunately, the most extreme voices are often the most amplified, and social media further exaggerates and intensifies our differences while simultaneously feeding our confirmation biases. These differences are then boosted by our country’s enemies, who want to pit us against each other. It is a mistake to fall into that trap or to believe the United States is not worth remaining united. The United States Constitution and the government created by it are, collectively, the greatest democratic experiments in the history of mankind. That our country has survived for 242 years with only one civil war, and that we came together afterwards, is a remarkable testament to our country’s ability to endure and to unite. The Right often argues that those on the Left do not always appreciate America’s uniqueness or exceptionalism. We should not join them in making that error. America sets an example for the rest of the world — for what they should be and what they could be. America is a beacon for liberty; a shining city on a hill; and the embodiment of dreams, hopes, and aspirations. And a separation would not be peaceful; it would be immensely difficult to divide a country of over 325 million people, across 3.8 million square miles, in a way that would satisfy its citizens. There are conservatives and liberals in every state, just like every state contains both American history and American landmarks. We would be wholly unable to agree how to split the country up, and it would prove entirely destructive to all involved. A split would be financially devastating. The United States is currently among the world’s strongest, wealthiest, and most stable countries. Such a split would not only leave individual bank accounts in ruins, it would be an extraordinary waste of money, it would throw world markets into chaos, and any newly created countries would be poorer than the United States is now. Furthermore, our very existence makes the world safer and more stable. The dissolution of the United States would have a catastrophic global effect by destabilizing the entire world. It would create an enormous power vacuum that our enemies would certainly try to exploit, while other nations would likely fail in stopping them. It is evident by the mere suggestion of dissolution that Americans are spoiled by stable government, in that we are able to take it for granted — a luxury that many around the world and throughout history were not lucky enough to enjoy. Rather than call for the dissolution of the United States, we should thank God every day that we are Americans. The dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric must be toned down — from both sides. For example, recently Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey approvingly shared a similar article, causing many on the Right to — justly — criticize him. And it is true that some on the Left engage in utterly atrocious behavior while receiving passes from the media, like Senator Kamala Harris joking about killing the U.S. president, to little outrage. The hypocrisy is infuriating. But it helps no one to stoop to such a level in retaliation. To be fair, some have claimed the Federalist piece is simply satire, but the author has repeatedly said he is serious and advocated this idea, while other people are treating the article both seriously and approvingly. Furthermore, The Federalist isn’t the only conservative organization promoting this idea. Townhall has published numerous pieces about American civil war. But Republicans control a significant portion of our government, which shows just how unserious this proposal truly is. Under President Obama, Democrats have lost 900+ state legislature seats, 12 governors, 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats. That's some legacy. — Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) November 4, 2015 The 2016 election gave Republicans control of both the executive and legislative branches, with the possibility of four Supreme Court nominations over the course of the presidency, as well as a majority of governor offices and state legislative chambers. Sharp insight from a friend: The American left is in despair over its lack of political power, and the American right is in despair over its lack of cultural power. Everyone focuses on the battles they're losing. — #TestAndTrace Smith 🐇 (@Noahpinion) April 11, 2018 Yes, there are aspects of pop culture, the media, and academia that often mock Republicans. But the solution is not to shut ourselves off or divide our country up. There are some battles we cannot win — it will never be popular or fun to be the adult in the room who tells people that there is no such thing as “free” — but there are some we can win. Republicans should fight. But we should fight smart. We should convince people by showing why our ideas and principles are better. To advocate anything else should not even be considered. We are Americans, every single one of us. America has survived a civil war; assassinations of her presidents; resignations by her presidents; corrupt administrations; and wars that bitterly divided the country. It has survived because America is more than a nation — it’s an idea that we cannot allow to die. Neither America’s recent nor distant history is perfect or without shame, but we’ve been moving in a positive direction due to the core American values that guide us. Abolitionists, suffragettes, civil rights leaders, feminists, and more have fought for the rights of other Americans. We have fought communism and socialism, defeated an “evil empire,” saved Europe (multiple times), and demanded walls be torn down. Our medical breakthroughs have saved an untold number of lives. We have charted new territory, first across the West and then in space, as the first humans on the moon. And when our fellow Americans are in need, we do what we can to help them. The American spirit can be seen in all sorts of ways: The hijackers failed, just as other attempts to destroy America have failed. Because being American means so much more than one’s political beliefs. Generations of men and women have died for our flag. Let’s not allow their deaths to have been in vain by destroying America from within.  Get off Twitter. Talk to your neighbors. Engage with your communities. Remember that we are all Americans. As we should be. As we are blessed to be. E pluribus unum. The views expressed here are those of the author and do not represent those of any other individual or entity.

        "articles": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers were just released and — in a bit of bad news for the Biden administration — they indicated inflation rose faster in April 2021 than it had in 12 years. The Consumer Price Index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year earlier. A Dow Jones survey had expected a 3.6% increase. The month-to-month gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. … The increase in the annual headline CPI rate was the fastest since September 2008, while the monthly gain in core inflation was the largest since 1981. Energy prices overall jumped 25% from a year earlier, including a 49.6% increase for gasoline and 37.3% for fuel oil. That came even though most energy categories saw a decline in April. Gas consumers don’t need to see those numbers to know they’ve been paying more at the pump. Nor do people looking to buy a used car or a new home. But that bad news didn’t stop White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki from telling Americans that the rising prices were simply a sign of the Biden administration’s “successful economic strategy” in a word salad answer to a reporter’s question Thursday. It’s all about the data, man. .@PressSec on rising consumer prices: \"It reflects the reality of an economy that’s rapidly turning back on because of a successful economic strategy.\" pic.twitter.com/4PmhonF6eX — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) May 13, 2021 Psaki said: “Some reaction to the CPI numbers that came out just yesterday…ya know, our view on that is it reflects the reality of an economy that’s rapidly turning back on because of a successful economic strategy. If you dig into the data, there are a couple of factors at play that I think people are taking a look at now that we’ve dug into the data more; including the fact that, for example, airfare has increased by 10 percent but we’re still almost 20 percent below pre-pandemic levels. One of the biggest impacts we saw in the data yesterday was on used car sales, and that is a direct impact of the semiconductor chip shortage, so the point is there’s a number of factors here that can be explained and we’re working to address and, uh, I think as we continue to communicate that, um, hopefully that will give some comfort to the American people and of course, industries.” Translation: Yeah, it’s bad. But we’re going to find data points we can reasonably find a way to explain away so you’ll all think we’re doing better at this than we are. She has some help. In addition to rising prices, one of the main reasons for the big annual gain was because of base effects, meaning inflation was very low at this time in 2020 as the Covid pandemic caused a widespread shutdown of the U.S. economy. Year-over-year comparisons are going to be distorted for a few months because of the pandemic’s impact. Federal Reserve policymakers and many economists are dismissing the current round of numbers as transitory, with the expectation that inflation settles down later this year around the 2% range targeted by the central bank. The pandemic is to blame, you see, because it made inflation artificially low last year by comparison. We — and our wallets — shall soon discover if that’s true. In the meantime, don’t be surprised to hear a lot about something called the Phillips Curve, an economic theory that “claims that with economic growth comes inflation, which in turn should lead to more jobs and less unemployment.” The administration could start using that excuse if things don’t improve soon. So keep this report from Cato handy when you do, because there are plenty of questions about the reliability of the theory. The Federal Reserve continues to incorporate the Phillips curve in its macroeconomic models even though the empirical evidence for a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment is weak at best. In a recent study by the Brookings Institution, the authors note that the Fed still relies on the Phillips curve as a “key factor” in setting its policy rate and as a “tool … to forecast what will happen to inflation when the unemployment rate falls, as it has in recent years” (Ng, Wessel, and Sheiner 2018: 1–2). This article traces the history of the Phillips curve and argues that it is a poor guide for monetary policy. The underlying problem is that the Phillips curve misconstrues a supposed correlation between unemployment and inflation as a causal relation. In fact, it is changes in aggregate demand that cause changes in both unemployment and inflation. The Phillips curve continues to misinform policymakers and lead them astray. At the very least, Psaki’s attempts to redefine “economic success” should be fun to watch through the tears. ",

        "articles": "Recently Google and Facebook announced that they would be cracking down on ‘fake news’ sites that routinely make the rounds on social media with salacious headlines and outlandish stories. Many people rejoiced. We’ve all been annoyed by some ridiculous headline shared hysterically by a friend or family member. “Obama to Imprison All White People!” “Michelle Obama Says She Wishes America Would Catch Fire and Die!” “George Bush Says He Hopes to Own Slaves One Day!” It is supremely annoying that anyone makes those headlines, let alone shares them. On Wednesday the L.A.Times published a compilation of ‘fake news’ sites written by an assistant professor at a Massachusetts college. Melissa Zimdars included a lot of verified ‘fake news’ sites, including Addicting Info and Being Liberal. Sadly she also included a few very established and legitimate news organizations as well. Melissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, put together a publicly available Google doc cataloging “False, misleading, clickbait-y and satirical ‘news’ sources.” It’s been making the rounds on social media as people seek to cleanse their newsfeeds of misinformation… …”Not all of these sources are always or inherently problematic, neither are all of them fake or false,” Zimdars notes in the document. “… They should be considered in conjunction with other news/info sources due to their tendency to rely on clickbait headlines or Facebook descriptions, etc.” Farther down, she gives tips for how people can identify potentially fake news. Things like strange domain names, unusual domain extensions, and using ALL CAPS should be warning signs. And make sure to look for who else is reporting the news: “Sometimes lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event.” Zimdars claims that not all of these sites are fake news. Some are identified as only using ‘misleading’ or ‘click-baity’ headlines. Of course,  doesn’t belong in any of these categories, but it did not stop her from lumping us into one big “FAKERS WHO FAKE WRITE ABOUT FAKE THINGS!” category. As my colleague at  points out, isn’t it funny that Buzzfeed – the originators of the click-bait headlines – are not on this? Zimdars includes conservative media giants IJReview, The Blaze, and  – all organizations that provide aggregate reporting and opinion pieces. Having worked for all three organizations at one point or another, I can say with full certainty that not one is a ‘fake news’ site – or even misleading. In fact,  writers go to great lengths to debunk false stories they find in the media.  has produced some of the top conservative talents, including former Editor-in-Chief Erick Erickson, and regularly features articles submitted by members of the House and Senate and from presidential candidates. The  Gathering is covered by major media, and has top caliber speakers and was even the site of the announcement of a Presidential campaign (Rick Perry.)  content is regularly featured in the mainstream press and has been quoted frequently by even such old-school journalism outlets as The New York Times many times this year alone. IJReview is based in Washington D.C. and has a very strong and lucrative relationship with Facebook, even teaming up with the social media behemoth to produce one of the primary debates. Their reputation on Capitol Hill is well-known, and politicians and high-profile media personalities regularly contribute guest posts. The Blaze provides a lot of opinion pieces some people like Zimdars might disagree with, but they most certainly do not post ‘fake news’ or even misleading headlines. MSNBC regularly produces sensational headlines that aren’t backed up by the research but funny enough; they are nowhere on this list. No mainstream liberal reporting agency is on this list. Zimdars’ list is making the rounds today, and it is outrageous. She needs to put herself on her list, as it is salacious and irresponsible and just a click-bait piece. The L.A.Times needs to be on this list for publishing it! Shame on you all. Zimdars’ lack of perspective is dangerous. It affects the lives of good, hardworking writers who excel at bringing the latest news and opinion to their readers. This is not a game; this is our livelihood. And the Los Angeles Times used a misleading combination of screenshot and text in a tweet about “fake” news, compounding the problem. The L.A.Times and Zimdars owe our organization and others mentioned an apology and a retraction. I demand both, as an op-ed writer dedicated to honesty in opinion and reporting. I hate the fake news sites as much as the next person, but I am incredibly leery of the powers-that-be at Google and Facebook having the power to block what they consider fake news. Someone has to make the judgment about what is fake, and that someone will come to the table with their ignorance and bias. That is extremely dangerous for good, honest writers who work for organizations like  – conservative organizations that might not portray the same point of views as the 21-year-old college intern deciding what’s “fake” in the first place.

        "articles": "One of the things that pundits of marginal intellectual heft who are mostly into politics for the bloodsport like to say is that anyone who votes for a third party candidate in November is basically voting for Hillary. Politico reported yesterday that our old boss Erick Erickson was meeting with some people in D.C. yesterday in an attempt to fire up a third party bid as a contingency plan for a Trump nomination. As a result, our contact form inbox was flooded with angry emails from dozens of Hannity listeners all making this “point.” The argument, if you can call it that, would not be tremendously persuasive if it were true. However, we don’t really even have to engage that, because it turns out that it’s not true. In order to believe that this were actually true, you’d have to just not understand how elections work in America. See, it would be true if, for instance, Donald Trump had to reach some arbitrary threshold (like 50%) in the general election in order to win all the electoral votes for that state. But that isn’t how it works. If Trump gets 35%, and Hillary Clinton gets 34%, and Rick Perry gets 31%, Trump wins exactly the same as if he had beaten Hillary 80%-20% straight up. So the simple fact is that it matters to Trump in equal measures that a) you vote for him and b) you don’t actually vote for Hillary. Voting for a third party candidate deprives Trump of positive outcome a) but allows him to preserve the equally important positive outcome b). Let me illustrate this with a hypothetical state that has exactly six residents. Imagine that the first five residents all go vote, and the result is Donald Trump 3, Hillary Clinton 2. Right now, Trump is leading 60%-40%. Last guy is trying to decide how he’s going to vote. Trump would probably prefer that last guy votes for Trump, giving him the 67%-33% win. However, if the last guy is making a decision between voting for Hillary (which would result in the race ending up a tie) and voting for Third Party candidate Rick Perry (resulting in Trump winning the state 3-2-1), or just not voting at all (resulting in Trump winning the state 3-2), Trump would sure as hell rather have the guy vote third party (or not vote) than actually vote for Hillary. So, if you are a Trump supporter, then someone voting third party is not as good as someone voting for Trump, but neither is it as bad as someone actually voting for Hillary. Not by a long shot. And anyone who tells you differently is either not very smart, or trying to sell you propaganda, or both. Personally, if I were in the position of someone who really wanted Trump to win, I would prefer that people not learn this truth, and so I’d stop saying it. I know that if Trump gets the nomination, the likelihood that I’ll vote for a third party candidate will depend on whether I believe that he’s going to lose regardless of what I do. In that case, I will happily cast my third party protest vote and vote for all the other Republicans on ticket. If I think he might actually win, then I might have to take the more drastic step of considering a vote for Hillary, which I promise you would be worse for Trump’s chances. ",

        "articles": "UPDATE: Reading the release a little more carefully, this is the first budget cut in Texas in 50 years. I have no idea when the last other state was to actually reduce spending. I would welcome if anyone has the answer to this question. Via the Texas Public Policy Foundation, the Texas Legislature has reached a deal for the upcoming fiscal which actually cuts government spending. This is not a reduction in the rate of growth, it is not a cut based on a proposed budget, it is not a series of accounting gimmicks, the State of Texas will actually spend less money next fiscal year than it did last year. In so doing, it will be the first state in 50 years to actually implement a real reduction in spending. From the TPPF release: This state budget deal is a victory for all Texans – and especially for the Texans who worked hard over the past several months to remind our legislators that they wanted a fiscally conservative state budget. The announced budget deal is a win for Texas on three specific points: • It does not use a single penny of the rainy day fund for the next biennium. • It does not raise taxes. • It does represent the first all-funds reduction to a biennial state budget in the past half-century. “What happened in the Texas Legislature this session is more than just a victory for Texans. It’s a victory for America. Texas already leads the way in job creation, economic vitality, and economic liberty. Now Texas is leading the way in the most important cause facing our country: the need to live within our means. “Today, in Austin, Texas, the men and women of our legislature showed it can be done. That’s a tremendous accomplishment for Texas – and it’s a shining beacon of hope for America.” Indeed. Let us hope that John Boehner is paying attention – this is the kind of leadership the American people expect from Congress. Not budget gimmicks, not reductions in the rate of the Federal Government’s growth, but some evidence that the government is actually spending less from year to year. And while liberals and go-along-get-along Republicans claim that actual cuts to government spending will create economic disaster, the experience in Texas proves the exact opposite, as Texas remains the strongest state in the country in terms of economic growth. Cut the budget. Make government smaller. Grow American businesses. Texas is proving it can be done. ",

        "articles": "Leave it to the libertarian to…not try and control how people think and act. Reason Magazine is reporting some interesting comments Sen. Rand Paul made in response to claims that a third party vote is a vote for Hillary: You know, (four second pause) they aren’t the same. I mean, everybody has their decision to make on how they will vote. Some people are very practical minded, and they say “In all likelihood it’s going to be Trump or Clinton. Which is the least bad?” And many will vote that way. And some will say, “No but I truly believe in limited government, the Constitution and a non-interventionist foreign policy, and I have a consistent philosophy. I want a candidate more of my liking.” And they may well vote for, you know, a third party at that point. So the debate has to be [with] each individual. All I can tell you is from my point of view, I’ve made my complaints about our nominee quite explicit. I continue to do so, but also don’t see it as my job now—the thing is, is: I do think that my word is important. I signed a document, not under duress, but I signed a document saying I wouldn’t run as a third party [candidate] and I will support the nominee. And I’ve supported nominees I haven’t been perfectly happy with. I wasn’t perfectly happy in 2012; I knew a guy that would have been a lot better in 2012. Paul is right to not agree with the view that “a vote for anyone but Trump is a vote for Hillary.” If a vote is cast for Gary Johnson (LP) or Darrell Castle (CP) or Jill Stein (GP), that vote doesn’t add to Hillary’s tally. Worst case scenario, it just doesn’t affect the grand scheme of things. What Paul is saying about voting is really a variation of Sen. Ted Cruz’s “vote your conscience” statement, just more fleshed out. For some reason, people thought Cruz was advocating people vote against Trump, when that wasn’t the case at all. As Paul explains, voting your conscience can mean voting based on practicality OR principle. It is about leaving the decision to the individual not to make a certain choice, but to make the choice they want. As I conclude this post, it occurs to me that Paul displayed more critical thinking in those two paragraphs than Donald Trump has this entire campaign…we would be lucky if the Kentucky Senator put his hat in ring again in 2020.

A group of Washington Post reporters “reconstructed” law enforcement efforts to clear protestors from Washington D.C.’s Lafayette Square ahead of President Trump’s highly criticized visit to St. John’s Church on June 1. The reporters then prepared a video which details the timeline of actions taken by the Park Police and federal officers to secure the area. (The video can be viewed by clicking on the tweet below.

Fortunately, the attempt was largely unsuccessful. The WaPo’s Aaron Davis describes what ensued as “one of the most violent scenes ever caught on camera. Thousands of mostly peaceful protesters were pushed, gassed and shot at.” One of the most violent scenes ever caught on camera? These reporters have presumably been covering wars and genocides throughout their “journalism” careers and this was one of the most violent scenes they’d ever caught on camera? The first violent scene to come to mind is 9/11, you know, the day that ‘some people did something.’ But we needn’t go back quite that far. The peaceful protests of the last two weeks have provided a never-ending parade of violent images. Here are ten events from the last two weeks that are far more violent than watching protestors who refused to leave an area when asked, being cleared by police. We live in an age of symbols.

        "articles": "According to Rosie Gray of Buzzfeed, there are rumblings in the world of Ted Cruz where he may rescind his endorsement of Donald Trump. (UPDATE: Confirmation.) As has been the case a number of times with Senator Cruz, going back to last year, his timing couldn’t be any worse. Pulling his endorsement would come just over two weeks after he endorsed Trump. That followed two months of chest beating by the most fervent Cruz supporters replaying his convention speech over and over again when Cruz did not endorse and implored others to “vote their conscience.” That Cruz has to consider whether or not he’s taking back his endorsement merely reveals what many of us have suspected about him for some time: He’s as much of a politician as anybody else. Why does anybody need to contemplate whether or not to rescind an endorsement unless there is some kind of determination as to the political fallout or benefits? This is not the start. Cruz had no end-game when he started the fight over Obamacare that led to a short-term government shutdown. Many people exaggerated the effects both positive and negative but the bottom line is, Cruz didn’t need an end-game. He was fighting, remember? Cruz’s embrace of Trump in 2015 was another political calculation and one that backfired, badly. Cruz, like everybody else, assumed Trump wouldn’t even make it to Iowa, let alone become the nominee. Cruz was so confident of this, at the end of December he was predicting the primary race would be over by March. Of course that didn’t happen and Cruz was embarrassed by Trump in the south where Cruz was sure he had built what his campaign called the “southern firewall.” When Cruz had to drop out of the race, he didn’t endorse Trump. Then came the convention speech. Convention delegates and GOP party people in Texas were livid Cruz didn’t endorse. Cruz’s base of support however, was ecstatic. Politics eventually won out over principle. Cruz, knowing he needed support in Texas for his 2018 re-election bid and no primary challenger, issued the endorsement for Donald Trump. Trump people were happy and most Cruz supporters were ok with the decision as well. But they didn’t know this was going to happen and neither did Cruz. Now he has a serious problem. The longer he waits to rescind his endorsement, the worse it looks. If he rescinds, people will ask, “So you endorsed after he attacked your wife and father but this was a bridge too far?” That is Cruz’s quandary. One he wouldn’t find himself in if he hadn’t beaten the drum of purity since his election in 2012. Cruz is a politician. And he’s going to make political decisions. ",

He will tolerate that. But, he absolutely will not tolerate attacks on his person. He can make those attacks, but you cannot make them of him. You cannot make fun of his short, stubby fingers. You cannot impugn his wealth. You cannot talk about his marriages or his family life. This does not just apply to him, but to his followers.

Either Biden is completely oblivious to what’s actually going on and being done or he’s just plagiarizing the idea, pretending it’s his own and lying about Trump. Take your pick. Either way, it shows he not right for the job he seeks. It also highlights how much Trump is actually doing on about the pandemic that doesn’t get the media attention that maybe it should. Maybe Biden doesn’t know about it because it’s not covered by CNN or MSNBC. Biden of course has a past history of lying and plagiarism which caused him to have to have to drop out of the 1988 race, his first run for the presidency, when he was busted for lying about his academic record and swiping parts of speeches without attribution, among other issues.

        "articles": "One of the most common things you hear from a Trump fanatic is that the single most important thing this election is illegal immigration and that Donald Trump is the only candidate who is talking about building a wall and deporting everyone that’s here illegally. Trump has claimed that no one would be talking about illegal immigration had he not brought it up, which is of course complete nonsense. Even his own talking points dispute that. Trump has repeatedly referenced the ominous “Gang of 8” as a way of attacking Senator Marco Rubio’s record since the proposed bill would’ve offered a path to citizenship for the illegals The Donald promises to kick out. The Gang of 8 bill was proposed in 2013 so if nothing else, we know immigration was a discussion 3 years ago. Putting aside the fact that Donald proposes roughly the same wall that was already put forth in the Gang of 8 bill (roughly 1,000 miles), why hasn’t anyone asked Mr. Trump why he sent so much money to the group? The Gang of 8 is comprised of (obviously) 8 senators. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-CO Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-IL Sen. Jeff Flake, R-AZ Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC Sen. John McCain, R-AZ Sen. Bob Menendez, D-NJ Sen. Marco Rubio, R-FL Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY Of those 8 members, Donald has contributed money to five. 3 Democrats(!) and 2 Republicans. They were Schumer (5 times!), Durbin, Graham, McCain & Menendez. And what did Trump expect to get for his money? Because don’t forget, it was Trump that said he put money into candidates so he could get what he wanted. It was Trump that said he was part of the problem. His donation to Graham was in 2014, a year AFTER the Gang of 8 bill was proposed, so I guess he felt he got his money’s worth. Did he change his mind since he made these donations? Always possible. This is a guy whose entire persona is wrapped up in changing his mind on a whim. I wonder if it was around the same time he changed his mind on the idea that Romney lost the election because he was too hard on illegal immigration? But back to the point, what credibility does Donald Trump have to criticize Rubio’s membership in the Gang of 8? He was the Charlie to Graham’s Jill Munroe. The Soros to Durbin’s Media Matters. The financier. The puppeteer. He’s the one that says his money purchased his power. What hath is power wrought? Support for what he now refers to as an amnesty bill i suppose. He claims to be a chameleon. In actuality he’s hiding in plain sight. Follow @BenHowe ",

        "articles": "Saying that “Everybody needs to take a deep breath, respect one another”, John Kasich announced today that states don’t need laws protecting children and ladies from transgenders going into the wrong restrooms, and that he wouldn’t sign such a law as Governor. Going with the “Can’t we all just get along” line, Kasich continued his week-long pandering to feminazi’s and gender extremists in a bid to out-flank Trump to the left and steal some of New York’s extreme liberal voters: “I wouldn’t have signed that law from everything I know; I haven’t studied it,” the GOP presidential candidate added. “You just got to see what the laws are and what the proposals are and why you need to write a law. Why do we have to write a law every time we turn around in this country? Can’t we figure out just how to get along a little bit better and respect one another? I mean, that’s where I think we ought to be. Everybody chill out.” Allowing that some religious institutions should have some kind of vague protections, the Ohio governor worried about how “tricky” it is to tell a grown man “NO” when he tries to follow a group of little girls into the lady’s room: “But when you get beyond that, it gets to be a tricky issue,” he added. “And ‘tricky’ is not the right word, but it can become a contentious issue.” “Tricky” and “contentious”. Two words that don’t come to mind for me when discussing the “rights” of grown men to go into the little girl’s room. Interesting that Kasich is running on the idea that he has “executive experience” and can make the “tough decisions”, while complaining that Cruz has never “accomplished anything”. I don’t think there would be anything “tricky” for Senator Cruz when asked to sign a law saying grown men shouldn’t be creeping into girl’s restrooms. ",

        "articles": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questions Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire,as he testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questions Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire,as he testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) As Republican Congressmen tried valiantly to push Lt. Col. Mr. Vindman into divulging the name of the whistleblower, alleged to be Eric Ciaramella, Adam Schiff was repeatedly forced to interrupt with his now familiar warning. It’s remarkable how frequently and easily lies slip off this man’s tongue. He shuts down all emotion and like a preprogrammed robot, and one can almost see it happening, he delivers his lies. That said, Schiff is not an especially effective liar. A convincing liar has to use a certain amount of emotion to be believed. My guess is that even his fellow Democrats know he’s lying, but because they share the same goal which is to destroy Trump, they’re happy to go along with it. On Tuesday night, Newt Gingrich joined Fox News’ Laura Ingraham to discuss the hearings and they discussed – well – what a liar Schiff is. Here’s Newt: My first thought is very simple, Schiff’s a liar. If Schiff doesn’t know who the whistle-blower is, why is he cutting off questions about a person he doesn’t know exists? I think it’s hard to exaggerate to the American people the degree to which Adam Schiff is a liar. And a liar on a scale that frankly totally dishonors the U.S. Congress. I mean, his whole — first of all, there is no whistle-blower. There’s no whistle-blowing statute for what happened. What you have is a leaker. The leaker was leaking things that are classified. He has no right to protection. Schiff clearly knows who he is and has lied to the country. I used to be pretty aggressive when I was in Congress. I am surprised one of the members of the House Republicans doesn’t just say, ‘We all know the whistleblower is X. Now if you know it’s not X, who is it?’ Now, Schiff would then say ‘Oh, my God, we’re going to file an ethics complaint.’ In the video below, Vindman tells Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) he told two individuals about the Trump/Zelensky call and says one was George Kent. Nunes tries to zero in on the second person and asks Vindman “What agency is this individual from?” Schiff immediately pounces. “If I could interject here. We need to protect the whistleblower.” In the second video below (at 3:55), Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) questions Vindman. “And you’re not willing to tell us who that other individual is?” Schiff springs into action. “As I indicated before, this committee will not be used to out the whistleblower. The same necessity to protect the whistleblower will persist. You will be recognized again Mr. Jordan.” The scene appears to me at least, as a group of children who are playing “court” and Schiff is the obnoxious older brother who “calls being the judge.” He also gets to make up all the rules. One of those rules is that the whistleblower has the “statutory right” to anonymity. A fact check by the Washington Post indicates this is a false claim. Neither the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) nor any related statutes have language guaranteeing anonymity for whistleblowers. These laws, in conjunction with Presidential Policy Directive 19 and Intelligence Community Directive 120, provide protections from work-related retaliation. Intelligence community whistleblowers can’t be demoted, fired or reassigned for legally reporting their concerns; their pay can’t be cut; they can’t be sent in for psychiatric exams; and their security clearance level can’t be touched. “Nothing in the ICWPA expressly protects the anonymity of a complainant, or provides sanctions for someone who discloses it,” Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law and an expert on national security law, previously told The Fact Checker. “I think the harder question is whether disclosing a whistleblower’s identity could run afoul of other statutes, such as the federal criminal laws barring efforts to intimidate witnesses.” Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst at the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, said the ICWPA “implies anonymity as a shield from other forms of workplace retaliation.” “While not explicit in the statute, the obvious intent of the ICWPA was to create a channel through which intelligence employees could make disclosures of urgent concerns internally, securely, and anonymously (if they so choose),” McCullough wrote in an email. “That’s reinforced by the committee report’s recognition that whistleblowers could seek anonymous guidance from their home agency when making whistleblowing disclosures. The lack of whistleblowers’ right to enforce their confidentiality may be a loophole that Congress should correct.” … Federal law expressly restricts the inspector general’s office from disclosing whistleblowers’ identities. It says “the Inspector General shall not disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee, unless the Inspector General determines that such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation or the disclosure is made to an official of the Department of Justice responsible for determining whether a prosecution should be undertaken.” That appears to be the lone statutory restriction on disclosing a whistleblower’s identity, applicable only to the inspector general’s office. We found no court rulings on whether whistleblowers have a right to anonymity under the ICWPA or related statutes. Another lie brought to us from Adam Schiff. That this serial liar is allowed to drag the nation through this sham of an investigation is a travesty. Watch the video. (The Gingrich segment starts at 22:05, the discussion about Schiff’s lying begins at 26:55.)  The relevant portion in the video below begins at 3:50.

Tomorrow, I’m going to vote for Marco Rubio, or if the polling average corrects slightly, Ted Cruz. I will do this despite enormous reservations about both men. (See below for more.) I will do this despite the fact that neither is even my third choice. I will do this because forcing Trump to go to the convention is more important than my ego. You must, too. I do not care if the first thing you do when you wake up is to mutter or yell, “GANG OF EIGHT.” I do not care if you think Ted Cruz took us to a dangerous precipice for his own career advancement in 2013. I don’t care about which one lied about what or who or whatever during a campaign. You must not, either. Tomorrow, Donald Trump is going to win every state except possibly Texas. Maybe. But the story on leaving tomorrow must be, “TRUMP’S MOMENTUM BLUNTED.” The message for everyone paying close attention must be, “TRUMP WITHOUT NEARLY ENOUGH DELEGATES TO GET THE NOMINATION AND IT AIN’T GETTING BETTER.” At this point, Cruz fans will say that Rubio hasn’t won a primary and won’t win Texas so why are you so pro-Rubio? Rubio fans will note that Cruz is fading and there isn’t another Iowa or Texas coming, so get on board, Cruz-lover. To both camps: Put on your big-boy pants and stop squabbling like infants. This is no longer about either man winning outright or either man being the anti-Trump. One or both must be so long as Trump is slowed. He lives off of the perception of invincibility, and if you crack that — as we saw last week — he shows how weak and defensive he is. Right now, Republicans nationally are starting to coalesce around what they see as the strong horse. We must show them that the strong horse is actually headed for the glue factory by the fall. If you live in a state where your first choice is running first or second, bully for you and I’m serious. Run with it. But if not, vote for the other guy. This is infinitely more important than your own precious ego or preferences. Our movement, our party, and our nation are at stake. Grow up, stop telling us who started it, and be the responsible adults the Founders somewhat ridiculously imagined would be running the show even now. FULL DISCLOSURE TIME: I don’t yell “GANG OF EIGHT” because I’m a non-moron, but Rubio’s decision to back and push it was dumb dumb dumb. It was not a lie; that’s the dumbest thing Cruz supporters and Trump’s merry band of morons say. It was awful political judgment, reinforced by the ridiculous 2012 postmortem from the GOP, and a sign that Rubio’s principles can be overridden by advisers. He shouldn’t apologize for the bill, he should apologize for the absolute lack of judgment about his party’s needs on the eve of vital midterms it showed. I have grave concerns about what a President Rubio would be, but I know exactly what a disaster a President Trump would be. As for Cruz: His foreign policy is that America should not involve itself in every war, but should only involve itself where its interests lie. This is also, wisely, Israel’s policy. I mention this because in 2014, while Christians being hunted by ISIS gathered in Washington to try to build support for Western intervention, Ted Cruz popped in to chide them for supporting Hezbollah (at war on the edges with ISIS) and not with Israel (openly saying, “Let’s you and him fight.”). He essentially chided them for not loving Israel more than themselves. When publicly called out for this, his response was to apologize to his critics for suggesting they didn’t care enough about Middle Eastern Christians, which is kind of like apologizing to a man for chipping his mother’s precious cutlery while sawing off her head. This, to me, showed an incredibly skewed set of priorities: America won’t help those Christians (who are icky and use altars and believe Christ is present in some bread), but they’d better get right with Israel or it gets worse. As a Christian, this moved him to the bottom of the non-Trump and non-Kasich pile; but even so, I’ll hold my nose and vote for the unctuous little hobbit because as bad as this is, Trump might bomb those same Christians if they won’t agree to build one of his new casinos there. Finally, I know whereof I speak when I tell you to vote for someone you don’t like in a primary: I voted Perry in 2012 and was going to do so this year even though he was out by the time my state came/comes around. Historically, I vote for the Republican who can get elected and be conservative there. This year, I’m voting to stop a psychopath, and then I’ll be nauseous after. ",

You were a media darling back in 2013 when you overwhelmingly won re-election against a joke of a candidate in my former corrupt home state. That’s terrific. But you convinced yourself you could parlay that into a successful presidential run and you badly miscalculated. I wrote back in June of 2013 why you wouldn’t win the GOP nomination. Let’s face it. You’re essentially Mitt Romney with a bigger mouth. You embraced Obamacare with your Medicaid expansion. You support Common Core. Your record on the second amendment is a disgrace. You’re a big government conservative. You’re also a petulant person who it seems is always concerned more about your own interests than the interests of the GOP and conservatives and therefore, the country. As long as the media is happy with you, you don’t care about any damage you might have been doing to the conservative movement. After being humiliated in Iowa, you decided your best course of action was to go after, not Donald Trump (or even Ted Cruz) but Marco Rubio. The very same guy you mocked because he “beat Ben Carson.” That was hilarious considering you finished tenth. Who did you beat? Rick Santorum, Jim Gilmore and Other. Congratulations. Then came the debate, Mr. Former Federal Prosecutor. And you had your moment. You threw Marco Rubio off his game for several minutes and for you, that was your “victory.” Your idiotic “self defense” reasoning on abortion was laughable and it’s part of the reason why conservatives have rejected you. Yet, because of that moment, the media started talking about a “comeback” and wondering if that moment would propel you beyond the gutter in New Hampshire despite the fact the amount of time you have spent there, has nearly made you a resident. Two days ago, because of what happened in the debate, you were saying, “My flight is booked for South Carolina.” Then you flopped. Badly. Again. You finished in sixth. Not only are your chances of winning in South Carolina have less a chance than a snowflake has on the surface of the sun, you didn’t even qualify to be on the debate stage this Saturday. I hope it was worth it. You had a chance to take on Donald Trump to the betterment of the party and the country and you didn’t. Because that didn’t serve you well. Maybe, if Trump gets the nomination, you’ll get that Attorney General post. Otherwise, I’d expect you’ll be in Trenton until your time is up in New Jersey. Good riddance, sir. ",

No one has been a bigger disappointment to Conservative Women than Ann Coulter. She was once looked at as being bold, brash and beautiful. Two decades of Political stardom later, Coulter now sounds more like the lonely, old woman who sells flowers on the corner. Just when it seemed the lanky blonde couldn’t sink any lower… she tweeted the following: If only people with at least 4 grandparents born in America were voting, Trump would win in a 50-state landslide. — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) November 8, 2016 This smacks of crazy talk, and a lot of people pointed out to her that it sounds like the Nuremberg race laws of Third Reich. Those also determined worthiness based on the grandparents. If this was an attempt at humor it failed. Based on the many responses on Twitter, not sure even her more forgiving fans were pleased with her words. I mean, c’mon. She’s practically quoting the Nazi handbook so she can insult immigrants of all backgrounds. Twitter was a buzz from the moment the tweet was published, as of this writing she has not deleted it. Nor do I expect her to, if she deletes it how will she continue to trend on Twitter this morning? For some reason I feel the need to point out that Ms. Coulter’s new rule would make her candidate, The Donald and all his children ineligible to even vote let alone run for office. His mother was an immigrant. This was obviously lost on Ann. Several of her defenders explained to me that what I read was not what she intended to “say”, that there was some secret meaning that would somehow make the insanely stupid words make sense. But upon further probing, I determined they didn’t actually know what she “meant” either. Nevertheless they were convinced that Coulter was just thinking on another level than everyone else. That’s certainly one way to put it. There is no decoder ring needed to determine Coulter’s motivation: money. She has become what she once claimed to hate. She seems unperturbed by this fact. Calling her a fame=whore feels like an insult to fame-whores; most won’t destroy their entire brand for someone else’s. Ann Coulter put out two books during this election cycle: “Adios, America” and “In Trump, We Trust”. The titles kind of give away the plot. Those projects and their ensuing revenue streams, clearly became more important to Ms Coulter than representing the values she’s espoused for years. Coulter is just one of many formerly trusted “Conservative” voices, that no longer speak for me, if they ever did. ",

        "articles": "The people of New Hampshire have a quaint self-delusion that they pick Presidents. In fact, they like to denigrate Iowa specifically by saying “Iowa picks corn, New Hampshire picks Presidents.” The actual truth is that New Hampshire has been on an unrelenting losing streak that goes back over three decades, for both parties. In every contested primary – Republican or Democrat – since 1992, New Hampshire has picked a candidate who either a) lost their party’s nomination or b) lost the general election. Let’s review the history. In 2012, the Democrats had an incumbent, but the Republicans had a hotly contested primary in New Hampshire. Mitt Romney won, but went on to lose the general election to Barack Obama. In 2008, both parties had a contested primary in New Hampshire. For the Democrats, New Hampshire chose Hillary, who would go on to lose her party’s nomination. For the Republicans, New Hampshire would pick John McCain, who would go on to lose in the general. In 2004, the Republicans had an incumbent, but the Democrats had a contested primary, which John Kerry won. That led him to the Democratic nomination, whereupon he lost in the general to George W. Bush. In 2000, both races were contested again, and for the Republicans, New Hampshire picked John McCain, who would go on to lose his party’s nomination to George W. Bush. For the Democrats, New Hampshire (barely) picked Al Gore, who would go on to lose to Bush in the general. In 1996, the Democrats had an incumbent, but the Republicans had a contested primary, which was won (astonishingly) by Pat Buchanan. Quite frankly, when this happened, we ought to have just banned the state of New Hampshire from voting altogether, or at least removed them from being one of the earliest contests, but we are not an especially smart party when it comes to politics. I think it should go without saying that Buchanan did not win the Republican nomination or the Presidency. In 1992 the Republicans had an incumbent, but the Democrats had a contested primary, which was won by Paul Tsongas. Tsongas would go on to lose to Bill Clinton in his party’s nomination. In 1988, the Democrats had a contested primary in New Hampshire, which was won by Michael Dukakis. He would go on to win his party’s nomination, but lose the general election. For the Republicans, New Hampshire picked George H. W. Bush, which would count as their only win in the last 30 years, except that Bush was basically an incumbent, as the sitting Vice President for a popular outgoing two term President. In 1984, the Republicans had an incumbent, but the Democrats had a contested primary, which was won by Gary Hart. Hart would go on to lose the nomination to Walter Mondale, who would himself lose to Reagan in historic fashion. Which brings us back to 1980, the one and only time a true first term President was catapulted to the Presidency by winning New Hampshire, when Reagan cleaned George H. W. Bush’s clock. What this history means is that New Hampshire has a 32-year uninterrupted history of picking losers in genuinely contested primaries. Based on the results last night, it looks like that streak will be extended to 36 years. Bernie Sanders has no shot at beating Hillary. If Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, he has no shot at beating Hillary either. People like to kvetch about Iowa’s involvement in the process, but Iowa has a positively stellar record by comparison, having catapulted Barack Obama (2008) and George W. Bush (2000) to the Presidency. Maybe it’s time to talk about moving New Hampshire back in the calendar some. ",

The Real Clear Politics average for Florida Republican Presidential Primary has Trump leading by 18.3 points. I’m more concerned that Rubio planning to continue campaigning in Arizona and Utah regardless of the Florida outcome. It just isn’t any longer feasible for Rubio to win the delegates required to secure the nomination. All he or Kasich can manage to do now is to become an effective spoiler for Sen.

I like Huckabee. I’ve met him a couple of times, and found him to be genuine, humble, and compassionate. These are great qualities for a former pastor-turned-politician.

This campaign is down to 4 candidates, and will end up between Sen. Ted Cruz and [mc_name name=’Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)’ chamber=’senate’ mcid=’R000595′ ], just like the pundits say. Selecting a candidate is like holding an iPhone for the first time, or deciding to see a movie from the trailers. It’s a feel-thing. Either you “get it” or you don’t. I remember reading one Mel Brooks movie review in the Boston Globe years ago that went something like “I hate Mel Brooks and everything he’s ever made. F.” This is how CBS, NBC and ABC (along with Maureen Dowd and the rest of the New York Times editorial writers) see every Republican candidate. Counting on the mainstream media to choose a Republican candidate will yield the worst dog possible—or Mitt Romney. Pundits are better than the media at predicting, but there’s pundits and there’s puppets. Anyone in the vast orbit of Karl Rove is going to push for the Windows Phone of candidates in an iPhone race like Jeb Bush or Chris Christie. And forget about Ann Coulter, who—if she were ever married—would leave her husband to become Donald Trump’s concubine. But there’s a class of pundit, and a few honest press brokers who see the world like “normal people” and they get it. The race for the nomination is truly narrowing, with a gaggle of ghost candidates waiting for Cole Sear to release them from this world, and a few others on life-support until the money’s gone. This election is essentially down to four candidates, and if you don’t know that, you’re probably whistling past the graveyard or wearing rubber bullets in your ears. That doesn’t mean Carly Fiorina, or Bobby Jindal, or Jefferson Sherman aren’t good people. It just means they won’t be the nominee this year. They’re past the event horizon of the black hole of politics. They’re demised, passed on, no more, expired and gone: they’re ex-candidates. In the view of the majority of useful pundits who get it, the final four are: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Rubio, and Cruz. We can’t ignore the fact that Carson and Trump are in a virtual tie for frontrunner, with Trump beginning a long slide, and the left focusing its big guns on exposing every piece of dirt they can find on Carson. Cruz has held steady at around 9 percent for a while, with a war chest of $13.5 million at the last FEC reporting milestone. More importantly, Cruz has a well-oiled campaign machine with serious horsepower. “People are swayed by his intellect,” said Mica Mosbacher, a Houston fundraiser helping organize events for Cruz across the country. “He always says, ‘Ask me all the hard questions.’ And he is very polite and humble. I think the firebrand you see [in public] is his passion getting ahead of him. Those who are supporting him admire that he will stand up for what’s right.” A Republican strategist well connected to the donor world added: “When he’s with major donors, they expect the guy they see with all the red meat, but they instead see an intelligent, buttoned-down lawyer with real bona fides. He will say things like, basically, ‘This is politics — you’ve got go out there and sell and perform.’ ” Cruz has the gravitas and intellect of a Jeb Bush, without the wishy-washy, kowtowing to money problems Bush carries. And of course, he doesn’t have the Bush name bolted to him like like a boat anchor. Cruz is also popular with evangelicals, being the real thing, and with hold-the-line conservatives, being the real thing. Evangelical author and radio host Dr. Michael Brown recently endorsed Cruz, writing, But in looking for the leader who most strongly fits my criteria – being unshakably pro-life, pro-marriage, and pro-Israel; having a good handle on economic issues, immigration, and national security; and not being part of the political establishment – [mc_name name=’Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)’ chamber=’senate’ mcid=’C001098′ ] comes out on top, and I genuinely believe he has a real possibility of making it all the way. Rubio is moving up fast in the polls recently, bolstered by a stellar debate performance sealing Bush’s has-been status. However, he lacks the organization and fundraising capacity of the other three candidates. Carson raised more than three times Rubio’s haul in the third quarter this year, which will hurt him when actual voting starts in a few months. Rubio communicates effectively with the electorate, and his financial prospects could improve should he have another great debate performance. Both Cruz and Rubio are running marathons, while Carson and Trump are sprinting. Like Herman Cain in 2012, who in 2014 said “I believed that I could win, and damn near did!” someone like Carson, appearing to be an unstoppable force, may not make it past Iowa. People like and “vote” in phone polls for Carson because they believe him, and all it takes is one true piece of dirt to erode that trust—just like Cain. Trump’s skeletons, on the other hand, are all out for public display. There’s nothing anyone could say about Trump’s past that likely hasn’t been said or played on cable 500 times. It’s Trump’s ability to sell himself on policy that may—the pundits say inevitably will—do him in. It’s possible that CNBC’s John Harwood did more damage to Trump than it seems when he began the last debate asking if Trump’s policies make him a cartoon character. Asked about being a cartoon, Trump becomes a cartoon character. #CNBCGOPDebate GOP debate — Eric Culp (@rewritersblock) October 29, 2015 The question was troll bait, but it had more than a tinge of truth to it. Does Trump really believe that he can solve the border crisis, the trade imbalance, the national debt crisis, our foreign policy malaise, and bloated federal government by just sinking his posterior into the Oval Office’s overstuffed chair? Will the “great people” he hires be able to get his plans through Congress? Do we really believe it? When voters start asking themselves those questions, as much as we may believe that Trump believes he can do all this, nobody should get a pass to be so light on details and heavy on their own ego. Trump the man on stage—the persona—is such a familiar role to him, who by all accounts is a nice guy in person, that it will likely be his undoing. In order to assuage concerns that he really is the narcissistic jerk he portrays, Trump has toned things down a bit, assuming what I think may be closer to his own personality versus his public persona. But it’s the persona that got all the media attention, and befuddled the pundits while rocketing him to the top of the polls. Now that Trump is sharing top-billing, and even a bit behind Carson, he can’t claim victory merely because he’s the victor in polls. Just how well Trump’s triumphant shtick will work when delivered from anything other than the pole position is unclear. There is a good reason that both he and his supporters have elected to rest their case upon a tautology — “He’s winning because he’s winning!” — and that is that, in a culture that celebrates champions, standing in first place is quite the aphrodisiac. Unsure about the Donald’s positions on matters of state? Worry not: He’ll make America great again because he is great; he’ll choose the best people because he is the best people; and have you noticed how rich he is? In the end, the pundits are right. It’s going to be down to Cruz and Rubio. There’s a reason why dark-horse first-time politicians lose. There’s a reason why red-hot social media campaigns fizzle. I have seen it personally. I’ve worked a local race where the dark horse (on his second try, after barely missing the first time) won the social media “likes,” raised the most money, offered the most detailed policy proposals, and had some of the best name recognition. And he lost—badly. The political consultant we hired to advise us told us how to win, and the candidate thought he knew better. The pundits know some things, and in the 2016 GOP race, we better listen if we want to take the White House. (crossposted from sgberman.com) ",

You know, he’ll build a giant wall, and then a giant trebuchet that will catapult all the Mexicans who are currently here over that wall, and then a giant moat and fill it with giant alligators. Meanwhile everything in Dearborn, Michigan is cool, no further action needed. Anyway, if those people have been paying even 10% attention throughout the course of the campaign, Trump has already walked back pretty much 100% of what he said about immigration that they initially liked. For God’s sake, three weeks ago he criticized Obama for deporting too many people! However, with Trump (reportedly) having settled on Mike Pence for his VP, these folks have finally figured out that they’ve been UNEXPECTEDLY BETRAYED and… well, the schadenfreude is delicious: Withholding comment until it’s official, but if claims about Pence as VP are correct, boy was I right about this being Trump’s first mistake — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) July 14, 2016 Pence Amnesty Scam: 3 years of UNLIMITED guest worker immig.

I don’t know, I can’t pretend to fathom the denuded thought processes of anyone who thinks Donald Trump would actually be a good President. These people have spent the whole primary season believing that Trump might betray everyone else and everything the Republican party stood for, but surely he wouldn’t betray them – even in spite of loads of evidence that he already had.

        "articles": "At the end of my recent post on the California laws the jury applied in the Kate Steinle murder case, I noted this observation by Andrew C. McCarthy: It is a federal felony, up to 10 yrs’ imprisonment, to be an illegal alien in possession of firearm (18 USC secs.922(g), 924). DOJ should indict Zarate if haven’t already. Sentence consecutive to today’s state gun conviction could keep him in prison 13 yrs or so. — Andy McCarthy (@AndrewCMcCarthy) December 1, 2017 McCarthy’s exact prediction has come to pass: A federal grand jury has indicted a Mexican man on immigration and weapons charges after he was acquitted of murder in the 2015 shooting death of Kathryn Steinle, the Justice Department said Tuesday. Each of the two new federal charges carries a maximum of 10 years in prison if Jose Ines Garcia Zarate is convicted, the government said. He was indicted on one count each of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition and being an illegally present alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition. Here is a screenshot from the indictment. Note that the statute, 18 U.S.C. 922(g), is the precise one mentioned by McCarthy: A federal grand jury indicted Jose Inez Garcia-Zarate for being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition and for being \"an illegally present alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition,\" according to announcement from the Justice Department. pic.twitter.com/aLjUannlpO — NBC News (@NBCNews) December 6, 2017 This is not double jeopardy, principally because the federal government is a separate sovereign, and double jeopardy applies only to charges from the same sovereign. Ken White of Popehat, a former federal prosecutor, routinely warns against putting any stock in news media statements about the amount of time a federal defendant is “facing.” Actual sentences are based on a complicated set of guidelines, taking into account a person’s record, their cooperation, remorse, and a host of other factors. So don’t get the idea that Zarate will necessarily get 10 years. Still, this is a positive development in an otherwise very sad saga. [Disclaimer] ",

        "articles": "Democratic Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson has strong words about those causing chaos at the Capitol. Guesting on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation Saturday, the politician claimed that, had a Capitol police officer not fired the shot which struck unarmed Ashli Babbitt (who later died), he and others would’ve been literally lynched. ‘Our first martyr.' How Ashli Babbit is being turned into a far-right recruiting tool  — TIME (@TIME) January 10, 2021 Speaking to host Al Sharpton, Hank indicated white supremacy is what it’s all about: “This is nothing but a race war that was about to be unleashed.” According to the congressman, what many are calling a murder stopped the siege: “Had it not been for the gunshot of the one shot fired by that plainclothes officer in the Speaker’s lobby right behind the House gallery…if those people had been able to get through, they would have had us who were in the gallery up on the third floor trapped.” An extraordinary interview by Reverend Al Sharpton with Hank Johnson, who describes how easily he could have been lynched by the Jan 6 mob, had the police officer not shot one of the intruders  — Roufa Therrien | She, Her | #TalkAboutXXY (@roufa_therrien) January 10, 2021 And what would’ve occurred? About that, Hank’s sure: “Reverend Al, when they…finally got us out of there, we walked past spread-eagled rioters on the floor at gunpoint by the Capitol Hill police officers as we went down the steps. They had us surrounded up there on the 3rd floor. And if that police officer had not fired and stopped the onslaught…in the Speaker’s lobby, they would’ve cut off our escape route. They would’ve had us upstairs, and I have no doubt that some of us who look like me would’ve been hanging from the railings of the 3rd floor, onto the House floor, swinging like…strange fruit. We would’ve been swinging from those railings.” “And I tell you, that’s how close it came,” he added. In response to Al asking how many congresspeople were there, Hank kept things clear: The breachers were in business to murder by rope. “[There were] somewhere between 30 and 40 (members of Congress). They could’ve had their pick of who they wanted to make an example of. And they came to the Capitol to do business. And the business that they were about was to lynch some people.” Hank said Sharpton knows how it goes: “They talk about Mike Pence, they talk about Nancy Pelosi, but you and I know, Reverend Al, that one of us would’ve been hanging with them.” Al’s aware: “Clearly, you don’t bring a noose and weapons if you didn’t mean business.” Hank’s not the only one to connect dots between the riot and racism. As I covered previously, Nancy Pelosi claims those in revolt chose their “whiteness over democracy.” And president-elect Joe Biden characterized the craze with a colorful tint: “You can’t tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn’t have been treated very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol. We all know that is true. And it is totally unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. The American people saw it in plain view.” As for Hank, he’s hit some headlines as of late. His comment on Guam has recently resurfaced: #FlashbackFriday 👉🏻 Democrat Congressman Hank Johnson feared the island of Guam would tip over if too many people were on one side. pic.twitter.com/TGKvC5uCfD — Cari Kelemen (@KelemenCari) August 11, 2017 And some have referenced a 2016 remark on Israel: “There has been a steady [stream], almost like termites can get into a residence and eat before you know that you’ve been eaten up, and you fall in on yourself, there has been settlement activity that has marched forward with impunity and at an ever-increasing rate, to the point where it has become alarming. The fact is the Israeli government, which is the most right-wing government ever to exist in the state of Israel in its history, the most right wing government, you got a guy like Trump who is now the minister of defense in Israel calling the shots on defense.” Critics found “termite” reminiscent of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan: Fox Soul channel has canceled a Fourth of July program featuring Louis Farrakhan after an outcry due to his notorious anti-Semitism: “He has called Jews ‘termites’ and the #LGBTQ+ community ‘degenerates.’ He deserves condemnation, not exposure.”  — Canary Mission (@canarymission) July 2, 2020 Amid the American discussion, there’s been plenty talk of pigment and parentage to go around. If the last 5 years is any indication, I’d say put away your innocence — plan on a 2021 that’s radically Rated-R.

        "articles": "The collapse of the Republican stronghold on Texas is on the minds of every Texan, but Texas Governor Greg Abbott has some info that might allay Republican fears. Texas has been a low-tax, low-regulation state for decades, and thanks to the Republican’s approach of small government, the cost of living has never been lower and the quality of life has never been higher. Major corporations have moved to the Lone Star State in droves in order to take advantage of the business-friendly atmosphere and, as a result, many workers from blue states have followed. This has lead to fears that Democrat voters will pollute Texas politics due to having learned nothing, leading the state to devolve into a purple or even blue state and becoming exactly what they fled. Abbott said that the number one question he gets from Texans is about whether or not these Californians coming here for jobs will regress the state into something that looks more like the overpriced and overregulated state of California. “I have great news for them,” said Abbott. “These relocations are not going to change the politics in Texas, and we have mathematical proof for it.” “Two years ago, I was on the same ballot that Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke were on the ballot,” said Abbott. “We did an exit poll asking people after they left the polls, did you vote for Ted Cruz or did you vote for Beto O’Rourke, and then we asked them ‘did you move California or are you a native-born Texan. The results of that poll showed that 58 percent of the people who moved from California voted for Ted Cruz.” “Interestingly, that almost identically matches a separate poll that was taken — also an exit poll from the same election — that showed that 57 percent of the people who moved from California voted for Ted Cruz and both of those polls matched a study that was done a couple of years before that that asked Californians who came to Texas ‘are you conservative or are you liberal?’ Fifty-seven percent of the people who moved from California said they were conservative, 27 percent of the people who moved from California said they were liberal,” added Abbott. Abbott said that the reason these numbers are what they are is that leftists who like the high taxes would stay in California while the low-tax atmosphere of Texas would be more attractive to conservatives. What’s more, CEOs have told Abbott that another reason they move to Texas is the lack of policing in the states they left. Carlson highlighted the vast cultural difference between the states as well, highlighting that Texas leans into the Christian religion while California leans more into social programming. He asked Abbott if he was concerned that this kind of prioritizing of values would be a concern. Abbott reiterated that he’s not worried because these Californians are conservatives who believe in God and, on top of that, guns, which they’re excited to get since they couldn’t get them in California. Carlson made it clear that he’s still very wary of the shift and noted that if Texas goes, the country is done. Texas has been increasing in population by leaps and bounds for years with most people relocating from heavily blue states such as New York and California. As of yet, the politics of Texas has largely remained the same making Abbott’s claims of Texas getting more conservatives than leftists seem true so far. However, this is unlikely to allay the fears of many Texans until proof can be seen that it will remain safe in the hands of Republicans in upcoming elections. The race between Cruz and O’Rourke was a lot closer than many Texans would like, spurring on worries that Texas is indeed turning purple. Time will tell, but hopefully Abbott’s predictions will be true. Senior Editor. Culture critic, and video creator. Good at bad photoshops. ",

We must listen to them about what they care about and give them a voice in our government. pic.twitter.com/buBBTj1MNc — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) August 24, 2017 It’s the kind of ooey, gooey, feel-good nonsense that liberals love to spout. Because everyone knows that a Democrat senator who tweets that children are our future is destined for great things. Why, she should be president for that kind of out of the box thinking! To gauge how feasible Kamala’s idea is, I went to my 10-year-old daughter and asked her what she would do if she had a voice in the government. Her answer? She’d make sure every family in America got a dog. And families who have a dog allergy would get some other kind of animal. Which is a superb and very sweet answer! It’s exactly what a child should answer. And can’t you just see Kamala Harris’ nod of approval? Giving people things, that’s exactly what the government should be doing! Liberals like to ignore a lot of biological truths, don’t they? Like the fact that a child cannot rationalize things and see future consequences because their prefrontal cortexes aren’t fully developed until around age 25. Remember this old saying (that is attributed to both Winston Churchill and Ted Nugent)? If you aren’t a liberal by age 20, you have no heart. If you are still a liberal by age 30, you have no brain. It’s completely legit. The science is settled. Then there’s the fact that children indeed have a say in government. It’s called voting, and every 18-year-old has the right and responsibility to do it (even while their prefrontal cortexes continue to develop). So there’s a reason children do not and should not participate actively in government. They, like Democrats, cannot see the longterm consequences of their actions. (Exhibit A: Obamacare.) If it feels right, it must be right. Right? And there’s a reason Democrats like Kamala Harris don’t occupy the White House and are in the minority in the Senate, the House, and a majority of governorships and state legislatures: Because they are utterly devoid of ideas. Quoting a Whitney Houston song is apparently all they’ve got in their arsenal. Bring on 2020. ",

        "articles": "There’s so much civil warring going on within the Democratic party that I can barely keep up. I’m actually getting tired of writing about it, but hey, the news is the news. In the wake of Rep. Ilhan Omar’s dismissive comments on 9/11, the response has perhaps been even worse. Omar herself has accused Republicans of inciting violence against her for simply quoting her verbatim. How that makes any sense is anyone’s guess, but it’s 2019 and this is the modern woke, liberal movement. Many other Democrats fell in line and rushed to her defense, including most of the 2020 hopefuls in what can only be described as a pathetic show of fealty. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, one of the “fresh faces” of the Democratic 2018 class took it a step further and decided to call everyone a racist. “Taking it out of context, this is just pure racist act by many of those—hateful acts by those because she does speak truth when it talks about different issues that they don’t disagree with. And I’m really outraged because as a person that has gotten direct death threats myself I know that her life is put in more danger.” Not content with just hitting at Trump and Republicans, Tlaib is apparently incensed that any Democrat would even passively suggest Omar could have handled the situation better. The Daily Wire has the story. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) lashed out at Democrats — not Republicans — yesterday, in the wake of criticism leveled at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) for minimizing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, accusing Dem leadership, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), of racism and using Congressional colleagues of color as “tokens of diversity.” Fox News reports that Tlaib “claimed in a Twitter message Saturday that she and other minority members of the party have been used as tokens whenever the party wants to project an image of inclusiveness.” Tlaib would go on to complain specifically about the Democratic party using her self-proclaimed “squad” in promotional campaigns while supposedly not giving them a seat at the table over policy. “They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse,” Tlaib wrote on social media. “However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored. To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us.” Tlaib also retweeted a post from Omar, essentially accusing Pelosi of the same, as well as a post from a “human rights activist” who doubled down. “More and more we’re realizing that POC [people of color] are used as props by @TheDemocrats,” Tlaib’s retweeted missive read. “When we run, we’re told to wait our turn. When we speak about our struggles, we’re told we’re angry. When we ask them to stand up for us, they say we’re being divisive.” Tlaib’s favorite game since getting elected is accusing anyone who disagrees with her as being discriminatory against “people of color.” She normally saves those volleys for the GOP but in this case, she’s training her fire at her own party leadership. I almost feel sorry for Nancy Pelosi having to put up with this but then I remember that she’s helped nurture this new woke left, so nah. Tlaib’s claims are nonsensical and come off like the whining of a spoiled child. Does she not realize that she’s just one of 435 members of the House? What makes her voice more worthy of a seat at the table that some no-name representative from Nebraska? Did she really think she could walk in as a 1st term Congressional member and start dictating policy direction? The mentality of entitlement that’s come along with the elections of Tlaib, Omar, and AOC is a sight to behold. These people really do think they are the most important voices in our government and in regards to the Democratic party, are they wrong? No, not really. They are controlling the messaging at least and Pelosi has no one to blame but herself for creating the mess she now finds herself in. I’ll note that despite all this infighting, the media seem to have no interest in actually reporting on it. Republicans can disagree about where to go for dinner and you’ll get dozens of “CIVIL WAR!!” headlines. Meanwhile, you’ve got Tlaib accusing Nancy Pelosi of racism and CNN is all “meh…” about it. Pelosi’s wing has already lost this battle. They just don’t realize it yet. Democrat politicians are terrified of ticking off their woke, inter-sectional base and the rabidness of said base is only growing more fierce. We see the kowtowing of the 2020 candidates, such as Beto going full beta male and apologizing for being white. Biden has done similar things. This is the new Democratic party and Tlaib, Omar, and AOC are running things. Pelosi and the rest of the leadership get to enjoy the monster they’ve created. Enjoying the read?

        "articles": "Right now, in the e-mails of many pundits, politicians, and strategists, a question is being asked: What the hell do we do now? Donald Trump won South Carolina by ten points over Marco Rubio and Rubio was only slightly over Ted Cruz. Jeb Bush has conceded that he has no path to victory. John Kasich wants to be Trump’s vice president. Ben Carson is still there and no one seems to know why. We’ve allowed this little experiment to go on long enough. It is clear that nearly 68% of Republican voters do not want Donald Trump, but that rhetoric simply won’t play because it doesn’t matter: The winner is the one who gets the most delegates. As long as the vote is split, Donald Trump can continue to win because one-third of the electorate can be for him while the other two-thirds is split 4-5 ways. It’s time to get serious. If the party is truly worried about Donald Trump, then it has to do something about it. That Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, the two most conservative men in this race, are attacking each other while a man who 1) supports Democrats 2) supports Democratic policies and 3) supports Planned Parenthood wins South Carolina’s evangelicals is not something we as conservatives (much less we as a party) should tolerate. I’m not egotistical enough to assume either Cruz or Rubio will read this, but if you gentlemen do: What the hell? Someone needs to pull Ben Carson aside (wake him up from whatever dream he’s having, first) and tell him, very forcefully, no, it’s not happening. You’re not happening. Stop trying to happen. Someone else needs to pull John Kasich aside and beat him about the head and shoulders with a stick. Toss both of them out of this race immediately, since they’re not mature enough to gracefully bow out themselves. As far as Cruz and Rubio are concerned, I get the strategy, I really do. Each of them are the other’s biggest threats in a world where Donald Trump isn’t the nominee. But that’s not guaranteed when Donald Trump is winning primaries. I say none of this as some sort of political strategist. I don’t say it as someone influential enough to make a difference in this race. I’m saying it as someone about ready to quit until the convention, if not longer, because we as a party have decided that we haven’t snatched defeat from the jaws of victory hard enough, and we want to give ultimate power in this country to either of a pair of raving, socialist lunatics. Why do we want this? Hell, I guess we are just so content with being an opposition party and whining, and we really don’t want to make a difference anymore. We just want to complain. It’s time to get serious if we want something good to come out of 2016, because right now we’re looking at one of three Democrats winning this race: Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump.

        "articles": "Because with great regulation comes great repressability, as the government is now cracking down on those little things in life that make it not so bad. One of those things is craft beers. The kind that hipsters and beer aficionados alike keep close to their hearts. But not only that, it’s a boon to our economy. As the Brewer’s Association tells us… “Small and independent American craft brewers contributed $55.7 billion to the U.S. economy in 2014. The figure is derived from the total impact of beer brewed by craft brewers as it moves through the three-tier system (breweries, wholesalers and retailers), as well as all non-beer products like food and merchandise that brewpub restaurants and brewery taprooms sell. The industry also provided more than 424,000 jobs, with more than 115,000 jobs directly at breweries and brewpubs, including serving staff at brewpubs.” So not only is beer good, it’s good for everyone, even if they don’t drink it. It generates billions for the economy, and creates jobs. It’s an awesome aspect of American life. So of course, government wants to ruin it. How? Well, some bureaucrats that will never meet you think that beer is making you too unhealthy because you’re unaware of how many calories are in it. So, utilizing the 3,000 page tome that is Obamacare, they’re going to regulate the craft beer industry into labeling every beer they make with the amount of calories it contains. Failure to do so means they can’t sell it in a restaurant chain with over 20 locations. Understand that this is really bad for most craft breweries, because the majority of them are small businesses, and moving to comply with these laws will cost them dearly. Americans for Tax Reform have weighed in. “The Cato Institute estimates the Obamacare calorie labeling requirements will cost a business as much as $77,000 to implement. For larger beer companies, this is a drop in the bucket, but for small, local craft brewers it represents a substantial cost that they must pay. As a result, it creates a significant disadvantage compared to larger beer companies who can better absorb the cost of this new regulation.” This means that the brewery will have to do a few things to make sure they’re all nice and legal. They’ll either have to lay off workers, increase the expense of their product, cut costs, or just shut down altogether. How many billions of dollars will this take out of our economy, and how many jobs will this cost if these small businesses are forced to to carry the weight of the government on their back? We’re about to find out, because this regulation hits this December. And all this for a primarily useless law. Only 16% of people actually care about the calorie count of their food, according to a study by Arizona State. So the tl;dr here is that some people in DC have decided to place regulations on businesses they’ll never go to, that will cost the jobs and livelihoods of people they’ll never meet, in order to see to the “health” of people who aren’t concerned. Today it’s just the breweries. Who will the politicians come for next in the interest of the public good? Senior Editor. Culture critic, and video creator. Good at bad photoshops. ",

        "articles": "If you want further proof that Democrats aren’t serious about their self-appointment as the voice of the people, then you need look no further than the sit-in (lovingly called the “pout-in”) that House Democrats began Wednesday. As it turns out, Democrats could have forced the vote that they claimed they so desperately wanted, but really, this wasn’t the aim at all. What they wanted was big, flashy, and cashy. From Politico: Hill Democrats had been itching for a political fight on guns since the Orlando shootings. In the Senate, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) last week had staged a successful filibuster that caught national attention and eventually led to a series of floor votes. Those measures failed, but there will be another vote on a proposal by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). House Democrats wanted to do something similar and had been brainstorming for days. There had been talk about trying a discharge petition — doing an end run on GOP leaders to force a vote — but they didn’t have the support and it would take too long. So they needed to come up with something bigger, something more catchy. And so they did. The Democrats popped a squat down on the literal House floor in a big, dramatic display of concern for the citizenry, and “common sense” measures on gun control. During this they would claim that the GOP was restricting the vote, when it was the Democrats themselves who were pulling strings by not filling out the necessary paperwork. But that’s not all. The only Democrats love more than attention is money, and if you’re good at something never do it for free. Fundraising emails were sent out by various representatives, and the DCCC that all centered around how much they needed your help in order to fight the Republican/NRA/pro-gun activist scourge that is killing our nation. Read one email… “This is an historically important moment! John Lewis has been leading a sit-in on the House floor for 11 long hours now. We’re fighting to prevent gun violence. The Republicans refuse to lift a finger. It’s shameful. I need your help to defeat them once and for all.” As Jay Caruso points out in his article, the DCCC has sent at least 8 fundraising emails since last night. The Democrats never really cared about the vote, because they didn’t force it like they could have. Their end goal was getting money from gullible people who really thought they were fighting the good fight, and sticking it to Republicans. Once again, concerns over the safety of the citizenry was never the concern. Only Louie Gohmert showed any inclination into talking about that. What this was, pure and simple, was a cash grab. The bottom line here is that they could have had a vote. They are protesting to get a vote they could have had just by doing the paperwork. Nothing stopped them from doing it. They CHOSE to do the sit-in instead. And of course we know why. You’re all being played. Senior Editor. Culture critic, and video creator. Good at bad photoshops. ",

        "articles": "I’m not sure why the left hasn’t thought through their current parading around of former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens New York Times article on repealing the 2nd Amendment. Just to get the obvious out of the way, repealing the 2nd isn’t just something that happens with the snap of a finger. First, you’d need a new amendment to replace the one you’re repealing, and that must be voted in by 2/3 of Congress. Then 3/4 of the states must approve the amendment. And that’s just the summarized version of events. Don’t even get me started about the wheeling, dealing, and stealing it would take to have an amendment passed. Especially if it’s an amendment to repeal something from the bill of rights. It’s safer to say that repealing anything from the bill of rights just isn’t happening. You can hardly get enough congressmen to agree on a small bill, much less get 38 states to agree to repeal one of the most beloved amendments. But let’s say that by some work of the devil himself, it did happen. Let’s say we repeal the 2nd Amendment and guns are banned. Nothing but unicorns and rainbows, right? You couldn’t be more wrong. Firstly, you didn’t ban guns from the United States. We’ve had so many in circulation for hundreds of years that you now have a massive stockpile of illegal weapons just sitting in people’s closets, drawers, etc. You can order that these guns be delivered to your nearest law enforcement agency, and in the interest of being law-abiding, I’m sure many firearms will find their way into the hands of the authorities. But then you’d have problems with people who refuse to give up their firearms. As far as many Americans are concerned, owning a firearm is a right with or without a constitutional amendment. Our guns will stay right where they are, if not just a little more out of sight. But the guns from the (previously) law-abiding aren’t necessarily the guns you have to worry about. In fact, they rarely were in the first place, but that’s another conversation. Repealing the right to own firearms in a country soaked to the brim with guns will only serve to create a black market. People will understand that weapons are now far more valuable than before, and will buy, trade, and sell weapons with zero oversight from the government. Some very well might end up in the hands of a good guy, who won’t use it for evil despite the illegality of the weapon. However, some criminals will continue to acquire these weapons for nefarious purposes. Not that they aren’t doing that already, but at least before we had good guys with guns to stop them. Repealing the 2nd just put those folks into hiding. So good luck, as the statistics show you just helped violence increase greatly. But now you’ve got a bigger problem on your hands. Aside from the open invitation to criminals to ride roughshod over the now disarmed American people, you’ve cracked a Pandora’s box of amendment repeal lunacy. I’d like to remind everyone that the First Amendment has never been less liked than it has been today. The very same youth many wish to give the vote because they hate the Second are also famous for hating the First. Polls have come out giving numbers as to how many millennials wish to repeal or restrict the First Amendment, but all of them are frightening. WaPo, for instance, found that 40 percent of millennials believe 1A shouldn’t protect “hate speech.” Keep in mind that much of what is considered “hate speech” nowadays is whatever hurts somebody’s feelings, which in effect could be anything at any time. By repealing the 2nd, you give rise to the idea that any amendment could, and should be repealed. There will be movements, and activists groups that pull out all the stops to repeal the First in the interest of a “more civil society” and “safety.” Politicians, in an effort to stay in power, will begin parading around the idea that they were always in favor of restricting 1A and will vote to make the United States a better place for everyone. Maybe not that year, or even the decade, but eventually the fall of the 2nd Amendment will lead to the fall of others. The First Amendment might go because being mean and offensive in this country only leads to conflict. The Fourth Amendment might go because we obviously have a lot more gun violence before, and searches and seizures should be carried out in order to make us safer. So on, and so on. Rest assured, the 2nd Amendment isn’t going anywhere. If it did, however, then the good intentions of the ignorant would land the country in a real bad way. Senior Editor.

        "articles": "Probably no one has earned more leeway from conservative voters and pundits than Rush Limbaugh. Rush has been a tireless force for the conservative movement for decades, and he probably is responsible for a whole lot of conservative Republicans who are currently in office. But thankfulness for past service only goes so far, and Rush’s program yesterday officially crossed the line. When I think about Rush’s last year or so on air, I’m reminded of Marshall Phillipe Petain, one of the most intriguing figures of the twentieth century. Without Petain, the French might not have prevailed over the Germans at Verdun, and thus might have lost World War I. But for as much thanks as France owed Petain for his service in World War I, the full historical reckoning for Petain must acknowledge that Petain was a Nazi collaborator, the leader of Vichy France, and a totalitarian dictator. Petain’s history is complicated, and to tell the whole tale honestly requires acknowledging both the good and the bad. So it is with Rush. For all he has done, and for all we should be thankful for, it is hard to deny that Donald Trump has brought conservatism to a critical moment. From this moment forward, it will either resemble the vision Rush has preached for thirty years, or it will not. It will either move forward as a recognizable force, or it will be destroyed with Trump in a historic landslide election. And Rush has chosen the wrong side, and is moreover taking a leadership position. Rush claims that he is neutral about Trump, and that he is just providing “analysis,” and not taking a side. However Rush might have clung to that fig leaf prior to yesterday, he can’t any longer. Here Rush is trying to spin Donald Trump’s insane behavior about what happened in Colorado as something positive for Trump. RUSH: Trump has this op-ed in the — this is gonna be tough when I get to that. Trump has an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. I have it in my formerly nicotine-stained fingers here. “On Saturday, April 9th,” Mr. Trump begins, in his op-ed in the Wall Street Journal today, “On Saturday, April 9, Colorado had an “election” without voters. Delegates were chosen on behalf of a presidential nominee, yet the people of Colorado were not able to cast their ballots to say which nominee they preferred. A planned vote had been canceled. And one million Republicans in Colorado were sidelined.” Now I hate to do this, but that just isn’t correct. There was never going to be an election, a primary election in Colorado and this op-ed gives the impression that Colorado was gonna have a vote. There was gonna be a primary and people are gonna vote like they have in other states and at the last-minute changed their mind. There never was a plan to vote. There was never a plan to vote that was canceled in Colorado. Colorado was always, from last August, going to be what it was: a series of conventions where delegates would be chosen to the convention by Republican attendance at these various county conventions and at the big state convention, but there was never gonna be a vote. Okay, got it? Rush starts off this bit by stating explicitly that Trump’s position is a bald-faced lie. And I don’t know why Rush “hate[s] to do this,” since all he is doing is stating a fact that is a matter of indisputable historical fact: Donald Trump is full of crap about Colorado. There is no reasonable dispute about this. Anyone with access to Google and 10 spare seconds on their hands could verify this. If Donald Trump really believes what he is saying, he is an idiot. The alternative is that he is a liar. Either way, what he is saying is false. Rush’s position is that Trump is a liar, and he thinks that is awesome (for Trump) and that it’s even more awesome that Trump lost. Seriously: And this op-ed — you know, I asked a question two days ago, and I asked it again yesterday. And that question was, why didn’t Trump call attention to Colorado not having an election beforehand? Why did he wait until Colorado’s process was complete to lodge a complaint about it? And this op-ed gives us the answer. You know what we have here? Trump andColorado is a classic lesson in winning by losing. How to win by losing. It is apparent to me now that the Trump campaign was fully aware that they were gonna lose Colorado this way and had found and discovered a way to turn that to their advantage by claiming that Colorado had cheated, by claiming that Colorado was disenfranchising people, by claiming that Colorado was gonna have a vote and then changed their mind. But their never was a plan to vote. So I’ve answered my question. Trump waited ’til after Colorado to exploit the fact that there was not an election there, and it helped his point if he lost. So for those of you devising campaign strategies in the future, file this one under the category of winning by losing. And even in the next page of the op-ed he refers to it again. He said: “No one forced anyone to cancel the vote in Colorado. Political insiders made a choice to cancel it. And it was the wrong choice.” There was no vote ever intended to happen. So there was never in this cycle a cancellation of an election. But Trump’s op-ed makes it look like there was a scheduled vote and a last minute cancellation to disenfranchise people because they didn’t want Trump to win. And Trump supporters are more than happy to embrace that. I mean, every supporter loves it when their guy is the victim of some cheating or some dirty trick. So I’ve answered my question. Why didn’t Trump call attention to this before they caucused in Colorado? Because he was counting on losing and then exploiting it, which he’s done brilliantly, and here you have this op-ed in the Wall Street Journal which carries the theme forward. Get it? Trump lost, on purpose, lied about how and why it happened, discredited the entire party in the process, and here Rush is calling him a genius and brilliant. For one thing, this is too cute by half. Know what Trump really needs more than to appeal to his (already dedicated) voters at this point? He needs 34 delegates. He’s tantalizingly close to being on pace for the 50% threshold (1,237) and losing all of the delegates from Colorado meaningfully hurt his chances. There’s no such thing as “winning by losing” – that’s just something losers say. Know who’s made that point countless times over the years? Rush Limbaugh. Second, no reasonable person would come up with such a convoluted reason to praise someone for telling a bald faced lie that hurts the political party they support – unless they are completely in the tank for someone. I’m serious. No one would look at a situation in which Trump lost in embarrassing fashion, then lied about why (in the process of whining like a baby) and say “Trump won this exchange” unless they were desperately looking for a reason to say Trump won. This kind of tortured and nonsense take has become all too common for Rush since he started running interference for Trump. And after yesterday’s show, there’s no other reasonable interpretation of the facts. In the existential fight for the future of conservatism, Trump has decisively sided with conservatism’s enemies. It’s very sad and depressing to watch, much like the grizzled men under Petain’s command who had survived the trenches of Verdun must have recoiled in horror to watch him palling around with Hitler. It’s most sad that when the final history of Rush is written, this sad chapter might well be the end. ",

        "articles": "Here’s a story for all you school board fans. On Tuesday, a father was turned down by the San Francisco Board of Education for a spot on his local Parent Advisory Council. That, despite his endorsement by sitting council members. A February 9th memorandum from the council to the board offered Part 1 of 2 in the alley-oop: The Parent Advisory Council respectfully requests the commissioners of the Board of Education to appoint one candidate recommended by the PAC for appointment, Seth Brenzel. His term would begin (retroactively) on February 1, 2021 and end on January 31, 2023. … PAC members discussed the candidate at the PAC’s regular meeting on February 2, 2021. The PAC voted unanimously to approve this candidate, and we present this recommendation to the Board of Education to approve and appoint this candidate to the PAC. There were four seats open, but he just couldn’t make it happen. Before Seth’s consideration, Commissioner Matt Alexander noted a concern. From the meeting’s transcript: “These spaces matter, and I think if we’re going to have a P.A.C., to me, that’s an intentional space. White parent(s) also in the city tend to have a lot of privilege and power and access the Board of [Education] in various ways. There’s various political ways and other ways that white parents access Board of [Education] all the time. In my view, if we’re going to have a space, we need to devote district staff and resources that (are) more focused on groups that are currently marginalized. Not creating space that overrepresent(s) white parents. I’m just really concerned about that, I guess. In terms of allocation of our resources of the public school district.” According to San Francisco Chronicle columnist Heather Knight, the race thing sank Seth’s battleship. “Their problem was that he’s white and doesn’t bring diversity to the group,” she wrote. The reported result: Zero men on the council. Color the meeting’s clerk unimpressed: “This is public shaming. It’s bullying behavior by people of power. Leaders of our community. Seth is one of the most caring people I know. He is a leader in our neighborhood community. He is a leader in his school community. Pto President. He is a leader of the city community. If you talk about presentation, you just talked about not being enough dads in the group. He is a gay father of — he has a mixed race family. I don’t know what more you need to just — he’s a good person. That’s all I have to say.” The SF school board tonight spent two hours talking about whether to allow a gay dad of mixed-race SFUSD kids to volunteer for one of several empty seats on a parent advisory group. Their problem was that he’s white and doesn’t bring diversity to the group. 1/2 — Heather Knight (@hknightsf) February 10, 2021 They didn’t appoint him, and now the parent group remains all moms which means women must do all the work of the group. And seven hours after the meeting started, they still aren’t talking about how to safely reopen schools. — Heather Knight (@hknightsf) February 10, 2021 School Board Vice President Alison Collins expressed a different kind of offense: “As a mixed-race person myself, I find it offensive when folks say that somebody is a parent of somebody who is a person of color as like a signifier that they’re qualified to represent that community.” In the end, they moved to wait for a final decision. And amid all that, the council chose to sock it to meritocracy. From The Daily Caller: The board ultimately moved to table the vote on Brenzel’s appointment until a more diverse group could be appointed to the Parent Advisory Council. It then voted to end the merit-based application process for Lowell High School, which the board assailed as creating “pervasive systemic racism.” San Fran education’s really on the ball where race is concerned. As previously covered by ’s Mike Miller, a teacher’s February 3rd op-ed in the Chronicle schooled readers on white privilege during the presidential inauguration: [A]cross all of our news and social media feeds, was Bernie: Bernie memes, Bernie sweatshirts, endless love for Bernie. I puzzled and fumed as an individual as I strove to be my best possible teacher. What did I see? What did I think my students should see? A wealthy, incredibly well-educated and -privileged white man, showing up for perhaps the most important ritual of the decade, in a puffy jacket and huge mittens. … “When you see privilege, you know it,” I’d told [students] weeks before. Yet, when they saw Sen. Bernie Sanders manifesting privilege, when seemingly no one else did, I struggled to explain that disparity. I am beyond puzzled as to why so many are loving the images of Bernie and his gloves. Sweet, yes, the gloves, knit by an educator. So “Bernie.” Not so sweet? The blindness I see, of so many (Bernie included), to the privileges Bernie represents. I don’t know many poor, or working class, or female, or struggling-to-be-taken-seriously folk who would show up at the inauguration of our 46th president dressed like Bernie. Unless those same folk had privilege. Which they don’t. Back to the school board, let’s hope they get it all figured out. And when Seth shows up for his second chance, a word of advice: Don’t wear mittens, Mr. Privileged. -ALEX See more pieces from me: To Be Inclusive of Non-Binary Parents, Hospitals Nix the Terms ‘Breast Milk’ and ‘Father’ 90-Year-Old Man Gets Sick of His Slow Internet Speed, so He Complains – in Front of the Whole Wide World A Woman of Faith Conquers the Coronavirus – at 116 Years Old Find all my  work here.

        "articles": "Today marks the 46th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, which signified the true end of the Vietnam War. Who could forget that famous picture of people queued up on a Saigon building (mistakenly thought to have been the US Embassy), getting on a UH-1 helicopter leaving Vietnam, as shown in this video: There were some other great pictures in that video, too. However, the real last helicopter flight out was that of a CH-46 (Callsign “Swift 22”). The video describes the helicopter evacuation operations that were part of Operation Frequent Wind, the largest such operation in history, which commenced on 25 April 1975: Commander Task Force 76 received the order to execute Operation Frequent Wind (initially Talon Vise), the evacuation of U.S. personnel and Vietnamese who might suffer as a result of their past service to the Allied effort. When the operation ceased on May 2, the Vietnamese Navy group set sail for reception centers in the Philippines and Guam in Operation New Life. Thus, this operation ended the U.S. Navy’s role in the 25-year American effort to aid the Republic of Vietnam in its desperate fight for survival. The non-Communist Vietnamese who escaped the country have long referred to April 1975 as “Black April.” Those who escaped to the US have become some of the most patriotic and anti-Communist of all Americans. Many of them, as well as their progeny, mark Black April on 30 April each year. Here is a typical comment from one person on the 40th anniversary that explains what Black April means: For Van Truong Le in Boston, this is a painful day, a time he and others who fled Vietnam call “Black April.” “Because that was when folks from South Vietnam lost our country to the North Communist regime,” he said. “It was the day we lost our country. So we refer to it as Black April 1975. In fact for the last 40 years on April 30, the Vietnamese who have resettled here for the most part commemorate and observe that day as a day to commemorate the loss of Vietnam.” And that name fits with good reason. Forced reeducation camps and a communization of the economy were in store for those who remained in Vietnam, as part of North Vietnam’s Communist takeover. Here is an excerpt of an account by Quyen Trong, who relates his father’s oral history: After the Fall of Saigon on April 30th, 1975, every South Vietnamese man, from former officers in the armed forces, to religious leaders, to employees of the Americans or the old government, were told to report to a re-education camp to “learn about the ways of the new government.” Many South Vietnamese men chose to flee on boats, but others had established lives and loved ones in Vietnam, so they willingly entered these camps in hopes of quickly reconciling with the new government and continuing their lives peacefully. According to my father, the government said re-education would only last for ten days, and at most two weeks. However, once there, the men were detained for many years in grueling labor camps. The time of imprisonment was physically demanding and morally disheartening. “The Communists put people like me into the jungle so that we would get sick and slowly die off. That was their goal… Everyone was miserable. Many people died of sadness… One week I’d see one gravesite. As the weeks went on I saw more and more graves.” Prisoners endured long days of menial labor and physical pain. “Everyday I needed to get 20kg of bamboo shoots. We had to peel the outside until we reached the soft white middle to collect. I worked in the jungle where there were leeches skinny as chopsticks. But once they stuck onto you and sucked on your blood, they would swell like fat sausages. I would lie there at night, tired and not knowing why, and my friends would see a big leech on my foot and pry it off.” Before the likes of the cancel culture rewrite the history of the Vietnam War, it is important to remember that US and South Vietnamese forces won virtually every major battle during the war, including the 1968 Tet Offensive, which wiped out the Viet Cong as an effective fighting force, but which the pro-Communist Walter Cronkite (and others) spun as a “strategic American defeat” to American television audiences. An excellent discussion of how Tet was falsely spun by the North Vietnamese Communists and their sycophants in the American media and anti-war movement (which was possibly the most successful information operation in history) can be found here entitled “Tet Declassified.” That Communist info op convinced Americans that the war was lost, which led to the “Vietnamization” of the war effort, to the Paris Peace Accords, to the American withdrawal from Vietnam, and ultimately to Operation Frequent Wind. Why was the war lost? A tragedy of bad decisions and strategic errors. That the US evolved ridiculous Rules of Engagement but no mission success criteria doomed the American effort to failure. Body counts, aircraft sorties and bombs dropped, artillery rounds fired, etc. The US “counterinsurgency strategy” was completely wrong, given the overwhelming military superiority of the US versus the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong. And LBJ’s management of the war effort from the Oval Office severely constrained commanders in the field. Allowing unfettered access by the American news media to unit-level operations was a strategic mistake, which led to the likes of Cronkite falsely spinning the reality on the ground to Americans watching the “television war.” By 1971 or 1972, the war was essentially won in South Vietnam, and after the Christmas bombing of Hanoi in December of 1972, North Vietnam’s will to continue had been broken. However, it was the Democrat majority in the US Congress who snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, and who deliberately forfeited the war after all US forces were withdrawn for US political reasons, as well as suspended military aid to the South Vietnamese. That latter perfidious act was the coup de grâce. Funny how nobody mentions that these days, as the DC Democrats push their Communist agenda down our throats. Some things never change. I have a number of good friends who are Vietnam veterans who served honorably, faithfully, and bravely during the war. A lot of them are Airedales (Navy-speak for naval aviators) who flew many combat missions. One was a POW in North Vietnam for over 6 years. They are all better men than I, and I salute their service and their personal sacrifices. As do I salute the honored dead who have been dissed by the Left for decades. [And then there’s the slime called Jane Fonda…] Even at their advanced ages, these men are ready to man the barricades in the event they are needed to defeat the domestic Communist threat to the United States that is plainly undermining the US Constitution and our constitutional Republic. Their patriotic service may still be required, and they know that there is no Operation Frequent Wind that will save their grandchildren if the US falls to communism. And the escapees from South Vietnam and other Communist countries now living in the US will be right there with them manning the barricades. Remember Black April! The end.

        "articles": "Mainstream media has taken a bruising from multiple fronts over the past few years. Some of the most trusted sources in the world of journalism have embarrassed themselves badly. Now the rise of fake news and the competitive nature of their business has turned the news industry into a joke. What happened? Even though the buzz about fake news is relatively recent, I saw it building up since the early days of election seasons in 2015. I have an unfair advantage, of course. Operating a conservative news aggregator forces me to read more in a single day than I did my entire 2nd semester in college. This gives me a bird’s eye view of the news as it’s disseminated to the web across hundreds of sources. It also makes me investigate individual stories before linking to them when they’re a little too fantastic. That’s been a regular occurrence since after the election. The most recent was yesterday when news started breaking that the Trump administration was shifting towards potentially opposing new settlements by Israel. This was a particularly difficult story to embrace because it was the type that mainstream media doesn’t want to follow. It sends them mixed signals. On one hand, it could be damaging to Trump to flip-flop. On the other hand, it hurt their own anti-Israel narrative that wants the Jewish state and the U.S. President aligned. If Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are in lockstep, the media can attack them both simultaneously. Two birds. One stone. Slowly, other publications started picking up the story, but I still waited until they pulled from more than the original source. That’s the sad nature of today’s media. Even “trusted” publications have been very wrong lately. There are many things that contribute to mainstream media’s failures, but three factors stick out: We’ll start with the most obvious. They didn’t just want Hillary Clinton to win the White House. They were downright certain it would happen. This was a double-whammy because both falacies made them doubt their own understanding of the world. As a result, many of them have become unhinged. They may not recover. After having their chosen one in office for eight years, their hated foe taking over is a shock to their system that could fundamentally change how they do their jobs going forward. It’s like they were in a warm, soothing shower relaxing comfortably until someone dumped a bucket of ice water on them unexpectedly. Trump’s victory was journalistic trauma. It’s not all their fault. A lot of the mistakes they make are based upon the unfortunate side-effects of a perpetually connected society. Between mobile phones, social media, blogs, alternative news sites, and every other form of media distribution that everyday people are using, mainstream media is under pressure to run with stories before they’re fully vetted. They were once able to take a story, test the ingredients, and bake it properly until it was ready to serve. Today, they’re forced to toss everything they have together in a bowl and throw it in the microwave. Clearly, product quality has been sacrificed for speed. This has another effect that isn’t quite as obvious. Because publications run with stories and feel justified to correct them later if they’re wrong, many publishers are using real-time demands and faulty sources in order to produce “excusable” fake news. As long as there’s some justification from another source, they’re okay with posting first and vetting later. Dozens of reports and commentaries can arise from a single reputable person Tweeting something. As long as a publication can report news, real or not, from behind the shield of a reliable public source, they no longer fear being called out for it. After all, they’re only reporting what others are already reporting. This more than anything else has given rise to fake news. Sadly, most mainstream media organizations are okay with this practice today. For better or for worse, Donald Trump has been able to manipulate the media. They may be hostile to him, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t use them as tools. While most are wondering how all of these transcripts and pieces of inside information are leaking out from within the Trump administration, some are starting to realize that the leaks are very likely intentional. This is an old practice, but the White House has never had a team so adept at it. Steve Bannon is where he is for a reason. While Trump leads the first violins, Bannon coordinates the second violins sitting behind them. He gets the right information out to the right people through a complex set of channels that keeps the media believing they are reporting against Trump when they’re actually doing exactly what he wants. It has been far from perfect. They did a great job during the campaign but they’re finding the old tactics must be improved upon for it to work the same type of magic from the Oval Office. The funny part is that the biggest flaw in their strategy is Trump’s Twitter account. If they could keep him from blowing it when the narrative is already on their side, they’d be better off. Mainstream media is facing an existential threat. They are losing more credibility every day while smaller publications are looking more and more like heroes. As they search for solutions to their many problems, they’ll someday come to the conclusion that they were their own worst enemy. Nobody can make the media look as bad as the media itself. ",

        "articles": "I remember growing up and wanting certain things at the mall or supermarket. From sugary cereals and handi-snacks to video games and action figures. I could never explain why I wanted those things, but alas, I would immediately know what I wanted the moment I was asked. Why would I ever want a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle action figure, let alone the whole set and the Turtle Van? Why would I want to eat Captain Crunch, which feels akin to jamming pieces of coral reef into the roof of my mouth? What the hell is appetizing about spreading “cheese-product” onto stale saltines, with a small, square, plastic stick? Though at the time I didn’t understand product marketing, now I do, and as a result, I can decode media influences when I see them. Often, commercials go right by me because I have learned to tune out the underlying message and simply be entertained by what happens in the commercial. What product it is or what they are selling flies right by me, and I remember the cute dog or the touching moment. In an effort, which I think began in the late 1970s to early 1980s, media companies began understanding how manufacturers were able to market their products to consumers and thought, hey, why can’t we do the same with an agenda? In the ironies of ironies, in 1984 of all years, the media’s first real push with their agenda-modeling actions was trying to convince a nation that Walter Mondale was the guy to elect as president. They failed miserably. They realized that if they tried to put us all in the boiling water, we will jump right out. They figured that, going forward, they were going to let us sit in the tepid water and then slowly turn the heat up. They knew the areas they had to change were where they could get the most bang for their Electoral buck: California and New York. Guess where the media also happens to almost operate exclusively? It also happens to directly correlate to the centers of the prominence of progressive policy. What do you know?! Since then, they have begun to gently turn up that heat to gently push the country further to the left. With the election of Bill Clinton, the media could finally celebrate, and that they did, which made them lazy. They fawned over our new Rockstar President so much that when they finally realized where they had let things get, we had all jumped out of the water in 1994 (handing Republicans Congress). The key issue of that was the emergence of media that they couldn’t control, that began questioning their agenda. That emergence was Rush Limbaugh. Rush was the guy, decoding for us the media agenda and yelling at us all to get out of the ever-heating water. While riding around in the front seat of my dad’s victory-red 1968 Bug, I remember being influenced by him explaining the complicated, in terms that even my then-eleven-year-old mind could comprehend. The media, instead of letting things get out of hand again and losing complete control, they painted their man, Bill Clinton, as the “moderator” and the guy who can bring everyone together. They made everyone love their cuddly teddy bear of Bill Clinton so much, that 1996 was a breeze. We loved Clinton so much, that even when the guy was convincing interns to service him in the Oval-Freakin’-Office, half the country still loved him. The media could not have been more thrilled with the result. They were going to keep that train going, by giving his smooth-talkin’, Global-Warmin’ preachin’ vice president, Al Gore, the keys to being the heir apparent. In fact, while they were at it, why not get to choose the Republican candidate as well? They ignited a race to the middle between George W. Bush and John McCain, so that worst-case scenario, they would end up with a moderate. To their shock and dismay, the 2000 Presidential race came down to four-hundred-something votes in Florida. They figured that instead of drawing the country to the left with the people picking the candidates, why doesn’t the media just choose the candidate and the people will follow? In light of 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they let 2004 go with nominating Lurch and Johnny “Cheat On His Cancer-Suffering Wife” Edwards, as they were their sacrifice to the long game. After 2004, the plan went into overdrive. In 2006, they were able to push for handing control of Congress to the Democrats, but it wasn’t the overall victory they were pushing for, rather the emergence of a person into the spotlight, that gave them all shivers up the leg: Barack Hussein Obama. OHHHH BOYYY. The media fawned over their new recruit, as they pointed out his qualities of being the progeny of some alternate world’s orgy between John F. Kennedy, William Jefferson Clinton, and Karl Marx. We were forced to hear of the graces of his multiple-memoired 40 years on this planet, having grown up in America to achieve what he had achieved, despite his skin-tone and that we, the American People, OWED him the pleasure of electing him President of the United States. If you didn’t accept that narrative, it was because you were a racist. For them, there was no middle ground. They knew they would eventually be fingered as the bad guy in this, so instead of having the whole system turn on them, they turned the whole system against itself. You remember, they made the mistake in 1992, which led to the system correction in 1994. Instead of the system bouncing back at them this time, they embedded some new code into the agenda: “We aren’t the enemy. They (ambiguously waving a hand in a general direction) are.” They figured that, to get the system to “progress,” they would have to turn it against itself. This led to the emergence of groups like Occupy, The Tea Party, BLM, the reemergence of White Supremacist groups and the Alt-right, Antifa, and the Proud Boys. When the system begins to correct and we begin to see that they are the enemy, the media creates another “them” to distract us that much longer so they can, while we are all fighting each other, embed more corrective code. That is, until they lost complete control of the system. As we all began screaming at each other that we didn’t like the idea that we couldn’t control our lives (whether or not we wanted to get gay married or a machine gun, or both), suddenly Morpheus, hand on our shoulders, told us, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN. During our being lectured to about how we OWED Hillary Clinton’s presidency to all women, a man parted the curtain for a minute and said, “It doesn’t have to be this way.” You realize that Donald Trump has been inside the media curtain and probably knows a bit of the code they’ve been using. After all, he was able to turn battlegrounds from Florida, Iowa, and North Carolina to Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. These were Democrat strongholds, folks. That doesn’t happen “by accident.” Trump knew exactly where the weaknesses in the System were to tweak it to get a result he wanted. This man singularly defeated scandal after scandal after media-created scandal, to the point where they literally were digging in decade-old media footage in a basement to come up with the “grab ’em by the p***y” comments. That is how Donald Trump red-pilled me. What did he know that I didn’t? How could he literally say that Megyn Kelly was menstruating on live effing television and get away with it? Do I like the guy? What the hell is there to like about him? Literally, none of us would ever be friends with the guy. Not a single one of us. He is the antithesis of the “regular Joe American.” He is about as relatable of a guy to us as is 99% of the Hollywood Elite. He literally would be the last guy any of us would ever invite to our homes for a Saturday barbeque. This dude literally can’t comprehend our lives in any way. Do you think he would know, for a fraction of a millisecond, what it would be like to wear a T-shirt and shorts, sitting on the couch, watching “Schitt’s Creek” and drinking a lukewarm Mountain Dew? He is not one of us, and we will never be one of his. Ever. But I actually voted for him in 2020. Why? Because I’ve been awaked to see that the enemy here is the media. They are on their Hail Mary pass right now. This is no longer a mission; It is a suicide mission. They have their distraction out there. They have their barely-lucid septuagenarian center stage, embarrassing himself. He’s the court jester. He’s not a threat. He’s just fun, ol’ Uncle Joe. Everyone, listen to Uncle Joe read billboard-sized teleprompters and tell us anecdotal stories about his dad, while we insert the corrective code. That code? That code is Kamala Harris. It is then you realize what came out of the reprogramming of 2004-2006 wasn’t just Barack Obama. Obama was the frontal attack. Kamala Harris was the flank. When you consider that she’s never completed her terms, literally ever. She went from San Francisco DA to California AG to California senator to VP candidate in just 12 years. She’s the female Barack Obama and has virtually the same story. Another thing they have in common? Kamala is the hidden twin-spawn of that unholy unity that created Obama. Literally the same in every way. Upbringing, Education, Ideology, down to their friggin’ fingerprints. She is here to finish what BHO couldn’t. And it took Donald Trump’s red pill to help me realize that. I enthusiastically voted for Gary Johnson in 2016. I wrote articles opposing Donald Trump’s presidency and welcomed the title of Never-Trumper. I was a part of the system. I thought Donald Trump was the enemy, even up until the point I was filling out my 2020 ballot. My ballot this year, for some reason, had down-ticket races first and Presidential last. I was excited to fill out my ballot for some of my very close friends running for office. It wasn’t until I got through the ballot and realized I hadn’t voted for president. Except that I did. I had voted for another four years of Donald Trump and Mike Pence, without even thinking about it. That was the moment I unplugged. I realized Donald Trump isn’t the enemy. The media-created system is. Donald Trump is simply the tool for fighting it. That… That’s why I voted for Donald Trump. That’s why I want another four years of disruption, because I refuse to be part of the system that perpetually divides Americans. The system knows we all hate that division, so it embedded code to convince us to think that, if we maybe vote for a particular candidate, that the division will go away. But remember when that division really took off, though: During Barack Obama’s presidency. And now his heir apparent is waiting in the wings. Why would we think for a single second that electing Biden would make it better? What they are engaging in is ideological gaslighting. They are making you think that your anger at them is unjustified, and that voting for someone other than Donald Trump is the cure. You’d be crazy to think that Trump leaving office fixes this. It doesn’t. In 2008, it was: “Vote for Obama or you’re a racist.” Now it is: “Vote for Biden or you are filled with hatred.” Same message, different time. If you’ve read this far, you’re probably expecting some football spiking ending to this realization. There really isn’t one. All I realized is that, no matter what the media says about Donald Trump, it probably contains some truth. I just don’t care anymore because, for them, it was never about the truth in the first place. It was about control. Do I love Donald Trump? Gosh, no. But I am starting to believe that he’s the only thing standing between us and the media’s efforts for total ideological annihilation.

        "articles": "One of the big fictions of the Hillary Clinton campaign just went off the rails. Ever since the email scandal broke, the Clinton machine has been adamant about was the fact that the investigation was an administrative one, where the nice FBI agents act as management consultants, rather than an investigation into criminal misconduct. You may recall, back in July, the Clinton camp bullied the New York Times into making a traction when they characterized the investigation as criminal. Some things have started to change. For instance, earlier in the week we got a peak at an FBI filing trying to limit pubic disclosure of information on the Clinton investigation: “[A]ll of the materials retrieved from any electronic equipment obtained from former Secretary Clinton for the investigation are evidence, potential evidence, or information that has not yet been assessed for evidentiary value,” the FBI said in the filing. Release of any of that additional information “could reasonably be expected to interfere with the pending investigation,” it added. Just a short while ago, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was talking up Obama’s endorsement of Hillary Clinton. A reporter brought up the issue of the propriety of Obama endorsing Hillary Clinton as she is under investigation (a subject I hit upon earlier today) REPORTER: “Previously the President has used one public forum or another to comment on the FBI investigation into Mrs. Clinton and her e-mail conduct. At one point he stated that as far as he could see there was no damage done to national security. You yourself from this podium have suggested that the investigation wasn’t trending toward any focus on Mrs. Clinton herself. I wonder if you could address for us the potential conflict of interest that might exist when the President of the United States, the head of the executive branch, is openly saying ‘I want this woman to succeed me in the Oval Office’ and you have other employees of the executive branch, career prosecutors, FBI agents working this case who have now just heard how the President wants to see this case resolved in essence. Isn’t there some conflict there?” WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST: “James, there’s not. You noted instances where the President was asked about the FBI investigations. And in each of those answers the President made clear that that is being conducted independent of any sort of political interference. That is a principle that the President is resolutely committed. You mentioned my comments, my comments were actually also in response to a question and were a reference to a published reports of comments from FBI officials that — about the direction of the — of the investigation. But, look, the reason that the President feels confident that he can go out and make this endorsement and record a video in which he describes his strong support for Secretary Clinton’s campaign is that he knows the people who are conducting the investigation aren’t going to be swayed by any sort of political interference. They aren’t going to be swayed by political forces. They know that their investigation should be guided by the facts and that they should follow the evidence where it leads. The President has complete confidence that that’s exactly what they’ll do.” REPORTER: “So when a career prosecutor or an FBI agent working on the Clinton investigation hears this President speak openly about how he wants Hillary Clinton to succeed him, you don’t think that that career prosecutor or that FBI agent takes that as some indication as to how the President wants to see this case resolved?” EARNEST: “No. I think those career prosecutors understand that they have job to do, and that that job they are supposed to do — which is to follow the facts, to pursue the evidence to a logical conclusion — that’s a job that they are responsible for doing without any sort of political interference. And the president expects them to do that job, this is the reason that we actually ask career federal prosecutors to take the lead on these kinds of matters. They don’t have political jobs. They have career jobs as law enforcement officers and as prosecutors and investigators. That’s what their responsibility is. And that’s why the President when discussing this issue in each stage has reiterated his commitment to this principle that any criminal investigation should be conducted independent of any sort of political interference and that people should be treated the same way before the law regardless of their political influence, regardless of their political party, regardless of their political stature and regardless of what political figure has endorsed them.” REPORTER: “Has President Obama ever discussed the Department of Justice investigation with Mrs. Clinton?” EARNEST: “He has not.” This is hardly a slip of the tongue. The bad blood between Obama and the Clintons is legendary and maybe he decided to simply do what he had to do in light of Clinton obviously clinching the nomination while making it clear that he had washed his hands of her. This doesn’t mean that the fix isn’t in but it does mean that for the first time the White House has admitted that the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email is criminal. Possibly related.

        "articles": "Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at New Hope Baptist Church, Sunday, March 8, 2020, in Jackson, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) Some people have been wondering where Joe Biden has been. Well, to be honest, I and probably most weren’t. Because maybe with all that’s going on, he really wasn’t missed. But others had noticed that he seemed to be missing for the last several days, even after announcing that he would be trying to do “shadow briefings” of President Donald Trump’s Wuhan virus briefings. Something he doesn’t seem to understand is a terrible idea and not in the interests of the country. There’s one president and one person in charge. It’s not him. To try to undermine the response at this point when most are trying to pull together is just unconscionable. But that seems to be the order of the day with the Democrats, who also held up the virus relief bill which would have helped Americans facing serious difficulty because of the restrictions that have been in place on movement and their ability to work. But #whereisJoe trended on Friday. Writer Glenn Greenwald mocked his absence. “Joe Biden’s omnipresence, steely calm and inspiring leadership has shown the US what A Real President does in times of crises,” he said last week. ”Oh wait — has anyone seen Joe?” The last time he’s made remarks on camera it hadn’t gone well, as you can see here.

But people only pointed out “where was Joe” because he wasn’t in it. They also pointed out that Klain was a lawyer and political operative ahad no experience in public health, prior to being appointed to the position. Those same folks who attacked Vice President Mike Pence over his lack of medical experience being in charge of the White House Virus Task Force because you have to have an administrator coordinating, likely had no problem when Klain was appointed by Obama. Nor did they call him out trying to explain the virus on behalf of Biden. But Biden finally did emerge today. But, as usual with Joe, it didn’t go particularly well. He looked horrible, old and confused. It started badly, with him touching his face, one of the critical guidelines not to do with the current pandemic.

        "articles": "The current real numbers are just fine, Trump was expected to win New York, optimistic news I had received not with standing. Yes Trump got 90 delegates. Yes he did well. Yes Kasich got 5 delegates, his first in how long? Yes yes and yes. And No I am not even bothered. Real Numbers: Cruz 696 Delegates to Trumps 815 Delegates. Whats left now? California 172 Indiana 57 New Jersey 51 Washington 44 Maryland 38 Nebraska 36 West Virginia 34 South Dakota 29 Connecticut 28 Oregon 28 Montana 27 New Mexico 24 Rhode Island 19 Pennsylvania 17 +54 Trump needs to get 422 delegates, out of that list. He loses Montana in full, the 54 in Pennsylvania are gone, Oregon is a wipe for him (he gets 3-6), Washington is already soured to him (maybe 4-6 there), Indiana is looking like Ted Cruz, S. Dakota is Ted Cruz, no one will give Nebraska to Trump, New Mexico is unlikely Trump… These “losses” (we will leave the gains in play) add up to 283 of 658, leaving 337 delegates left for Trump to try to win. Look he ain’t taking all of California either, even if he gets 120 out of there he loses 52 more, which means he comes up short by 137 missing delegates. Yes you read that correct, even if we tilt California for Trump he cannot win, he misses by 137 delegates. Even if he wins three small States, or Indiana and a medium State, he comes up missing by far too much. Mathematically Trump has been out for a while, it is a Contested Convention. In fact it is worse than that for Donald Trump because he messed up in West Virginia and automatically loses 3 delegates minimum there, he started his campaign office in California so late that a number of us pundits think he cannot get delegates for all the Congressional Districts there, and Rhode Island is a proportional election. Trump cannot get enough delegates from the remaining States even if he picks up 2 major surprise wins. Ted Cruz has seen an additional bunch of Delegates arrive with his securing S. Carolina for sure (while not fully voted yet you can take this to the bank), Nebraska voted their delegates for Cruz, and Indiana is a done deal according to Party Insiders. Those 54 in Pennsylvania are rumored to be in contention, but not for Trump. Apparently Kasich is making a big play there. However it still hurts Trump significantly, leaving him no way to continue on. One of the most surprising developments was Florida and New Jersey. Rubio had his team walk over everyone in Florida, those 99 delegates are his. In New Jersey Christie is actually strong-arming the leadership in a potentially illegal manner, and is securing almost all of the slates there. Yes you read those right, they secured their home States and not for Trump. However I reiterate, Trump has already lost the challenge to get to 1237 delegates. There is NO CHANCE OF A TRUMP NOMINATION. Current Pledged Delegates for Cruz is estimated by me to be at 865 delegates. Where does Ted Cruz secure the remaining delegates? He needs 372 to win the convention on 2nd or 3rd ticket (vote): Oregon 28 Oklahoma 43 California (projected) 100 South Dakota 29 Pennsylvania (Possible Kasich) 54 Arkansas 40 Kansas 40 Kentucky 46 Montana 27 The list goes on. We have only really gotten a bit over half way in the actual positions. Ted Cruz is the champion here, no other is coming close currently. There is well in excess of 450 delegates I deem “likely” to “Guaranteed” for Ted Cruz. Due to the machinations of Kasich, Rubio, and Christie the establishment has secured 235 delegates already. This means when Ted Cruz gets 137 more delegates to pledge to him that Trump is mathematically out there as well without offering one of them (Not Rubio) the Vice Presidency, and he is 222 delegates being pledged for Ted Cruz to be guaranteed mathematically eliminated in a contested convention. The odds of Trump getting the nomination is now under 1% in my view. Yes that statement is correct. Trump cannot turn the tide in enough States, his efforts in New Mexico are also showing lagging (he had to strong arm them to extend the time he needs to search for people to be potential delegates) and he cannot win so many pledges in an obvious hostile venue in the remaining time. Trump is done. So, here I am, the first of the major and minor Statisticians, I am calling the election formally for Ted Cruz. Yes this is my formal announcement. I was going to wait until April 27th, but the nature of the States has been provided to me by various sources, and I am confident that even with two major upsets that Trump is not going to win. Congratulations Ted Cruz for winning the Republican Nomination for President. ",

        "articles": "To answer the question in the headline…I do not personally believe Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) was inviting unstable, crazy people to harm Senator Ted Cruz. These days we have to abandon nuance much of the time and state the obvious up front because conservative media is being punished and deplatformed by Big Tech for even whispering dissenting opinions on the mainstream narrative. On Thursday, Senator Ted Cruz tweeted out support for AOC’s position that Congress needs to be a bit more curious about how apps like Robinhood have been restricting free trading to favor hedge funds taking a beating on the free market. AOC, who never lets a good clapback go to waste, tweeted in return that she wanted nothing to do with Cruz’ cooperation as he “almost had me murdered 3 weeks ago.” One can hardly deny that according to current Big Tech censorship rules this type of statement might encourage some mentally unfit followers to avenge her attempted murder by bringing harm to Senator Cruz. No one here is saying that AOC is being violent. What we are saying is that according to our moral compass on the Right, she is simply being hyperbolic to make a point. She has an opinion and even if it’s a terrible take, it’s hers to wield as she sees fit. What Big Tech and their cohorts in the Democrat media complex are saying and have been saying since January 6th is that anyone who says anything that could give even just a few crazies some dangerous ideas to commit violence is complicit in any violence that does occur. It doesn’t matter if it was your intention. If you tell a lie that someone believes as truth, or utter an opinion that someone then uses to justify madness then you are inciting violence and even sedition. These are the rules. The Right did not make them. Bernie Bros did not make them. Donald Trump did not make them. Left-wing Big Tech, Democrat media outlets and the Democrat party themselves made them. “Inciting” has become the word du jour and they’ll be sure to beat that horse until it’s dead, just like they did with “gravitas” and “privilege.” For now it has come to encompass anything that a mentally unstable person could perceive as a reason to be violent. Under this logic, Jodi Foster is responsible for Reagan’s shooting. Maxine Waters is responsible for a summer of Antifa violence. And most certainly CNN, MSNBC, The Democrat Party and every left-wing reporter and social media account on the internet are responsible for the near fatal shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise at a congressional baseball game. They had created so much hysteria surrounding impending Obamacare rollbacks that they incited a lunatic to kill any Republicans he could in defense of what he saw as (and had been told was) the only thing that could save healthcare for poor Americans. AOC’s pettiness aside, it would be the preference for most on the right – including Senator Cruz, I suspect – for her to be able to tweet whatever ridiculousness she wants. However, unless Big Tech intends on returning their platforms to a market approach based on free speech values, I’m afraid we must insist that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez have her account suspended until she removes this possibly inciting tweet. Who knows what crazies are out there right now planning to avenge her attempted murder by bringing harm to Cruz? @TwitterSafety I'd like to report this tweet. @AOC accusing a sitting senator of attempted murder…can we at least get a fact check? This type of accusation is not only subject to libel, it makes a lot of ppl feel unsafe. What if she's inciting retaliation against @SenTedCruz ?  — Kira (@RealKiraDavis) January 28, 2021 If AOC’s standard of “incitement” is applied to herself, she far exceeds the standard for having blood on her hands. 30 people were killed this summer. Your words fueled those riots, by your standard. By your standard, you had 30 people killed. Murderer.  — Amanda (@AmandaPresto) January 28, 2021 Kira is a freelance writer and Editor-at-large for .

        "articles": "North Carolina has been a hotbed of protests, riots, and media attention since police shot a black man named Keith Scott. Since his shooting, people have debated the legitimacy of the police action. Video shows Scott backing up, with hands at his side when the shots ring out, and he goes down. The video does not show Scott raising a weapon nor, however, does it show his right hand. During the video you can clearly hear police showing for Scott to drop his gun. It was later shown that Scott did have a gun on him, as well as marijuana. Originally, the police knew about the marijuana but chose to ignore it as they were there for a much more pressing reason. Only when Scott brandished his gun in his car did they decide to move in on him for safety reasons. It was even confirmed by Scott’s wife that he carried a black 9mm with him in a restraining order she filed against him. CNN gave a breakdown of the event, and all events since. However, in their reporting, CNN made an odd mischaracterization of North Carolina’s gun laws, almost to the point of shoehorning it in. Officers decided to approach Scott after Officer Brentley Vinson saw Scott hold up a gun up while in his SUV, police have said. North Carolina is an open-carry state, meaning gun owners can carry their firearms in public and openly in their vehicles. As Sean Davis points out at the Federalist, this is absolutely ludicrous, and it’s clear that CNN has very little idea as to what they’re talking about. “Open carry” does not mean you can have your gun in hand, out of its holster, waving it around. As Davis points out, this is called “brandishing,” and this action is to legally be taken as a threatening state. Furthermore, Scott wasn’t allowed to have a gun as he was a convicted felon. CNN details none of this, choosing only to mischaracterize North Carolinas gun laws, and the concept of open carry. Davis wraps it up nicely for us. Rather than lawfully open carrying, as CNN implies Scott was doing, Scott was actually a felon (legally banned from gun possession) under the influence of drugs (which also legally bans an individual from gun possession) who was carrying a concealed weapon (which is banned for non-permit holders) which he then brandished (also illegal) and which he then refused to surrender to police (also illegal). It would be extremely difficult for Scott to have simultaneously violated any more gun laws than he did. Police saw him smoking marijuana and decided to give him a pass on his apparent penchant for weed since they were focused on more important matters. It wasn’t until Scott, by openly using illegal drugs while in possession of a firearm, left police no choice but to confront him. Yet CNN didn’t just refuse to provide that information, its reporters went out of their way to mischaracterize North Carolina’s gun laws. Its readers deserve better than lies and half-truths about what happened in Charlotte. I’m not exactly sure what CNN, who clearly had all the facts in front of them, were trying to do by addressing open carry the way they did. Either the reporting author is ignorant of said gun laws, or intentionally looped in North Carolina’s open carry law – which Scott completely broke in more ways than one – to paint it as unwholesome. At a time when racial tensions are at a height, and groups are looking for reason to riot and destroy, this kind of misleading information is not at all helpful. Senior Editor.

Trump returns from a visit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the border village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea as well as the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Some news from the trade war front. China has decided to exempt pork and soybeans from future tariffs, giving a much needed reprieve to the agricultural sector in the United States. There was joking last week when China lifted tariffs on a few inconsquential items that it was an “olive twig,” but this move signals something bigger. Via Reuters. SHANGHAI (Reuters) – China will exempt some agricultural products from additional tariffs on U.S. goods, including pork and soybeans, China’s official Xinhua News Agency said Friday, in the latest sign of easing Sino-U.S. tensions before a new round of talks aimed at curbing a bruising trade war. The United States and China have both made conciliatory gestures, with China renewing purchases of U.S. farm goods and U.S. President Donald Trump delaying a tariff increase on certain Chinese goods. This is likely happening for reasons related to China’s condition, not as a gesture of good will. China would like nothing more than to stick it to us but they rely on our agricultural products to keep their people from starving. An outbreak of deadly African swine fever, which has cut China’s pig herd by a third since mid-2018, has propelled Chinese pork prices to record levels and left the country in need of replacement supplies from overseas. U.S. pork exports to China so far this year have largely fallen short of expectations. That issue of diseases didn’t just come out of nowhere. It is a result of China sourcing unsafe Russian pork to try to replace what we were selling them. In other words, China needs us and they are starting to feel the pinch. Hence, they lifted these tariffs because they need the imports, not just to be nice. It’s disappointing that just last week I saw some conservatives on Twitter snarking that Trump should retreat and declare victory. That’s short sighted and stupid. It’s exactly the kind of attitude that got Trump elected, i.e. the idea that Republicans aren’t willing to fight the tough battles. Trump is winning this trade war. For now, the U.S. has been largely left unscathed, with the markets already rebounding big after a scare a few weeks ago. The question is whether Trump can finish this before 2020. This isn’t something he’s going to want hanging over his head. That’s the only wildcard in this. Enjoying the read? Please visit my archive and check out some of my latest articles.

Governor Bob McDonnell signed the Virginia law on which the suit is based days before ObamaCare went into effect, not afterward as the Fourth Circuit had it. rs will know this suit as the Ken Cuccinelli one. James Lakely of the Heartland Institute said (emphasis added): The Court said Virginia couldn’t nullify Obamacare because its law doing so was signed by the governor after the president signed his health care bill. Trouble is, Gov. Bob McDonnell signed his bill days before Obama signed his. It was only McDonnell’s public signing ceremony that came afterward. Maureen Martin, senior fellow for legal affairs at Heartland wrote in the Heartlander that a Fourth Circuit panel “made a ‘rookie’ factual error serious enough to call for invalidation of its entire decision”. Virginia had enacted a state statute — the Virginia Health Care Freedom Act (VHCFA) — declaring the individual mandate contained in the Obamacare bill did not apply to its citizens. Virginia then filed a lawsuit alleging the individual mandate violates the Commerce Clause of the United States because the federal government lacks the constitutional power to require individual citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. But the Appeals Court held last week that Virginia lacked standing, because (as the court erroneously thought) having signed the state law after ObamaCare went into effect meant the state statute was a mere a political attack on it.

That much we know. In fact, so dire is Venezuela’s economy that a video game’s virtual currency is worth far more than its real-life currency the bolivar. As such, many Venezuelan’s can’t afford simple things like bread or toilet paper. As a quick fix, Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro ordered that minimum wage in the country be jacked up some 3000 percent so that Venezuelans can have a living wage. What resulted was a lot of firings as businesses could no longer afford their employees. From Bloomberg: Starting this week, 7 million employees are guaranteed 1,800 bolivars a month — worth about $20 at the black-market rate. President Nicolas Maduro intended the mandate as political boost, but it’s having the opposite effect as companies, already hit by Venezuela’s epic economic contraction, tell workers they can’t afford to keep them. While there have been many similar moves in the past, never has one been so disruptive, arriving amid hyperinflation, depression and devaluation. Some employers are restructuring costs, rejiggering pay scales and negotiating settlements with workers. Others are simply dismissing people. Much of the action happens secretively as companies try to avoid punishment by the government, which has been jailing those it believes are flouting the rules. How the Venezuelan government didn’t see this coming is beyond me, but when you’re a socialist dictator looking to score political points in your failing country, the correct answer is always “give someone else’s stuff away.” That it would have brought people back into the realm of milk and honey is a pipe dream. You can’t give to one without taking from another, and when you take too much from one, they run out of stuff for you to give out. This pattern is seen repeated throughout the world, even here in the U.S. Starbucks had to close over 100 stores in June in areas where the “Fight for 15” crowd had victories, choosing instead to move the stores to a less expensive area. In fact, research was done to see what would happen if California was able to secure a $15 an hour for the state by the Employment Policies Institute, and found Californians will have lost over 400,000 jobs by 2022 due to the fact that businesses wouldn’t be able to afford the extra expense. The punchline is that raising wages does nothing to help. It only leaves people jobless. Senior Editor. Culture critic, and video creator. Good at bad photoshops. ",

On Friday, Joe Biden gave an interview on the popular black-oriented radio show “Breakfast Club.” The host is Lenard McKelvey who goes by the name Charlamagne tha God. To say it didn’t go well is like saying the Titanic was a bit late for its New York arrival. \"It's not about Trump. It's about who is going to present the best deal for black people. … I vote my interests, and my interests are black.\" -Radio host @cthagod on Joe Biden saying \"if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\" pic.twitter.com/tc7ipWYW5K — CNN (@CNN) May 23, 2020 “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.” There is a ton of stuff wrong with this starting with Biden trying show how ‘down with the movement’ he is by using ‘ain’t’…a word he doesn’t use. But the idea that black votes are the unique possession of the Democrat party and that a person’s actual racial identity is suspect if they vote for a Republican for president is simply grotesque. And yet there were those who immediately jumped to Biden’s defense. Not overtly but using the tired Vichy Republican ideas of ‘we can’t win, so let’s surrender’ and ‘we are just as bad as they are so we can’t criticize them.’ The ppl who attacked Romney for 'binders full of women' are awful, low, cynical goons.

Here we have an least one significant media figure complaining about the amount of coverage that the ‘you ain’t black’ comment is getting. We have another fringe figure complaining that the media are being bullied into covering the story presumably because the Trump campaign is making an significant fuss about it. I will note, for the record, that if you visit the front page of what purports to be one of the major right-tilting or inclining media outlets in the country, there is not a whisper of this story to be found. This shows the extent to which the failure of the mainstream to cover a story is simply a function of laziness, lack of ambition, if not actual complicity on the part of conservative media. The fear of saying something that will offend the left permeates that class of conservative(ish) pundits and journalist wannabes who know that if they want to make that big jump to the ‘real’ media or land a contributor slot on CNN or MSNBC they have to play to lose. Time an again the real progress made in moving the ball forward, whether it be deconstructing the Covington Kids narrative, to the non-plagiarized investigation of Ilhan Oman, to the expose of California Democrat Katie Hill that ultimately forced her from office, is done by conservatives who happen to be journalists, not by journalists trying to use a gig at a conservative publication as a springboard to something bigger.

        "articles": "In a memo sent out on Tuesday afternoon, Fox News executive Dana Blanton had to remind the network’s politics team and TV producers that they were not to use unscientific polls in their reporting. She explained in the memo obtained by Business Insider, “As most of the publications themselves clearly state, the sample obviously can’t be representative of the electorate because they only reflect the views of those Internet users who have chosen to participate…Another problem — we know some campaigns/groups of supporters encourage people to vote in online polls and flood the results,” she wrote. “These quickie click items do not meet our editorial standards.” The memo came after multiple Fox News hosts, including Trump’s best pal Sean Hannity, cited online polls from places like Drudge Report and Time as proof that Trump had won the debate. Further, the only scientific poll Hannity even mentioned on air after the debate Monday was the CNN poll, which he discredited by insinuating they are biased: “I have it in front of me. Time magazine, Drudge Report, CNBC, The Hill, CBS — the only one that has Hillary winning is CNN, and they are the ‘Clinton News Network.” It should be noted at this point that Hannity was not even correct. A poll commissioned by Breitbart showed Clinton winning (although by a narrow margin). A PPP poll likewise showed Clinton winning 52-40. As noted in the Business Insider article, a Morning Consult poll also showed Clinton winning the debate. In other words, there were four scientific polls taken post-debate, and all of them showed Clinton winning. Steve Doocy on Fox and Friends continued the trend the next day, noting it was “fascinating” that Trump had won so many online polls, although he did at least note that the polls were unscientific. Credit to Fox News brass for at least attempting to maintain some dignity, but it did not work. Even after the memo went out, Hannity continued grasping at straws and using these online polls as proof Donald Trump had won, making the comment, “You’ve got this list of polls, Donald Trump wins. You watch TV, Hillary Clinton wins.” Brian Kilmeade of Fox and Friends apparently also missed the memo, telling Trump himself on Wednesday morning, “The online polls show you guys won in overwhelming margins.” It really is fascinating that a major news network has to actually be told not to use unscientific online polls. Here at , we do not have a multimillion dollar budget and do not hold ourselves out as the only objective news source on the planet – but we would never treat a Drudge Poll like a serious item of news. I mean, nobody treats Drudge Polls like actual news – they are obviously fake news designed to make Drudge readers feel good about participating in something, I guess. What’s even more fascinating is that even after being reminded by their corporate brass that reporting fake news is not a wise choice, Fox News hosts continue to do it. Maybe part of the problem is that, so far as we can tell, neither Doocy, Kilmeade, or Hannity have in any way been punished for flouting basic editorial direction. What will Hannity have to use after the next debate to prove to himself that Trump won? Maybe he can start a Twitter poll. Follow @SaraGonzalesTX ",

It’s one of the few times you actually get to see a lighter side to Ted Cruz, who often gets complaints about coming off as a used car salesman turned preacher. As it turns out, his skit even caused me to breath air out of my nose faster than normal. It was a good few minutes spent, but apparently I’m not the only one who thinks that. Going over the responses to it from last night, it turns out that a good majority of people were loving Cruz’s appearance on the late night talk show, and not just Republicans. Turns out, he even charmed some on the left.

Cruz seemed relaxed, and funny, and apparently it spoke to people enough that the negative tweets were fewer. Republicans were overwhelmingly positive, and I’m personally glad to see the right show up to take part in the culture, especially when its so rare. How this appearance will affect Cruz remains to be seen, but if his appearance on Fallon has helped him at all, it could be another thorn in the side of Trump, who is already feeling some sting since he’s polling below 50 statewide in New York.

        "articles": "Early Friday morning, former Democratic Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum’s “friend,” Travis Dyson, overdosed on crystal meth in a Miami Beach hotel room and was rushed to the hospital by rescue personnel. Gillum was too intoxicated to communicate with investigators at the time, but later returned to “his residence” on his own accord. Fortunately Dyson was on the mend as of Friday afternoon, as our Brad Slager reported. Gillum released a statement saying that he was in Miami for a wedding (without his wife), and when Dyson was reached at the hospital by a reporter for the Miami New Times he confirmed that the two had been friends “for a while” but that Gillum hadn’t mentioned anything about a wedding. Well, what was going on? We’ve found a few clues. As reported initially, Dyson rented the hotel room for himself and Aldo Mejias, who resides in Miami Beach. Gillum was reportedly staying at the Kimpton Epic in Miami, which is essentially across the street from the address in Brickell reported as Dyson’s apartment in the police report. Why did they need another hotel room? The Miami Herald confirmed that an Instagram profile reported to  as belonging to the Travis Dyson who had been in the hotel room with Gillum indeed belonged to that Travis Dyson. According to public records, Dyson is a registered nurse who lives in Brickell. His Instagram account features selfies in scrubs and a medical coat. The page also features numerous photos of Dyson, clearly a body builder, posing on the beach, on boats or at night spots with friends, including his fiance. His public Instagram account was turned private sometime Friday afternoon. Dyson’s Instagram handle is also linked to a profile on Rent Men, where he described himself as “Brodie Scott,” “pornstar performer” who offered “gay massage.” Multiple pornographic videos of Dyson and his boyfriend/fiance, (Instagram handle @lvbrazil), were posted to that site and even to Twitter. (Note: Those links are very NSFW.) Those have all been deleted as of Friday afternoon. On a fan thread referencing Dyson’s Rent Men profile, there is a photo of Dyson in his scrubs. The man in whose name the hotel room was rented, Aldo Mejias, is also a medical professional, a pathologist whose license to practice medicine in Florida expired January 31, 2019. According to the Florida Department of Health website, an Aldo Mejias with the same email address listed on the police report (honeyhammock at emailprovider-dot-com, for real) had privileges at Palm Springs General Hospital and Aventura Hospital and Medical Center. The police report said that Mejias is the one who called 911 then performed chest compressions on Dyson, who was apparently having a heart attack, while waiting for rescue personnel to arrive. While Mejias was saving Dyson’s life, CNN Contributor Andrew Gillum was vomiting in the bathroom. Indeed, as Brad noted earlier, there continue to be more questions than answers.

        "articles": "One has to wonder why two Republican Senators, without any warning, would suddenly announce they’d oppose Betsy Devo’s nomination to be the Secretary of Education. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska both said they’d vote against Devos because she lacked the necessary experience to “strengthen public schools.” Whatever that means. I for one would like to see the Department of Education wind up in a dumpster where it belongs. It was created as a payoff to the teacher’s unions by Jimmy Carter and since its birth has done little to improve public education. Therefore, it seems to oppose Devos on her lack of work in public schools. What exactly has that done for the public school system over the last 37 years? Nothing. Perhaps it is time to let somebody without experience in the public education system to try something new. But that won’t happen as long as the teacher’s unions still a lot of power. Speaking of teachers unions, guess which two Senators have been getting donations from them. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. This report from Bill McMorris at the Free Beacon spells it out: Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) and Susan Collins (R., Maine) have each benefited from contributions from the National Education Association. Collins received $2,000 from the union in 2002 and 2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Murkowski, meanwhile, has received $23,500. The NEA represents 3 million members, making it the wealthiest and most influential union in the country. The NEA, along with other labor groups like the American Federation of Teachers, has waged a fierce campaign against DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist and school choice activist. Teachers unions donate almost exclusively to Democrats. The NEA contributed $2.3 million to Democratic candidates in 2016, while Republican nominees received $350,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The top beneficiaries of union largesse have already voted against DeVos’ nomination at the committee level. The union donated $740,000 to the 11 Democratic members of that committee—all 11 attempted to prevent the nomination from reaching the Senate floor. Murkowski received a 100 percent rating on a 2012 NEA Report Card, while Collins received a 75 percent rating—the only Republicans to earn marks above 50 percent from the group. Each senator has earned straight-A marks from the union since 2014. Surprised? Both will likely deny any influence from teachers unions, but both of them live in rural states and rely on every penny they can get for re-election purposes. I have no doubt the phones rang in their office with people representing those unions wanting to express their “concerns” about Devos. Devos will likely still be confirmed, but it may come down to Vice-President Mike Pence casting the deciding vote in a 50-50 split. We’ll see what happens. ",

        "articles": "Caricature by DonkeyHotey flic.kr/p/Ct4G4K This sounds like a hissy fit, doesn’t it. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is taking a pass on Colorado’s Republican assembly this weekend. On Saturday, State Party Chairman Steve House said that Trump was close to finalizing plans to attend Saturday’s Colorado Republican State Convention at the Broadmoor World Arena in Colorado Springs. Plans by the Republican frontrunner to attend the event, however, have fallen through. “He will not be attending,” said Kyle Kohli, communications director for the state GOP. At the state convention Saturday, the party will elect 13 delegates to the national convention. What might be the reason for this. Colorado is going to be another state where by dint of sheer incompetence that Trump is going to get shut out. As Leon quoted in his post earlier today: Cruz’s operation is headed up by Congressman Ken Buck, his state chairman and a mainstay in Colorado’s GOP. Trump’s campaign has no official state chair and it’s not clear who’s running things. James Baker, the campaign’s initial point person for the state, was fired this week amid infightingbetween senior staff, according to a Politico report. Baker did not respond to an email from MSNBC on Wednesday. In an ominous sign for Trump, two Colorado Congressional districts already held their conventions this week and Cruz swept both events, installing six delegates pledged to support him come convention time. State representative Justin Everett, who was picked as a Cruz delegate, said the campaign kept in constant contact with him and other candidates for delegate by phone and email. They helped draw up talking points for speeches, distributed pro-Cruz delegate slates, and briefed participating local officials to make sure they didn’t fracture support. When the convention came, Everett said they faced some resistance from supporters of Ohio Governor John Kasich. But what surprised him was the lack of any pushback from Trump. “It seems like an epic fail on the Trump campaign’s part,” he said. “I don’t see anyone organizing.” Trump is not going to get a single delegate out of Colorado and, like the spoiled little rich boy he is, he’s showing his displeasure by simply blowing off the state convention. He’s acting like he already knows he’s going to lose because if he wins the nomination he will need the wholehearted support of the very people he’s snubbing this weekend.

        "articles": "Look, I apologize for this headline. I have to report the news, and there just isn’t a more family-friendly way to report this one. These are just the facts. A Los Angeles artist named Ilma Gore painted a picture of Donald Trump in the buff that was, shall we say, unflattering to the size of his manhood. I feel like we deserve credit for not including a picture of the painting itself in the post, because you definitely do NOT want to see it. I think that a normal person would have allowed this controversy to pass by just not commenting on it, because doing so would only cause the controversy to gain more attention. Plus, Donald Trump is one of the most famous people in the world and is the front runner to receive the nomination for President of one of the two major political parties in the United States. Who’s even heard of Ilma Gore before? But then, if Donald Trump weren’t pathologically insecure about everything, most especially the size of his manhood, he really wouldn’t be Donald Trump. He’d probably be set to actually win the Republican nomination, instead of only come tantalizingly close. From the New York Daily News: Painting a nude Donald Trump portrait was scary enough — but now a Los Angeles artist might be sued for it. The creative mind behind the infamous painting of Trump in the buff — and with a tiny penis — says Trump’s legal team has threatened a lawsuit over her dismaying depiction of GOP presidential front-runner. * * * Gore, who lives in Los Angeles, painted the birthday suit Trump in February — before Trump even felt the need to publicly defend the size of his manhood. She titled it “Make America Great Again.” She wrote this artist’s statement for it: “Because no matter what is in your pants, you can still be a big prick.” Prediction: we’re basically about two more late night TV jokes about this subject away from being treated to the “spectacle” of a septuagenarian pulling down his pants on live television to defend the honor of his male member. And to show you how doomed our society is, millions of people have voted for this man to actually be President. Of the United States. You know, a country with nuclear weapons. God help us all. ",

You chose to go to a school that cost that much, and you chose to take out a loan to afford it. Why should you be relieved of that voluntary loan you took out? Even worse, why should the rest of us pay for it? Because that is what you are asking. You are asking a lot of people to pay for your poor decision-making skills. But Kira, I needed to go to a good school so I could get a good job! No, David. You are not entitled to go to a “good” school any more than you are entitled to a “good” job. All across the country, for many, many years, people have done things they didn’t want to do in order to have the things they want. They go to community schools, take on extra jobs, delay education, or enter the workforce and choose to educate themselves in other ways. In fact, it looks as though you did the same thing. You made a sacrifice for yourself now so you could have what you want later. Now you’ve changed your mind and expect the world to stop to accommodate that. My kid doesn’t even do that. She’s been educated in the physics of consequences. I always tell her that she needs to be careful about the things she chooses to let her friends get her into, because not one of them can get her “whuppin” for her. You want make poor choices and let the rest of us take your whuppin’. Sorry young man, life doesn’t work like that. You say your debt now means you’ll never own a home, start a family, or live debt free. I’m not sure what things are like where you come from but being debt-free is not a requirement for buying a home and certainly not for starting a family. What kind of family are you thinking about starting – the Royal Family? Sure, raising children requires some funds but starting a family is practically free. Maybe you need to go back to school and pick up some biology classes. Perhaps, David you believe in this weird modern notion we have that one must be comfortably middle class to “afford” a family. I assure you, this is absolutely not a requirement and in fact is a hindrance to many young people who really should be starting child-rearing sooner rather than later but keep waiting for that magical designation of “comfortable” first. A lot of people miss a lot of life because they’re waiting for the perfect circumstances to start living. Children don’t make you poor, but your mentality sure does. However, if you’re the type of guy who happily burdens himself with $137,000 in loans before he’s even paid his first bill on his own, maybe it is better that you don’t raise children. Perhaps it is easier for you to tell yourself that it is your loans that keep you from finding a suitable mate. But Kira, this is what I had to do make a better life for myself! Its the system! Well, how’s that workin’ for ya? I don’t know what your degree is in but if it isn’t going to afford you the opportunity to pay back the giant loan you took out, maybe you need to start thinking about a course change.

        "articles": "The first time I ever saw a Wal-Mart I was a grad student getting my MBA down in Tallahassee, FL. One opened up down the road from my apartment and I was immediately taken by the big bright stores with lots of stuff and what seemed to be pretty low prices. In class I learned the secrets to Wal-Mart’s success in its niche of “Always low prices”. It demanded efficiencies from its suppliers. It became fanatical about using information technology to optimize its sourcing and distribution channels. It paid its employees the community average or sometimes slightly more, but never significantly so. And of course the company benefited tremendously from scale. At the end of the day Wal-Mart became a spectacular success because it provided the goods people wanted at the lowest prices possible. Thus began a two decade long love affair with Wal-Mart. For most of the last twenty years I’ve spent most of my shopping dollars, particularly food, but other items as well, at Wal-Mart. It helped that, as I hate to shop, I could go there and get pretty much everything I needed in one place, from apple juice to socks to those little trees you put in your car to make it smell good. I remember around 2003 when a friend of mine got married in Key West. I went to Wal-Mart and purchased a pair of those mesh shoes with the rubber sole that you could wear in the ocean. They cost about $7.95. I remember how amazed I was that they could manufacture that pair of shoes in China, label them, ship them across the ocean, transport them to my store where people would receive them, inventory them, display them and eventually charge me for them, and do so at a profit! Even if they paid their workers in China a penny a day I still didn’t see how they could do all of those things and still make a profit. When my love affair with Wal-Mart began the company had 1,500 stores mostly serving rural communities across the country and generated about $25 billion a year in sales. Today they have 10,000 stores around the world and generate half a trillion dollars in revenue annually. Like it or not, Wal-Mart has changed the face of American retail. By using the best of the free market the company has saved Americans hundreds of billions of dollars over its lifetime, savings that they might have used to can use to provide more food to their children, to give to charity to buy their kid a computer for college, or just buy another flat screen TV. By any definition Wal-Mart is an American success story. Unfortunately however, my love affair with Wal-Mart is fading… and fast. The first injury to the relationship was when the company supported ObamaCare in an effort to increase pressure on its smaller competitors. The second was when they supported the taxing of online sales. Since those two events I’ve reduced the money I spend in Wal-Mart by well over 50%. Now I’m beginning to wonder if I need to redirect most of what’s left. According to Bloomberg, the company is considering supporting the Obama administration’s move to raise the minimum wage. While Wal-Mart knows that it would incur higher wage costs, it also knows that because of its size and efficiency it can better weather the increase than most of its competitors. And that’s the problem. If Wal-Mart wants to raise the wages of its employees, it has every right to do so and most people would applaud it in the process. Indeed that is the route the Gap and Costco have chosen. But alas, that is not the route Wal-Mart seems to be taking. (They supported an increase back in 2007 as well.) Instead the company is seeking to use to use the power of government to tilt the marketplace in its favor. It wants to use the government to force higher costs on its smaller, less efficient competitors. Essentially it wants the government to put its competitors at a competitive disadvantage. This is the worst of capitalism – crony capitalism – when businesses use government to harm competitors or keep them at bay. Whether it’s Obamacare or a minimum wage increase or restaurants seeking to keep food trucks off the streets, it’s not only the competitors who lose, it’s the consumers and the market itself. Had Sears or K-Mart used the power of government to strangle baby Wal-Mart in its crib the company would not today be the largest retailer in the world. If AT&T had succeed in defending its government sanctioned monopoly and keeping MCI and other startup telephone companies at bay for another 100 years do you think we’d have iPhones, Netflix, or fixed price wireless plans? No. Of course not. The marketplace survives and thrives the less government intervenes. Wal-Mart of all companies should understand this. By getting into bed with government Wal-Mart is repudiating the very thing that allowed it to prosper in the first place – the free market. Now that the company has used that free market to become the 800 lb gorilla in the retail marketplace it has repeatedly sought to harness the power of government to keep potential rivals from enjoying the same opportunity. Crony capitalism is the most despicable form of capitalism because it hides behind the mask of free markets. Thankfully however crony capitalism usually fails because the propped up company often becomes fat and lazy and forgets how to compete. If Wal-Mart wants to betray free markets, so be it, I just hope it’s not too long before the markets decide to strike back. ",

        "articles": "If you’ve followed the saga of the Obama administration and how they dealt with the then incoming Trump administration, you are probably aware of an email Susan Rice sent to herself. In it, she seemed to almost be laying cover, repeating phrases like “by the book” and attempting to frame everything as above board. One line about refusing to share classified information with Trump’s team stood out, especially since it was a decision that didn’t seem to be within their purview. If Americans elect a new President, the prior administration doesn’t get to decide not to proceed with the transition properly, no matter what their suspicions are. The question of why Rice emailed herself has lingered. That’s certainly not a normal thing someone does. But more so, part of the email remained classified, robbing readers of key context within the conversation she was describing. Well, that’s no longer a problem, as CBS’ Catherine Herridge has obtained the declassified copy of the email. DEVELOPING: Declassified Rice email documenting WH meeting 1/5/2017 obtained @CBSNews pic.twitter.com/uA9V9oo4n4 — Catherine Herridge (@CBS_Herridge) May 19, 2020 What this provides is further evidence that the Obama administration was targeting Michael Flynn. It also shows that Obama himself was intimately involved in the campaign to kneecap the incoming NSA. Here we see the suggestion that sensitive information be withheld from Flynn, with Comey saying that should “potentially” be the case. There’s some irony in Comey’s “concerns” given it was his FBI that shared classified intelligence with Christopher Steele against regulations. What’s most noteworthy though is the lack of any evidence whatsoever to back up their suspicions. Talking to the Russian ambassador is not a crime, nor is discussing future policy goals during a transition. The Obama administration had no right at all to play god here and attempt to sandbag Flynn. They did so anyway, and in a way that would be seen as incredibly scandalous if a GOP administration had pulled this nonsense. Further, given the content of the now declassified paragraph, one must ask why it was specifically classified that way in the first place. Why hide this paragraph? The answer is likely because Flynn was under surveillance at the time. It should also be noted that Comey did not end up doing everything “by the book,” as he later admitted to breaking protocol to send agents to interrogate Flynn. What this email reads like is a CYA attempt by Rice. It’s likely that the meeting isn’t even being fully described here, but rather that this is a sanitized version meant to protect her if things ever fell apart. This way she can see “see, I thought at the time everything was by the book.” Even still, there’s enough revealed here to show that the Obama administration was out of line in their pursuit of Flynn, and when you couple this with how they eventually bent the rules to get him fired (and later charged by Mueller), things look even worse.

        "articles": "Bernie Sanders by Gage Skidmore, licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0/Original This is probably something CNN won’t be sharing with its audience, but there’s some pretty striking news on the shooter who perpetrated the Dayton, OH shooting, which followed an equally tragic shooting in El Paso, TX by what appears to be a white supremacist. Heavy.com got access to the shooter’s social media. Contrary to the media narrative currently boiling over, this shooter was not a Trump fan. In fact, he hated Trump, hated Republicans, was an avowed leftist, used antifa style language in his posts, and loved Elizabeth Warren. Here’s some of what was found. Bett’s Twitter profile read, “he/him / anime fan / metalhead / leftist / i’m going to hell and i’m not coming back.” One tweet on his page read, “Off to Midnight Mass. At least the songs are good. #athiestsonchristmas.” The page handle? I am the spookster. On one selfie, he included the hashtags, “#selfie4satan #HailSatan @SatanTweeting.” On the date of Republican Sen. John McCain’s death, he wrote, “F*ck John McCain.” On Nov. 2, 2018, he wrote: “Vote blue for gods sake.” Ironically, he was even a rabid supporter of gun control, using it to levy attacks against Republicans. “This is America: Guns on every corner, guns in every house, no freedom but that to kill,” he wrote in December 2018. And, “’Tis! The pistol is a Beretta 93R, called the REK7 in BO4. Do love me some guns!” He also wrote, “Hammer, brick, gun.” On Feb. 14, 2018, he tweeted this at Sen. Rob Portman: “@robportman hey rob. How much did they pay you to look the other way? 17 kids are dead. If not now, when?” That was the date of the mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida… He used language often used by Antifa, exclaiming that he wants to “kill every fascist.” He also liked and commented on posts expressing support for the group. “#2016ElectionIn3Words This is bad,” he wrote on Nov. 8, 2016. “You can’t kill 50+ people and injure 600(!) In 10 minutes with cigarettes my dude,” he wrote in 2017. In response to a Buzzfeed story that read, “Virginia has declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the “Unite the Right” rally anniversary in Charlottesville this weekend,” he wrote: “Kill every fascist.” Betts was a politically active socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. On the Twitter page, Connor Betts indicated he’d vote for Elizabeth Warren for president but not Kamala Harris, responding to a person’s tweet suggesting they be co-presidents. “Nahh, but only cuz Harris is a cop – Warren I’d happily vote for,” he wrote. ‌ He responded to a person’s tweet that read “if you nominate anyone other than sanders, you’re going to lose” by writing, “I think Warren has a decent shot, as well.” Some of his tweets referred to guns. He was a fan of “The Squad,” Including Rep. Ocasio Cortez and Rep. Omar. He shared an article that criticized Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi for not supporting Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and Ayanna Pressley. “Read it,” he wrote. He shared posts about “concentration camps” at the border and wrote, “Cut the fences down. Slice ICE tires. Throw bolt cutters over the fences.” He retweeted a post from another person about stealing from “right wingers” at a Trump rally. This all leaves very little question about who Betts really was. He was absolutely a far leftist. He was not a white supremacist and hated religious people. He repeated antifa, as well as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking points on his social media. He was a global warming enthusiast and an avowed socialist. Every piece of evidence we have points to his radicalization coming via the left, not the right. To be clear, my personal opinion is that the shooter is responsible here. It’s a dangerous game to try to play “pin the blame on the politician” when someone crazy does something evil. But this is the game the Democrats and media are demanding we play. We’ve been bombarded with op-eds and posts the past 24 hours blaming Trump and Republicans for these shootings. That’s a road that goes both ways and it’s fairly clear the Dayton shooter was radicalized by the politics of Democrats and Antifa. Now that we’ve learned all this, you can expect the media to stop talking about this particular shooting and focus solely on the El Paso shooting. Why? Because this isn’t about actual care for victims. It’s about disgusting politics. It’s going to be fascinating to watch media focus solely on the El Paso shooter now that we know the Dayton shooter was a leftist who was a big fan of Elizabeth Warren and the AOC “squad.” — RBe (@RBPundit) August 4, 2019 Enjoying the read?

        "articles": "It’s been stunning to watch this election season going back to last July when Donald Trump entered the race. Many people (myself included) laughed. There wasn’t anybody who took him seriously or thought he had a shot (Yeah that includes you, Joe Scarborough). He was a joke and his mouth was going to end his campaign fast. It never did. Not matter what he said. Whenever he said something jaw dropping crazy, everybody said, “Ok, he’s done. That’s going to knock him out of the race.” It never did. A strange thing happened as all of this went on. His supporters became emboldened by his antics. So much so they didn’t care what he said. He was not part of “the establishment” and therefore they were ok with some of the things he said. If they weren’t ok with it, they would excuse in part saying, “At least he says what’s on his mind.” That’s part of the problem, but I digress. Trump supporters quickly morphed into Trump lackeys and Trump apologists. Before long, nothing negative could be said about him without incurring the wrath of people screaming, veins popping in their foreheads and spittle flying out of their mouths as they would scream at you to get in line. Things just got progressively worse. Now that he has the nomination, things have been amped up for sure so here are five ways Trump supporters behave as though they are part of a cult: 1. Donald Trump can do no wrong – There is an excuse for him for everything. Everything. No matter what he says. No matter how outrageous it is, he can do no wrong. Ever. Take a step back to when Greg Gutfeld called out Eric Bolling after Donald Trump used the word “schlonged” to say what happened to Hillary Clinton against Barack Obama in 2008. Trump defenders say the term had nothing to do with the male anatomy and Bolling tried to defend it: 2. Trump supporters don’t care about his flip-flops and inconsistencies – They simply do not care. Trump said he advocated for a ban on all Muslims coming into the country. They he changed his view and said a total ban wasn’t needed. We just needed to be more careful. He then lied saying he never said he supported a total ban. When confronted with this obvious flip-flop and then lying about it, a Trump supporter said to be directly, “So what?” He didn’t care. Trump wasn’t an “insider” and “he had to do things” in order to stay ahead of everybody else. It’s amazing how they could support Trump when they claim the reason they support him his because they’re tired of politicians lying to them. 3. Trump is supported by supposed “constitutional conservatives” but ignore his liberal policies – A good number of Trump supporters are Tea Party cranks who see any kind of incremental win as total capitulation to Obama and his leftist agenda. They are running around right now freaking out over Paul Ryan who has refused to say he’ll back Trump at this point. What are Trump supporters doing? Attacking Ryan as a “leftist establishment” who needs to be thrown out of office. Meanwhile, Trump is telling people he thinks Ryan’s agenda isn’t welcome by him because he’s in the Republican Party not the “conservative party.” Meanwhile, Donald Trump refuses to do anything about Medicare or Social Security. He’s open to raising the minimum wage, raising taxes, trade protectionism and single payer healthcare. But Paul Ryan is the liberal. 4. People react to Trump like high school girls did with The Beatles. While it may be understandable for teenage girls to have gone wild over the mop-tops from Liverpool, watching grown women freak out over the Duck Tail from Queens is somewhat embarrassing. Look at these photos: Thank you Lord Jesus? Seriously? Donald Trump is merely a man. He’s running for President. He’s a politician. 5. The Trump “hero worship” art is the most obvious sign we’re dealing with a cult-like figure. This is something seen all the time. A cult figure is often photoshopped into classic images or even modern day art with historical figures. Here are some: Trump has a strong online fan base of anti-Semites who love imagining him as the next fuhrer. Trumps nativist and racist followers will use terms like “invasion” and as the picture below shows, “foreign hordes.” All of which is code for “Mexicans.” The final one takes the cake. Here is Trump, standing in the middle of a PARTED SEA with adoring fans, flags and US fighter jets all in the same image. I am sure Trump fans will see this and get mad at me. Don’t. Remember, it was Trump himself who said he could shoot somebody in the middle of the street and his supporters wouldn’t care. He’s your guy. You deal with it. ",

        "articles": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. walks back to his office after speaking on the Senate floor on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 10, 2019. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. walks back to his office after speaking on the Senate floor on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 10, 2019. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has now released the resolution for the rules of the impeachment trial and it’s not going to make Democrats happy. The rules clearly show that McConnell is not messing around. He doesn’t intend to have any protracted trial and it sounds like he has an ace in the hole when it comes to witnesses in terms of stopping any nonsense. \u0010First, any motions that are going to be made must be made by tomorrow by 11 a.m., excluding any motions for witnesses or documents. Then following the disposition of those motions on Wednesday, the trial will begin in earnest. From Daily Wire: “Following the disposition of such motions, or if no motions are made, then the House of Representatives shall make its presentation in support of the articles of impeachment for a period of time not to exceed 24 hours, over up to 2 session days,” the resolution continued. “Following the House of Representatives’ presentation, the President shall make his presentation for a period not to exceed 24 hours, over up to 2 session days. Each side may determine the number of persons to make its presentation.” “Upon the conclusion of the President’s presentation, Senators may question the parties for a period of time not to exceed 16 hours,” the resolution continued. “Upon the conclusion of questioning by the Senate, there shall be 4 hours of argument by the parties, equally divided, followed by deliberation by the Senate, if so ordered under the impeachment rules, on the question of whether it shall be in order to consider and debate under the impeachment rules any motion to subpoena witnesses or documents. The Senate, without any intervening action, motion, or amendment, shall then decide by the yeas and nays whether it shall be in order to consider and debate under the impeachment rules any motion to subpoena witnesses or documents.” “Following the disposition of that question, other motions provided under the impeachment rules shall be in order,” the resolution concluded. “If the Senate agrees to allow either the House of Representatives or the President to subpoena witnesses, the witnesses shall first be deposed and the Senate shall decide after deposition which witnesses shall testify, pursuant to the impeachment rules. No testimony shall be admissible in the Senate unless the parties have had an opportunity to depose such witnesses.” Then comes the vote to convict or acquit on each of the articles of impeachment after deliberation by the Senate. What this means is that it’s not going to be a long, drawn-out process, there’s already a cap on time, this is why they previously were talking about possibly two weeks. That’s great because theoretically it could have been dismissed out of hand, just on legal ground for failure to state a case. But that would have been viewed perhaps as trying to cover it up. This way, it can be concluded as an absolute acquittal. Also Democrats wouldn’t get to play these games with the witnesses, because they’ll be deposed first to see if they are at all relevant to the case and then the Senate will decide whether to have them testify. That would prevent an “Amb. Maria Yovanovitch” situation where you have a person who really had nothing to do with the issue there just to smear the President. Democrats are supposed to be making their case now, not scrambling for more witnesses to prove it, that’s already supposed to have been done. It’s not the Senate’s obligation to ameliorate their failures. If. as they claim, they have an “overwhelming case” then they shouldn’t need any more witnesses. The only reason they want them is because they know they don’t have a good case. ",

        "articles": "In a shocking example of a politician doing exactly what he said he would do, Pat McCrory, governor of North Carolina, signed House Bill 2, aptly named the Public Facilities Private and Security Act. The bill bans individuals from using public restrooms or locker rooms that do not correspond with the sex they were born into. It also reserves the right to pass nondiscrimination legislation to the state government, preempting any local ordinances. The bill is in response to a Charlotte, NC nondiscrimination ordinance that passed with a vote of 7 – 4 last month, which allowed access to public restrooms for those who claimed transgender status. Similar ordinances have been considered or passed in California, Texas, and Virginia. Governor McCrory had promised before the passing of the Charlotte ordinance that were it to pass, the state would intervene on behalf of the citizens. True to his word and in a move sure to score points with conservatives in the state for his reelection bid, McCrory called for a special session of the NC General Assembly, and House Bill 2 was passed, with a bipartisan vote of 82 – 26 in the House of Representatives, and a vote of 32 – 0 in the state Senate. During the proceedings, Senate Democrats walked out of the assembly, rather than vote on the bill. The bill was then rushed to Governor McCrory’s desk for his approval. In approving the bill, McCrory stated: “Charlotte’s ordinance was not only overreaching, it defied common sense and basic norms, allowing a man to use a woman’s bathroom, shower and locker room, for instance. That’s why tonight, I signed bipartisan legislation to stop this breach of privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect April 1.” Predictably, the move has prompted howls of disapproval from Democrats, the ACLU, and Caitlyn Jenner, because, of course, Caitlyn Jenner’s voice matters in North Carolina politics. McCrory’s Democrat opponent in the upcoming election is North Carolina Attorney General, Roy Cooper. Cooper’s statement on the passing of the bill expressed concerns about discrimination, and how it would affect the state economy (which has taken an upturn since the seating of the first Republican governor in NC since James G. Martin left office in January of 1993): “That North Carolina is making discrimination part of the law is shameful. It will not only cause real harm to families, but to our economy as well. We have seen how this played out when Indiana tried it — businesses left the state, or thought twice about bringing in new jobs, and millions of dollars in revenue was lost.” What protesters of the bill neglect to mention is the involvement of LGBT Chamber of Commerce president, Chad Sevearance-Turner. As well as being a key supporter of the bathroom ordinance, he is also a registered sex offender. In a March 9, 2016 write-up from The Charlotte Observer: Sevearance-Turner was arrested in 1998, when he was 20, and charged in Cherokee County, S.C., with a “lewd act, committing or attempting a lewd act upon a child under 16.” A 2000 story in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal said Sevearance-Turner had been a youth minister at a church in Gaffney. A jury there found him guilty of fondling a 15-year-old teenage church member while the boy slept. McCrory is up for his first reelection bid since winning the seat in 2012. In his time in office, he has courted jobs, slashed the personal tax rate, and signed off on ending Common Core in North Carolina classrooms. November will tell if he has struck the right chord with voters, or if he’ll fall victim to the wider unrest present at the national level within the GOP ranks. ",

        "articles": "The U.S. Attorney’s Office released a statement Friday revealing details of a Las Vegas security guard’s arrest. The 23-year-old’s been “charged by a criminal complaint with one count of possession of an unregistered firearm – namely, the component parts of a destructive device.” As per the 11-page criminal complaint lodged against him, the man was allegedly engaged in encrypted communication with those identifying with the National Socialist Movement in order to attack a synagogue in the desert town. Additionally, he may have been surveilling an LGBTQ-friendly bar for nefarious reasons. What’s the NSM all about? According to the District of Nevada Attorney’s Office, it’s this: Members believe in the superiority of the white race and have a common goal of challenging the established laws, social order, and government via terrorism and other violent acts. Tampa Bay’s ABC Action News reports that the Las Vegas Joint Terrorism Task Force began investigating the man in April, after it was learned he was messaging with neo-Nazi organization Atomwaffen Division. The guy’s got uncanny taste in friends. During a search, officials discovered “a notebook with several hand-drawn schematics for a potential Las Vegas-area attack.” Also drawn: “timed explosive devises.” Yeah — this guy could use an intervention. It just keeps getting worse — in his bedroom, law enforcement found bomb parts and explosive-friendly chemicals. Bonus: an “AR-15-style rifle and a bolt-action rifle.” Definitely intervention material. The guns were impounded. Here’s what FBI Las Vegas Division Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse had to say about all this: “The FBI’s Las Vegas Joint Terrorism Task Force is committed to protecting our community from any threat of domestic terrorism and I could not be more proud of the work they did in this case. … As this complaint illustrates, the FBI will always be proactive to combat threats that cross a line from free speech to potential violence.” Assuming the charges are accurate, thank God agencies intercepted the man and his efforts. We could’ve been soon reading about the death and destruction he caused. Instead, we’re finding out he faces up to a decade in prison. Law enforcement took care of business. Surely right now, there are other would-be terrorists. As George W. Bush directed after 9/11, we must stay vigilant. Observe and report. For most every evil deed, I believe, there were signs not taken seriously enough to prevent it. But the citizens of Las Vegas can sleep a little bit more soundly tonight, knowing an armed and dangerous aspiring assassin is behind bars. Now are you ready to see the guy? He already made the headlines, back in 2016.

        "articles": "After reading this article, you’ll understand why I feel rather good about my refusal to ever embrace Black Lives Matter as many Republican politicians did last summer, marching under their banner and repeating their slogan. With the ongoing protests in Cuba against the communist dictatorship and its oppression, the silence from many on the left has been noticeable. While you’ve gotten cowardly notes of “support” from the establishment, usually blaming COVID or economic issues for the unrest, other “social justice warriors” like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley have simply said nothing. Yet, their favorite grifting, racist organization has finally spoken out, and it’s one of the more horrific statements I’ve ever read on a political matter. Black Lives Matter has released a statement on Cuba: pic.twitter.com/NgnT1o1oZE — Sabrina Rodríguez (@sabrod123) July 15, 2021 Does BLM speak out for the dissidents who are pushing back against a murderous communist government after generations of oppression and turmoil that has caused so much suffering? Nah. Instead, they actually show support for the communists, claiming that they have shown “solidarity” with oppressed peoples of “African descent.” They then go on to use the harboring of a convicted cop-killer as an example of the greatness of the Cuban dictatorship. Of course, even the idea that the communists aren’t racist is false as that’s still the predominant position in the government there. Every “black liberation” movement the Cuban government has supported has been for political reasons. But just in case you weren’t assured yet that BLM is a garbage, racist, Marxist organization that supports atrocities committed around the world, they go on to name who the real bad guy is in all this — the United States. Yes, you guessed it. It’s our fault that the Cuban communists are tyrannical psychopaths because we have an embargo that stops the communist government from trading with us. Of course, that embargo doesn’t stop Cuba from trading with hundreds of other countries, making the talking point that it is the sole reason for Cuba’s misery rather suspect. Regardless, Cubans aren’t chanting for more American imports. Rather, they are chanting for freedom and liberty after having suffered for decades under a communist regime that disallows them to pursue their own prosperity and happiness, whether we are talking financially or physically. BLM trying to spin it as an economic issue, asserting that the communists are really the good guys, is just disgusting. And you know what? It’s long past time for a reckoning. Corporations across the world embraced this awful organization. They painted its logo on their merchandise and sports fields. They donated tens of millions of dollars that have mostly vanished into the ether. They insinuated their own customers were racists for not bowing before the predominant narrative they were pushing. The same is true for politicians and their media allies. Mitt Romney marched with BLM protesters. The State Department flew the BLM flag and hung their banners at our embassies. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris fluffed the organization as a necessary voice. News anchors took to the air to denounce anyone who didn’t agree with and spread BLM’s propaganda far and wide. Meanwhile, those of us who stood up and pointed out the Marxist founding of BLM, the anti-American trash on their website, and the fact that they were a divisive, harmful aspect of our culture were called racists. In the end, though, my conscience is clear, and anyone who supported BLM needs to be made to answer for what that organization is now proudly broadcasting it is. Front-page contributor for .

        "articles": "This has been a big news day, with a lot of great things happening. But definitely the biggest news has to be the decision I reported on earlier today, the decision by the DOJ to drop its case against Gen. Michael Flynn. From AP: The Justice Department said it had concluded that Flynn’s interview by the FBI was “untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Flynn” and that the interview on January 24, 2017 was “conducted without any legitimate investigative basis.” [….] “Through the course of my review of General Flynn’s case, I concluded the proper and just course was to dismiss the case,” Jensen said in a statement. “I briefed Attorney General Barr on my findings, advised him on these conclusions, and he agreed.” This was after Jensen investigated the case and, in the process, the DOJ found handwritten FBI notes that showed the effort to trap Flynn during his interview: “What’s our goal? Truth/admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?” the official wrote. Documents also dropped tying Barack Obama into the effort against Flynn as well, showing in a meeting on Jan. 5, that he was aware of the call with the Russian Ambassador and that he informed former deputy Attorney General Sally Yates about it with former FBI Director James Comey. From Townhall: “After the briefing, Obama dismissed the group but asked Yates and Comey to stay behind. Obama started by saying he had ‘learned of the information about Flynn’ and his conversation with Kislyak about sanctions. Obama specified he did not want any additional information on the matter, but was seeking information on whether the White House should be treating Flynn any differently, given the information. At that point, Yates had no idea what the President was talking about, but figured it out based on the conversation. Yates recalled Comey mentioning the Logan Act, but can’t recall if he specified there was an ‘investigation,’” it continues. Now, in spite of all the efforts against him, despite years of legal fees depleting his funds, Flynn has always kept the hope alive that truth would out. After the documents about the effort to trap him were finally revealed last week, he posted this image. pic.twitter.com/Q833u4Is8h — General Flynn (@GenFlynn) April 29, 2020 Now, what he posted tonight says it all.

        "articles": "It has not even been one day, Journos; try showing a modicum of self-respect. While we knew it was probable, the media reaction to the Joe Biden inaugural has been a parade of cloying adulation, with a smattering of concentrated levels of derangement. What has been revealing in all of this is how this change in power has seen numerous players in the media landscape completely abandon any pretense of objectivity. If there is any surprise to be found it is not in the fawning praise but in the hubris of doing so in this collective fashion. So gird yourself now and you will be served a heaping serving of saccharine coverage, with occasional doses of acidic snark, on the side. Anderson Cooper – ‘’It’s a new beginning. To not have President Trump, the name Trump in our heads 24 hours a day is going to be a big adjustment, and something I think a lot of people in this country welcome…” Brian Wiliams – ”And 30 minutes ago power has slipped from the grasp of a twice-impeached private citizen in Florida.” Jake Tapper – “A fitting end to the Trump presidency. A speech full of puffery and lies, although, of course, with this president, it always could have been worse.” Jill Filipovic – “Finally I can unclench my jaw and exhale.’’ Chuck Todd – “He imploded in his inability to accept the loss. So he slinked away. I would argue that might be the biggest favor he’s done for the country and for Joe Biden today.” Dieter Bohn (The Verge) – “I feel weird. Is this relief? Is that a feeling that people used to have?” Alisyn Camerota – “It does feel like today, somehow, reality won. And we didn’t know that reality was going to win. I mean, it was in a mortal combat death struggle for a long time. But today, reality won.” Bianna Golodryga (on the uniform facemask wearing) – ‘’It’s a “symbolic message for the country and the world: America has embraced reality and science.” Lydia Polgreen: “No, I’m not crying at how normal this all is, you are crying.” Ron Brownstein – ‘’More surprising how strongly he called out the threat to democracy Trump unleashed. Suggests drawing a new dividing line: those who do & don’t believe in the American system with Trump on the other side.” Max Boot – ‘’Good riddance.’’ Abby Phillip – “It was an invitation, not just to reach across the aisle, but to get back on track. It was an invitation to decency, to civility.’’ Dana Bash (as Trump departed the White House) – “He looks small. He just looks like a small man.” This is all basically summed up in this fashion: The media who promised us 4 years of oppression are relieved the never-arriving oppression is over; the same press who sold us on death and misery for the past year now declare it is over in a wisp of ether, and the journalists who called Trump a Nazi rapist terrorist are upset he did not attend a ceremony. The question now becomes — what will these scolds do? You get a sense of their impending struggle based on the latest dispatch from CNN’s Jim Acosta. In his last-gasp attempt to place a coda on his career as White House correspondent, Acosta attempted to badger Trump on his trip to his Florida home. He shouts an accusatory question at the President as he boards Air Force One, is rebuffed from a conversation aboard the plane and is ignored one additional time after they landed in Florida. The next years are going to prove a challenge for the press, who operated with reflexive energy at anything Trump said, did, or proposed. Marveling at everything Joe Biden does will become boring in rapid fashion. Resident media-basher, while also covering politics as well as the business side of Show Business.

        "articles": "Egyptian women wearing \"Niqab\" line up outside a polling station to vote in the second round of a referendum on a disputed constitution drafted by Islamist supporters of President Mohammed Morsi in Giza, Egypt, Saturday, Dec. 22, 2012. (AP Photo/Amr Nabil) The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the organization that recently hosted Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) as their keynote speaker, contains leadership that had reportedly expressed vile wishes in the past that include the desire that Hitler was still alive and murdering Jewish people. According to a discovery by Alpha News, in 2008 the Government Affairs Coordinator of Minnesota’s CAIR chapter, Abubakar Osman, posted his desire for the German dictator who tortured and murdered millions of Jewish people to still be alive to increase the number past 6 million. “i wish hitler was alive to f*** up the jewish ppl and add more jewish causalities to the 6 million he killed in the holocaust…,” wrote Osman. The post itself has been deleted, and only screenshots of it remain. It cannot be wholly confirmed whether or not Osman posted this. However, Osman has expressed antisemitic views quite recently. Regardless, it would appear that Osman and those he surrounds himself with still continue to have a very antisemitic viewpoint. As highlighted by Islamist watch, other members of the Minnesota CAIR branch express antisemitic views openly, including their avid support of Omar who has consistently found herself in hot water after expressing antisemitic views: Other CAIR Minnesota officials include board member Abdul Basit, who has claimed that those who “plot” against Bernie Sanders do so because they are Jewish. Few readers will not have read last month about the furor over Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar’s comments about pro-Israel groups and their purported power over American politics. Many considered her remarks anti-Semitic. Rather unsurprisingly, CAIR Minnesota, the Muslim American Society and their anti-Jewish officials are devoted supporters of the Congresswoman. This antisemitism appears to have worked its way well into Minnesota politics according to Alpha News, as the Muslim American Society of Minnesota (MAS) leader Asad Zaman also has close ties with various Minnesota politicians, including Omar. This leader has expressed highly antisemitic views, including apologies for terrorists and the spread of antisemitic conspiracy theories: The MAS Minnesota branch is led by a man named Asad Zaman. Zaman has made it clear through numerous Facebook posts that he holds anti-Semitic attitudes. He has openly expressed apologies for Hamas and supported war criminals as well. Some of the links he has shared on Facebook lead to holocaust denial websites, and anti-Semitic conspircy theory sites that claim that “U.S. foreign policy is determined by Israel.” Zaman met with Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) in early during the National Muslim Advocacy Day organzied by the United States Coalition of Muslim Organizations (USCMO). Zaman’s group, MAS, is apart of the council of the USCMO. Later, on Apr 3, Zaman delivered the Invocation at the State of the State address delivered by Governor Tim Walz. “These three faith leaders understand the meaning of One Minnesota—and they are practicing what they preach,” said Walz, but it’s clear that based on Senior Editor.

Chuck Grassley laid down some logic and called out Christine Blasey Ford’s attorney’s blatant stall tactic in an email response to their statement that they wouldn’t supply documents requested until Blasey was interviewed by the FBI. BREAKING: New SenGrassley letter to Ford legal team regarding dispute over turning over evidence. pic.twitter.com/5NRnaM6ozA — Shannon Bream (@ShannonBream) October 5, 2018 Grassley writes: “I am writing in response to my letter dated October 2. You said that Dr. Ford is willing to turn her documents over to the FBI, but my request of you was not for documents to be turned over to the FBI. I asked you to provide the documents to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Your response on behalf of your client is a non-sequitur. The Constitution charges the Senate with advising the president on his nomination. Senators have a constitutional obligation to investigate and evaluate independently the President’s nominees. Our obligation is unrelated to anything the FBI does. That’s why we don’t just vote on nominees after the president loans us the FBI background investigation. We have to make our own assessment. The U.S. Senate does not control the FBI. If you have an objection to how the FBI conducts its investigations, take it up with Director Wray. But don’t raise that objection as a reason not to respond to this Committee’s demand for relevant evidence. The FBI’s investigation decisions aren’t our concern. Even if the FBI never interviews Dr. Ford, or interviews her 10 times, this committee has a constitutional obligation to investigate Dr. Ford’s allegations, and that’s what we’ve been doing since we became aware of her allegations. It’s not even clear to me what purpose turning over these materials to the FBI would accomplish. The FBI would simply turn over that evidence to the Senate. That is precisely the outcome I seek with this request. You have claimed repeatedly that the evidence I have requested supports Dr. Ford’s allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. She even provided some of the evidence to national news… Indeed, if the evidence supported your client’s allegations, you surely would produce it as quickly as you could. But you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate. In doing so, you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr. Ford’s allegations. I don’t know what other inference we should derive from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr. Ford’s allegations in quite the way you have claimed. I urge you once again, now for the third time in writing, to turn over the therapy notes, polygraph materials, and communications with The Washington Post that Dr. Ford has relied upon as evidence. In addition to the evidence I requested in my October 2 letter, in light of recently uncovered information, please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect communications between Dr. Ford or her representatives and any of the following: (1) U.S. Senators or their staffs, particularly the offices of Senators Feinstein and Hirono, other than your communications with me and my staff in preparation for the September 27 hearing; (2) the alleged witnesses identified by Dr. Ford (Leland Keyser, Mark Judge, and Patrick “P.J.” Smith); and (3) Debbie Ramirez, Julie Swetnick, or their representatives. Sincerely, Chuck Grassley” Emphasis added. Uh, yeah. Grassley has clearly had it with the nonsense and stall tactics from the Blasey Ford team. Enough is enough. It’s time to vote. ",

        "articles": "Nearly everyone in DC – Left, Center and Right – is working as hard as possible to as rapidly as possible erase Donald Trump from history. DC wants everyone to forget Trump’s exposure of their $5-trillion-a-year corrupt graft racket. So DC can get back to their $5-trillion-a-year corrupt graft racket – completely unencumbered by Trump’s spotlight and opposition. DC wants to get back to getting bribed by Big Business to allow nigh unlimited foreigners to come in and take blue collar gigs from We the People. DC wants to get back to getting bribed by Big Tech to allow nigh unlimited foreigners to come in and take white collar gigs from We the People. And DC wants to get back to being bribed by…everyone in the US except We the People – to return to shipping hundreds of millions of jobs out of the US. Via DCs woefully awful globalist fake “free trade.” To which DC has subjected us for decades. Strong Support for Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority NAFTA Was a Bipartisan Effort Bipartisan Agreement Gives Trade Pact a Boost Exit Trump – Reenter the Globalists. Trump Trade: DC Needs to Do Just About Everything Differently DC Globalists Are Already Trying to Reverse Trump’s Massively Successful Trade Policies Exit America First – Reenter America Last. America Last trade means…: “Lots of tariffs on our stuff – with little or no reciprocal tariffs from US. “Lots of import limits on our stuff – with little or no reciprocal limits from US…. “Lots of countries mass-subsidize lots of their exports. Which artificially lowers the mass-subsidized exports’ prices when they hit the global market.” All of which makes it nigh impossible to keep in the US businesses and the jobs they provide. If you stay, you get very limited, highly tariffed access to comparatively tiny foreign markets. If you leave, you get unlimited, un-tariffed access to the US’s world’s-largest-market – and you get subsidized by foreign governments to boot. US businesses have found it nigh impossible to compete against all of this. And since they can’t beat it – they join it. They have left the country by the tens of millions. Stupid Trade Policy Isn’t the Only Reason We Lose Jobs – But It’s a Big One DC likes to pretend the many decades of this America Last nonsense is “free trade.” Trump’s Attacks on Free Trade Beware the Trump Trade Trap Trump’s Dangerous Free Trade Policies Trade Wars: The Collapse of America’s Free Trade Consensus Bipartisan Support for Free Trade Has Been Left Behind When of course decades’ worth of DCs “free trade” – has been the fakest of fake “free trade.” And it has cost us hundreds of millions of jobs. Lower Wage Americans LOVE Fair Trade and Rigid Immigration Enforcement So very few of us are willing to point out the DC Fake “Free Trade” Emperor is stark naked. Leftist organization Public Citizen does so. And they’ve just issued a report chronicling some of the dumbness of DC’s fake “free trade.” Unfortunately, they’re Leftist. So of course they, unfortunately, have to put everything through a racist, dishonest prism. Even when the Left is right – they do it wrong. Trade Discrimination “The disproportionate, underreported damage to U.S. Black and Latino workers from U.S. trade policies…. “The damage caused by the corporate-led hyper-globalization that has been implemented over the past decades by ‘trade’ agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and NAFTA-style free trade agreements (FTAs) has been well documented — from mass job offshoring to unreliable supply chains to downward pressure on wages to weakened consumer and environmental protections. “In his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump hijacked progressives’ critique of corporate globalization and job offshoring, but reframed it into a narrative of resentment with racialized appeals to target white working-class voters.” Of course Trump did neither of these things. Here’s Trump in 1988 on The Oprah Winfrey Show – saying the exact same thing about fake “free trade” then as he did in 2016 and does now. And Trump promised his policies – trade and otherwise – would help blacks and Hispanics too. Remember “What the hell do you have to lose?” He ran on fixing trade – not fixing white-working-class trade. Public Citizen’s racist report reports: “‘Black workers have lost nearly half a million manufacturing jobs (494,000) during the NAFTA-WTO era,’ the report says, while Latinos lost 123,000 jobs in the decline of the U.S. appliance and equipment industries, and 182,700 jobs from textiles, apparel and leather manufacturing. “And those workers are also overrepresented in many of the service sector jobs that have been sent overseas, it adds, like call center and customer service jobs.” Well Trump changed DC trade – and many, many other America Last policies. How’d Blacks and Hispanics do as a result? Trump’s Economy Is Historically Good for Minorities Celebrating the Rise of Minority-Owned Businesses Black and Hispanic Unemployment Is at a Record Low Minority Women Are Winning the Jobs Race in a Record Economic Expansion Oh look – women too. Black Workers’ Wages Are Finally Rising Hispanics Flourishing in Trump Economy Blacks and Hispanics seemed to know to whom to give the credit – and their votes. Why Trump Won a Larger Share of the Black Vote in 2020 Trump’s Gains with Hispanic Voters Should Prompt Some Progressive Rethinking Leftists aren’t the only ones who should be rethinking things regarding Trump. The DC Republican Establishment specifically – and DC generally – shouldn’t be erasing Trump and his policies. They should all be embracing them. But that would cost all of them a LOT of coin, so….

        "articles": "On the eve of DNI Dan Coats stepping down, we got a rash of declassifications dealing with the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s illegal email server. As with all things dealing with this topic, it’s complicated and can be hard to follow. But we aren’t dealing with anonymous sources or speculation here. These are actual documents that have just been declassified. Perhaps this dump shows President Trump is keeping his promise on that front? Brian Cates (Epoch Times) laid out exactly what we are seeing in a lengthy thread that I’m not going to fully post here. I’d suggest you go read it to get the full picture. I’ll do my best to summarize and highlight the major revelations though. So what changed today? Documentation was released that verifies these anonymously sourced prior news accounts.  — Brian Cates //Flynn & Breitbart's Army! (@drawandstrike) August 15, 2019 It's not an unverified rumor coming from an anonymous source at this point. The documentary evidence has just been made public.  — Brian Cates //Flynn & Breitbart's Army! (@drawandstrike) August 15, 2019 Essentially, the FBI found in the metadata that every email sent and received on Clinton’s home brew server was being copied to an email address registered to a Chinese company named Carter Heavy Industries. Who setup this email address? We now know the answer to that. So a ton of classified info that Clinton deliberately put in emails on an unsecured server were ALL being sent to this CarterHeavyIndustries [CHI] email account, and then forwarded from there to a PRN server. — Brian Cates //Flynn & Breitbart's Army! (@drawandstrike) August 15, 2019 Paul Combetta was Hillary’s IT specialist and he was inexplicably given blanket immunity by James Comey’s FBI during the Hillary email investigation. This despite the fact that he clearly broke the law and apparently had absolutely nothing of substance to offer investigators. Typically, you don’t give immunity to someone who can’t help you land a bigger fish. But as most reading this know, nothing about the Hillary email investigation made sense. It was clearly ran as a whitewash operation of any possible criminal activity. These new documents further establish that, as we see James Comey and Peter Strzok actively suppressed the evidence in question. In fact, the only reason we are finding out about this is because the Inspector General filed a supplemental report to fill in gaps left in the original IG report on the Hillary investigation. Here's the question that was asked years ago but never received an answer: What kind of security clearance did Paul Combetta have? 🤔 If he has NO SECURITY CLEARANCE, & Clinton's emails are chock full of classified information & he's copying it all….? — Brian Cates //Flynn & Breitbart's Army! (@drawandstrike) August 15, 2019 The excuse being given by some defenders is that Combetta made the email account so that means it was just an account to archive Clinton’s emails. That leaves way too many questions unanswered and makes little sense. Why **DID** Combetta pick **that name** for the 'dummy email account' on the PRN server where he was archiving all of the emails – many of which remember are CLASSIFIED – from Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State? — Brian Cates //Flynn & Breitbart's Army! (@drawandstrike) August 15, 2019 If you want to setup a dummy account, why are you using a Chinese company as the domain? The first thought would be to ask if Combetta was being paid off by the Chinese to forward the emails to them. That’s probably the least controversial explanation though. If Clinton herself was involved in the distribution of the materials, things would really escalate. The IG came up inconclusive, unable to pin down exactly the provenance and purpose of the Chinese email address. What we do know is that the FBI leadership at the time glossed over the evidence and essentially buried it. Past that, even if we are to believe that Combetta picked the name at random, it means he broke the law by illegally archiving classified government documents. Of course, we all know Combetta was not acting alone. Hillary Clinton was his boss and had to have been directing him to do these things. What that points to is the magical intent that James Comey claimed didn’t exist (intent wasn’t actually required in the criminal statute regardless). There’s a lot more in Cates’ thread and I’d again encourage you to read through it. This entire ordeal is just a mess and from what’s being rumored, it’s not over. Bill Barr is on record saying John Huber, who is part of the investigation into all this, is looking at the question of the 33,000 emails Clinton illegally destroyed. It’s been said a million times and I’ll say it once more. If this were anyone but Hillary Clinton, they’d be in jail by now. Enjoying the read?

        "articles": "A growing number of Americans don’t respect the nation’s top cop or his authoritah (FreeMartyG) A WhiteHouse.gov petition urging President Trump to fire U.S. Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions “for all the obvious reasons” is bringing in thousands of digital signatures within hours of appearing online and new signatures are being accepted here. Sessions has been overruled by the President on his proposed cannabis crackdown, recused by his own order on the so-called “Russia investigation,” largely silent on the alleged crime of Clintons, and now his department is failing to answer congressional subpoenas. Now, the man who many contend has been acting as the head human shield standing in between Hillary and a possible 30,000+ count felony indictment has found a new place at the White House – on the front page of its petition website. And at the time of writing, FreeMartyG is currently conducting polls asking if Sessions is helping to protect Hillary Clinton from justice. You can vote on Twitter here or Facebook here. Meanwhile, a separate petition asking House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) to introduce articles of impeachment against Federal Judge Kimba Wood, who has been overseeing the legal files seized from President Trump’s longtime lawyer Michael Cohen and who forced him to list his clients publicly in open court, has also been bringing in thousands of signatures and new signatures can be submitted here. Previous polling conducted by FreeMartyG via its Twitter and Facebook pages indicated nearly unanimous approval for the impeachment of the Manhattan U.S. district court judge due to her failure to recuse herself from the Cohen hearings despite numerous ties to the Clintons, including her role officiating the 2014 wedding ceremony of billionaire Democratic mega-donor George Soros who in turn gave $10.5 million to Hillary’s failed 2016 presidential campaign. And those polls closed before FreeMartyG revealed that Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, John Podesta, had been keeping a list of judges’ contact info which included Judge Wood’s official email address. FreeMartyG previously submitted federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests seeking emails between Podesta and Wood as well as Podesta and the other judges on the list and Lyn Hardy, Special Counsel for Freedom of Information & Privacy Acts, responded that she would “neither confirm nor deny the existence of any such records…” Again, the petition to #FireSessions can be signed at WhiteHouse.gov here and the petition to impeach Federal Judge Kimba Wood can be signed here.

        "articles": "There is no one in American public life, other than Barack Obama, that has cultivated their victimhood more than Hillary Clinton. That is her response to everything. Whether it is blaming a Vast Right Wing Conspiracy for Bill Clinton flinging bodily fluids on White House staff or calling out her legions of flying monkeys and harpies to flog the hapless Rick Lazio, Hillary Clinton has relied upon the cult of victimhood for protection. Quite honestly, the only reason Clinton lost the nomination in 2008 was because she could not come up with a scenario where a wealthy, privileged, white, female kleptocrat was more oppressed than a privileged half-black Marxist. Now she is trying out this particular shoe on Bernie Sanders to see if it will fit. In the Democrat “debate” there was this exchange: When Hillary tried to talk over Bernie Sanders he gave told her, “Excuse me, I’m talking.” Sanders hadn’t even had time to finish his thought before Hillary Clinton’s butt-remoras were already out in full force: Clinton getting a good dry run tonight for a fall debate against a dismissive, mocking male candidate hitting her on trade and Wall Street. — Nick Confessore (@nickconfessore) March 7, 2016 If you are wondering, Confessore is an unbiased New York Times political reporter. This is nearly Rick Lazio level of bad for Bernie Sanders. He needs a deep breath. — Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) March 7, 2016 McDermott is as Democrat pollster. \"Excuse me I'm talking\" … every woman in America cringed at that one — Michael Cohen (@speechboy71) March 7, 2016 Cohen is a rather dimbulb C-list political columnist for the Boston Globe Every woman watching the #DemDebate cringed when Bernie shushed Hillary this way:  pic.twitter.com/sdse9H3ePC — Mic (@micnews) March 7, 2016 Mic.com is a progressive media outlet that takes dictation from C-list political columnists. Sanders is pushing back against this nonsense: During an intense exchange over the auto industry and Wall Street bailout, Sanders began to say that some of Clinton’s “friends destroyed this economy” before she interrupted. “Excuse me, I’m talking,” Sanders said testily. Clinton aides portrayed the exchange as a slight on par with Rick Lazio’s debate gaffe in Clinton’s 2000 Senate race, but on Monday, Sanders maintained that he didn’t interrupt Clinton, who he noted spoke well past the allotted time 75 seconds to answer questions and 30 seconds for follow-ups. “Did you check how much time Hillary Clinton spoke during the debate? Did you check out how often Hillary Clinton interrupted me?” Sanders said to reporters. “When I was speaking, she interrupted me. I did not interrupt her, despite the fact that she spoke longer,” he continued. “You know, the red lights went on and she kept talking. I didn’t interrupt her. But I think in the middle of a debate if somebody is trying to make a point and somebody else interrupts you, it’s rude.” What Clinton and her followers do is demand that they have it both ways. She wants to be treated as superior to men in every encounter and when anyone has the temerity to challenge her honesty, competence, ideas, or even her lack of good breeding she immediately screams sexism. I think Clinton trotting this crap out in the Democrat primary is going to go a long way towards depriving her of the same tool should she win the Democrat nomination.

        "articles": "Retired Marine General James Mattis, former Secretary of Defense to President Donald Trump, felt it necessary to excoriate his former boss this past Wednesday. Mattis, in a long screed, published in The Atlantic and entitled, “James Mattis Denounces President Trump, Describes Him as a Threat to the Constitution,” said: “I have watched this week’s unfolding events, angry and appalled.” “The words ‘Equal Justice Under Law’ are carved in the pediment of the United States Supreme Court. This is precisely what protesters are rightly demanding. It is a wholesome and unifying demand—one that all of us should be able to get behind. We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers. The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values—our values as people and our values as a nation.” “We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution.” “Mockery of the Constitution,” How so? I keep hearing that phrase, especially regarding the potential use of troops. However, nobody, including General Mattis has described just how President Trump is doing such. Mattis continues, “Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us,” Sorry General. Where were you when he was attacked during the transition and never let up on—while you were serving as his Secretary of Defense? Where were you, when he was being spied upon by the agencies that are supposed to be spying for him and against our foreign enemies—while you were his Secretary of Defense? I’m sorry Sir, but it’s not President Trump who is dividing us. It’s the folks who still won’t accept the results of the 2016 election. It’s the foreign and domestic actors with mayhem in mind, who using the pretext of civil rights, that seek to divide us over an essentially non-existent problem. Mattis follows with “We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.” That sounds a whole lot like a call to remove him from office…and not in legal way. General Mattis needs to walk this back a bit. The last thing we need in these turbulent time is a 7…or 8 days in May scenario. Then, retired Marine Corps General Mattis does something I would never have thought a Flag Officer of serious distinction would ever do, he attempts to pawn an untruth off on the American People by saying (emphasis mine) “When I joined the military, some 50 years ago,” he writes, “I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens—much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.” That is a shameful statement. At no time were American Soldiers ordered to violate anyone’s rights and certainly not to provide any photo op. That just did not happen. General Mattis has a well deserved reputation for being a prolific reader. Perhaps he might consider re-reading the U.S. Constitution and the Insurrection Act with Amendments, which provide President Trump with the authority that he is considering using. One of my Academy classmates reminded me of something that noted history scholar, General Mattis might wish to consider; Presidents Jefferson, Jackson, Grant, Hayes, Cleveland, Wilson, F. Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Kennedy, L. Johnson, and G HW Bush have all invoked the Insurrection Act. Since 1968, it has been invoked 5 times…to quell riots. A couple of my regular readers also noted some pretty egregious uses of the Insurrection Act (Hat tips to JT & MK). 1863-Lincoln used Federal Troops to quell the draft riots. 1919-Wilson used Federal Troops to quell Chicago race riots 1932-Hoover used Federal Troops to disperse World War 1 Veterans who were in Washington peaceably marching to receive their promised bonuses. Then Majors Eisenhower and Patton took part in this under the command of General MacArthur. 1946-Truman sent Federal Troops to disperse striking railway workers. The constitutional basis for President Trump’s proposed but not yet decided, much less, executed action, is long established. Which brings us to the actions in Lafayette Park, where Park Police properly and safely dispersed rioters, criminals who were attacking them. This was not in any way an abuse of power or a case of excessive force, despite a concerted effort by the left to characterize it as such. General Mattis undoubtably retains a clearance, so I’m sure the Park Police and the Secret Service would both be willing to let him read their after-action reports (AAR) regarding the actions in Lafayette Park and also let him review the video. Once he has done this, I believe as an honest man of integrity, would change his opinion.. General Mattis, Sir, you have a reputation for integrity and scholarship. You might not agree with President Trump’s agenda, or his communication style and that’s fair. However, at no time has he violated the rights of American Citizens. At no time has he encouraged my beloved Army or my respected brethren in the Marine Corps to do so. I urge you to “review the tape” and apologize for your intemperate remarks.

        "articles": "Donald Trump appeared on The O’Reilly Factor tonight in what must have marked appearance (including all of the times he has dialed in) number 9,374,384 since last June when Trump announced he was going to seek the GOP Presidential nomination. The Fox News Channel, above all other television stations, including cable and network stations, has been the biggest pimp to Trump’s whoredom since he got into the race. Fox News didn’t just provide Donald Trump a lot of coverage. The personalities who host Fox News shows were happy to throw out any pretense of fairness they had, instead becoming Fox News groupies in the process, fawning over him the way girls did The Beatles when they were on the Ed Sullivan show. What’s more hilarious, is Trump would actually complain about Fox News and in fact, at one point, boycotted the network for several weeks. Did that help? Not at all. Fox News welcomed him back like the mother who insists her crack addicted son who just murdered three people in cold blood is a “good boy.” In doing so, Fox News became the very caricature liberals and others on the left claim they’ve been for the last 20 years. Trump often brags how he has to spend almost no money on ads. I’ve said that Donald Trump is an idiot, but he’s not stupid. And he has played the media like a fiddle, garnering free ad time by just appearing on the networks. Politico looked at this in January: Trump’s new 30-second spot, released Monday morning, was played in its entirety 40 times on the cable news networks between Monday and Tuesday morning, according to POLITICO’s count. Using hour-by-hour prices provided by ad tracking firms for 30-second ads on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC, POLITICO estimated that the 40 airings would have cost Trump $330,000. But that number doesn’t even include the many times all the major channels aired large chunks of the ad. Significant portions of the spot were played at least 20 times in the same period across the cable networks in that same 24-hour period. Though none of the broadcast networks played the full ad in either their blockbuster morning shows or evening news programs, all of them, from NBC’s “Today” to CBS’ “Evening News,” dedicated multiple segments to it, often airing 10- to 15-second clips. MSNBC and Fox News each played the ad 14 times in its entirety between Monday and Tuesday morning. CNN played the ad 12 times in the same time period. On Fox, which dominates the cable ratings, that would amount to about $200,000 in free ad time. The ad, if aired in full during the morning shows and nightly newscasts, would have cost hundreds of thousands more. Trump hasn’t been shy in boasting about his ability to drive media coverage, often tweeting about how his frequent appearances boost TV ratings, while benefiting from unfiltered livestreams of his campaign events. “I’ve spent zero on advertising because you and Fox and all of the others — I won’t mention names, but every other network, I mean they cover me a lot, to put it mildly,” he told Fox News host Neil Cavuto in October. “And in covering me, it’s almost like if I put ads in on top of the program, it would be too much. It would be too much Trump.” There are a number of people who can be called out by name, but I will focus on a few, who have been egregious in their Trump Love (while at the same time denying it): Eric Bolling – The King of Trump Fandom – Bolling has been a complete embarrassment. The worst part about Bolling is that while some hosts are willing to admit they’re aboard the Trump Train, Bolling continues to deny it, claiming he’s being objective the entire time in assessing GOP candidates. It’s a joke. Greg Gutfeld, one of the few Fox News personalities who has not sipped the Kool Aid called out Bolling back in December after Bolling defended Trump’s use of the word “schlonged” towards Hillary Clinton. Watch: Andrea Tantaros – In the dictionary under Trump Fangirl there is a photo of Andrea Tantaros. The only reason she’s not the top rated Trump fan is because she doesn’t have a show all of her own the way Bolling does. There is nothing that escape her lips about Donald Trump that is not positive and once laughingly claimed there were men in this country who saw Trump as their final hope to rescue their manhood. Bill O’Reilly – He of the “No Spin Zone” routinely allows Trump on his show to make completely outrageous claims to which O’Reilly only tepidly responds when if it was any other person, he’d explode in a fit of rage at the thought of somebody trying to BS him. Trump does just that and it’s not hard to imagine O’Reilly sitting their with a fork and a napkin tucked into his shirt enjoying a nice big bowl of Trump’s BS. Fox & Friends – I would say Steve Doocy is the biggest culprit, but it was hard to turn on Fox & Friends at any point (well, it’s hard to watch regardless) since last summer and not hear Donald Trump on the air. From what I have heard (and I haven’t confirmed) is Trump is one of only a handful of people who is allowed to call in to the station to do interviews. Anybody else must be in studio or tied into a remote in order to appear. Trump would normally hit Fox and Friends after one his many disastrous debates or after saying something particularly stupid in order to try and save face. Naturally, he wasn’t challenged. Sean Hannity – I let Andrea Tantaros take second chair to Eric Bolling’s crown as King Fanboy for Trump because I didn’t want to be sexist, but nobody has ruined their reputation more than Hannity in all of this. Hannity has been a fixture at the Fox News Channel since it launched. ‘Hannity and Colmes’ was one of the shows I always used to watch and it was depressing watching him quickly sink into the Trump bog without even putting up a fight. The best part was watching Hannity, who has been a fixture in Republican (not conservative) circles for the last 20 years, talk about “the establishment” and the “ruling class” as if he was only hatched in June of 2015 as a populist. Trump’s appearances on Hannity’s show became so common, people had betting pools on how many times per week Trump would appear. As I mentioned before, Greg Gutfeld is one of the handful of Fox News personalities and news people who are not afraid to call out Trump’s nonsense. Dana Perino is another as is Megyn Kelly. Bret Baier is one of the best journalists on television and has always provided well rounded coverage of Trump. But for the most part, Fox News has lost its way. The Fox News Channel has prided itself on being a network they say is “fair and balanced.” Roger Ailes was a genius for using this term and he explained once it was absolutely true. He said Fox News was network that pushed down on the media scales in order to even things out. The media for too long was controlled by Democrats and liberals. Fox News was there to bring some balance to the landscape. Unfortunately, since last June they have slowly morphed into what everybody said they were: hacks. ",

        "articles": "I’m not going to pretend I have a full understanding of the age group known as Generation Z. The last thing I want to do is give off some “how do you do fellow kids” vibe. I’m not part of that generation and I’m not going to pretend to be in order to try to fit in or get their good graces. What I can gather about their humor, for the most part, is that they’ve abandoned the idea that political correctness has to be a part of any joke being made. Watching some of their videos or listening to their back and forth talk can make one feel like they just walked into a living, breathing episode of South Park. And as shocked and offended as we are, I’m not so sure it’s a bad thing. As much as we rail against political correctness, we’re still soaked in it. My age group, the millennials, especially seem to be a slave to political correctness to the point where even comedy and jokes are completely out of the question unless it results in what Ben Shapiro calls “clapter,” or the act of pretending something is funny when really it’s just a political statement said in a humorous tone. The call to limit free speech polls far higher than it should. We’re so offended all the time. This disposition toward society is the infected sore of years of politically correct programming. We can’t speak truths or even say jokes for fear that it would hurt somebody’s feelings. We’ve become humorless and are willing to allow lies and mistruths to thrive out of fear that correcting them would make you a social pariah. Then enter Gen Z. It’s a light intro, but from being a fan of Tik Tok to watching various Gen Z aged people give their opinions on various topics on YouTube, I’m consistently surprised at what I find. Their social commentary is crude and offensive, but very often spot on. They comfortably throw terms like “faggot” around and make jokes about Hitler. All while not remotely hating gay people and not remotely being fans of Nazism. The darker the humor, the funnier it is. For Gen Z, what would be shocking for everyone else is fun for them. In fact, it’s not the joke that seems to be the most fun part, it’s the reaction it gets from the easily offended. But the most impressive aspect of it all is that because of their non-attentiveness to the politically correct, it has allowed them to see the proverbial man behind the curtain. Their social commentary is often laced with hard truths. They don’t dance around feelings, they cut right to the issue. Many of my generation and older see this and immediately reach for the alarm. The ideas they espouse are considered “dangerous.” Take for instance BuzzFeed’s attack against 14-year-old YouTuber Soph. After watching a few more of her videos, I’m noticing that while her language and takes on things are biting, I didn’t disagree with a lot of what she was saying, and I can’t consider her to be the villain she’s painted as. Sure, there are things she said that are ridiculous and I expect that from a young teenager going through what I call the “prime dumbass years.” But a villain? No. In my opinion, she is to 2019 what Matt Stone and Trey Parker were to the 90’s. In fact, I found myself enjoying a lot of it because for the first time I felt like I wasn’t listening to carefully crafted and cautious commentary, I was listening to unapologetic realism laced with humor I was told by society was out of bounds and evil. It was like a mental itch being scratched. But even among the right and those who are supporters of freedom of speech, I found many who were disgusted by this Gen Z approach. Fair enough. I don’t expect that many would throw Soph, or people like her a parade. Not everything she and the Gen Z crowd are saying would be considered wise by any account. That said, I have to wonder if this isn’t good for us as a society. I look around and see absolute fear when it comes to social expression. Humor has become a liability. Say the wrong thing and the mob will come for you. Make the wrong joke and you may be ruined for life. You may lose your job, or be deplatformed. Mark Meechan of the UK (aka Count Dankula) used his dog to make a Nazi joke and found himself facing a prison sentence. People like Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, and Lauren Southern have been banned from various social media platforms for expressing the wrong opinion or engaging in unapproved activism. I could list a ton more, but this is just one finger swipe of the icing that makes up the entire cake. Trying to list a sufficient amount would take an entire book. Gen Z seems to stand defiant of the consequences and collectively throws a middle finger to the threat the mob presents. It’s a very “you can’t get us all” attitude. It makes the PC police seem very small by comparison, and groups like Antifa easier to laugh at, which is a blessing, seeing as how my generation has been trained to react with outrage toward this kind of thing. I have to appreciate it. I appreciate it because, at this time, the scale is currently tipped toward a hard left, social justice lunacy that is tearing society apart both figuratively and literally. Gen Z is, perhaps unintentionally, applying the correct amount of pressure to tip the scale back ever so slowly. It’s injecting the idea into society that being offensive is okay, and even warranted at times. It’s weaponized desensitization, and we desperately need it in a time when we’re so sensitive about everything. I don’t expect everyone to agree with me. I suspect even members of Gen Z would read this and laugh off the idea that they’re doing anything political at all, that they’re just having fun, and fair enough. However, from my millennial perspective, I have to admire the effect it’s having at this time. Senior Editor. Culture critic, and video creator. Good at bad photoshops. ",

        "articles": "Tucker Carlson, host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" poses for photos in a Fox News Channel studio, in New York, Thursday, March 2, 2107. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Tucker Carlson, host of “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” poses for photos in a Fox News Channel studio, in New York, Thursday, March 2, 2107. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Over the weekend, Tucker Carlson appeared at a rehearsal for Purgatory called the Politicon conference. Before an audience, he took on the story of the death of Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi, just to recap, was a Washington Post op-ed writer who apparently was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The details are sketchy because the details are being spooled out by the Turkish government and media outlets who are in Erdogan’s pocket. So far there have been more retracted stories than those that have been verified. For instance, at first, we were told Khashoggi was cut up and shipped to Saudi Arabia via diplomatic pouch. Today the Turks are claiming they found a body. To date, the alleged video and audio tapes of the incident have not been made available to any neutral third party for technical analysis. While the Washington Post is trying to portray him as some sort of a liberal-minded reformer, Khashoggi was a fan of bin Laden until after 9/11. He was a vociferous supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood (this is a tell that his devotion to a free press and liberal politics was simply a fraudulent front). He was a virulent anti-Semite who denied that the Temple had ever existed in Jerusalem. In short, he was pretty much a dream addition to the Washington Post’s stable of op-ed writers. Anyway, this is how Carlson characterized the story: “The whole game is people who have no basis for moral superiority sort of impose their moral superiority on you,” Carlson said of the widespread media backlash to Saudi Arabia. “The outrage is so false.” He said that “Jamal Khashoggi” is a name nobody knew two weeks ago. “They use that to bully you into submission,” he said of the unified outrage. “It’s a game. Don’t play along.” “Just stop lecturing me,” Carlson said, before miming, “You don’t care enough about Khashoggi!” Carlson, who appeared at the Politicon conference along with Democratic strategist James Carville, conveyed no surprise at Khashoggi’s grim fate, reportedly at the hands of individuals close to the ruling Crown Prince. “The Saudis, and I don’t mean this as a compliment, are acting entirely in character with their character,” he said. “That’s what they do.” Carlson called the Saudi kingdom “a primitive evil theocracy in the desert,” and said he’s not “pro-Saudi.” This drew wounded howls from some, particularly Washington Post’s Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler (this is the guy who rated a Romney statement “true but false”): In annals of stupid comments, this ranks pretty high. Before his murder, there were about 100 references in The Washington Post and 50 in the New York Times, plus numerous interviews with him on CNN, BBC, NPR, etc. He was even interviewed on Fox (Bret Baier) after OBL was killed  — Glenn Kessler (@GlennKesslerWP) October 22, 2018 Tom Bevan of RCP, rightly notes: C'mon. Per the last NBC/WSJ poll, one in four people don't know who MITCH MCCONNELL is. Of course no one knew who Khashoggi was. And to think they would bc of 100 mentions in the Washington Post is the height of arrogant insiderism.  — Tom Bevan (@TomBevanRCP) October 22, 2018 Let me say that I really don’t care what happened to Khashoggi. The guy was a terrorist sympathizer. I really don’t care what Saudi Arabia does to its own citizens so long as they don’t do it on American soil. There is no doubt that Saudi Arabia under Mohammed bin Salman is just as capable of brutality and self-defeating stupidity as it has ever been. But this is not to say that the way the Post and other outlets are using the story is particularly honest. Because it isn’t. This outrage is fake and it is driven by the same people who used that paper to campaign for the Iran nuclear deal. In 2014, the Post’s Iran bureau chief, Jason Rezaian, was arrested by the Iranians and eventually spent two years in prison. The Post has already written more stories on Khashoggi than it did during the entire time Rezaian was imprisoned. The Saudis blundered their way into this mess, but let’s not think for a second that the Post’s outrage and the outrage of other national media has anything to do with them caring about him. This is about blocking Trump’s developing Middle East policy to the benefit of Turkey and Iran. ========= ========= Like what you see? Then visit my story archive. Follow @streiff I’m on Facebook.
