        "articles": "Felons in California will now have the right to vote behind bars thanks to AB 2466, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law on Wednesday. As part of a progressive effort to hasten their transition back into society, thousands of felons in county jail will now be able to take part in California elections. Under the new law, anyone convicted of a felony, but who is not currently in state or federal prison or on parole, is allowed to vote. California’s constitution denies the right to vote to anyone in prison or on parole. In 2011, the state’s Realignment Plan shifted many of the state’s corrections program responsibilities to local government. It spurred the transfer of many low-level felony offenders to county-run jails and programs in an effort to reduce overcrowded state and federal prisons and save money. AB 2466 was borne from a 2014 lawsuit on behalf of those low-level felons who were no longer in state or federal prison. The lawsuit argued the people in county programs shouldn’t be classified the same as other felons, and won. Upon introducing the bill, Democratic Assemblywoman Shirley Brown argued that civic participation would reduce the recidivism rate. \"I wrote AB 2466 because I want to send a message to the nation that California will not stand for discrimination in voting,” she said Wednesday. Daniel Zingale, senior vice president of The California Endowment, a private health foundation, agreed. “California is stronger and healthier when more people participate in the electoral process,” he said, reports the Los Angeles Times. “Mass disenfranchisement for minor offenses is a tragic legacy of the Jim Crow era that disproportionately affects and diminishes the power of communities of color.” But there’s plenty of disagreement—and not just from Republican lawmakers. The California State Sheriffs’ Assn and the California Police Chiefs Assn. opposed the legislation. “We believe that there have to be consequences to your action, and the consequences of being a convicted felon are that you can’t vote and you can’t possess firearms,” Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood, president of the California State Sheriffs’ Assn., told the LA Times. The new law could mean as many as 50,000 new voters in California. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Democrats spent weeks beating up the GOP tax bill. It’s Armageddon. It’s a giveaway to the wealthy. The polling reflected it. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and ex-Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) were so sure that companies would never share the money saved through tax breaks that they made this video below, which did not age well: Still, when it comes to tax policy, the GOP is pretty much united. With just Republican votes, the legislation, the most extensive tax reform in 30 years, passed. Companies then started giving workers bonuses, with calls to increase philanthropic giving and boost U.S. investment. In all, the Democratic Party was left eating crow as over 100 companies have now given their workers bonuses of at least $1,000 or more. Now, Warren is backtracking. “Look, I am glad when I read that there are companies that have given out $1,000 in bonuses. There are companies that say they’re going to re-work some of their benefit plans…I’m in favor of all of that. I want to see working families do better—you bet,” she said recently. So, then why did you vote against the bill? Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was the first to admit that this bill gives middle and working class families a tax cut. It’s a good thing, he admitted to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Christmas Eve, but it didn’t go far enough. Talk about a shameful moving of the goal posts. Democrats thought the bill wouldn’t pass. It did. They thought it wouldn’t trigger companies to reinvest in their workers. A slate of companies have done just that. This bill will also become more popular. I’m willing to bet a lot on that—and the Left will have to explain why they voted against the American worker, the American middle class, and economic growth when that happens. The Democratic Party was gambling with the financial future and health of American families in order to try ad screw over President Trump because they don’t like him. The GOP has a unique opportunity to deliver a deathblow to the Democrats before the midterms. They need to since the Democrats have the wind to their backs. A smart messaging campaign that tears down their false talking points is a good start. The economy is booming. We’re at four percent economic growth. Consumer confidence is at a 17-year high. The Dow Jones blew past 25,000 once it was revealed that 250,000 private sector jobs were created last December. Apparently, this is all bad news if you’re a member of the Democratic Party. The agenda of getting poorer together is getting upset by the Trump White House. Left-leaning tax policy center finds that 80.4% of Americans would see a tax cut in 2018. The average decrease would be $2,140. Only 4.8% would see a tax  pic.twitter.com/52F9uDx90Z .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Recall the timeline here: First, sick of Washington and on the outs with President Trump, Bob Corker announced his intention to retire from the Senate at the end of this term. Shortly thereafter, conservative Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn jumped into the race to fill that vacant seat, instantly rocketing into 'favorite' status. Then, amid rumors about worrisome internal polling after Democrats landed a prized recruit to try to flip the seat, Corker started floating trial balloons about reversing his decision and re-entering the contest. In response, Blackburn took a clear shot across Corker's bow, emphasizing that she's all-in, with a zero percent chance of backing away just because he's second guessing himself. As Leah reported yesterday, her comments to Hugh Hewitt were crystal clear: “I am running, and I’m going to win,” the congresswoman told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Friday. “I think what Tennesseans want to see, Hugh, is a true conservative in the U.S. Senate...“I am very drawn to doing what I can do to help preserve faith, family, freedom, hope and opportunity,” she explained. “And my husband and I decided that this is the race that would be the right race, the right fit. It was the right time for our family, so we’re in the race.” Responding to whether she believes she could defeat Corker should he decide to jump back in the race, Blackburn was confident: “I certainly do.” It doesn't sound like she's going anywhere. And just to underscore that point, a PAC supporting her candidacy just dropped a poll showing Blackburn with a commanding lead over Corker in a hypothetical Republican primary -- and that's not all: Poll from pro-Blackburn PAC: She leads Corker by a 2-to-1 margin in hypothetical GOP matchup & holds a five-point edge over the Dem candidate, a popular former governor:  In a potential head-to-head matchup among Republican primary voters, the poll found 55 percent of respondents favored Blackburn, while Corker garnered just 26 percent...In a head-to-head matchup between Blackburn and Bredesen, 44 percent of likely voters said they favored the Brentwood Republican, while Bredesen netted 39 percent...In a matchup between Bredesen and Corker, likely voters supported the Democrat. Forty-four percent of voters said they favored Bredesen, compared with 35 percent for Corker. As I noted in the tweet, these numbers should be considered with a grain of salt, given the source (Ed Morrissey points out that we don't even have access to internals or methodology); it would be nice to get some independent confirmation from a nonpartisan pollster. But if the results are even remotely accurate, Corker would face a steep uphill battle just to regain his own party's nomination, and might fare worse against the Democrats' than Blackburn would. By the way, it's interesting to see Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sounding pretty bearish about the party's chances this coming fall. Here's the part of his statement that really grabbed my attention: The top Republican in the Senate told The New York Times for a story published Saturday that \"the odds are\" his party will face losses in both chambers of Congress this year. “The odds are that we will lose seats in the House and the Senate,” McConnell said. “History tells you that, the fired-up nature of the political left tells you that. We go into this cleareyed that this is going to be quite a challenging election,\" he added. McConnell also acknowledged a fundraising deficit faced by some GOP Senate candidates in key states, a figure he attributed to those challenging incumbent Democratic senators. “I concede the fund-raising problem,” McConnell said. This sounds like expectations management, coupled with a wake-up call for Republican donors -- but McConnell predicting losses in the House and Senate is eye-opening nonetheless. GOP losses in the lower house are nearly inevitable, but the upper chamber map is so unbelievably favorable to the majority party this cycle that projecting a net loss of seats suggests the McConnell is worried not just about the \"usual\" concerns (Arizona and Nevada) but others, too. Perhaps including Tennessee. And with a 51-49 majority, McConnell has almost no breathing room at all, following the Alabama debacle. Republicans should theoretically be talking about a net gain in the Senate this year, even in an unfavorable environment. Democratic incumbents appear highly vulnerable in a number of red states, and the national climate may not be as ugly as once feared. Know this: If Republicans are actually in any danger of losing the Tennessee seat, November will be a bloodbath. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Right after the 9th Circuit Court ruled against President Trump’s executive order on immigration and refugees, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said, “We are a nation of laws, and as we have said those laws apply to everybody in our country.\" When he was uttering these words, he seemed to ignore the fact that right in his home state, Washington, its largest city, Seattle, is one of those \"sanctuary cities\" which refuses to enforce federal immigration laws. The mayor of Seattle, Ed Murray, is one of the staunchest defenders of Seattle's \"sanctuary city\" policy, even after police charged five illegal immigrants who shot and killed Jill Marie Sundberg at a location about 150 miles east of Seattle in last December. It seems the Left only chooses to embrace the \"rule of law\" if the result is in their favor. How did we as a nation end up with so many sanctuary cities? The sanctuary movement started in the 1980s when about a million Central Americans, mainly from El Salvador and Guatemala, crossed the U.S. border-seeking asylum from their repressive governments and seemingly never-ending civil wars. But the Reagan administration was supporting these governments’ (especially the governments of El Salvador and Guatemala) attempts to fight communist rebels. Therefore, the administration would only characterize Salvadorans and Guatemalans as “economic migrants, not eligible for policy asylum.” Hundreds of churches in the U.S. openly defied the U.S. government and its immigration policy by providing safe havens for Central Americans. The movement later was turned into an indictment of the Reagan administration’s Central America policy. Eventually, in 1990, Congress passed legislation allowing the president to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to certain groups in need of a temporary safe haven, including explicitly designating Salvadorans for TPS. Influenced by the sanctuary movement, San Francisco passed the “City and County of Refuge” Ordinance in 1989, which barred city money from being used to enforce immigration law. Hundreds of U.S. cities and counties have followed suit and adopted similar “sanctuary” laws or policies. While San Francisco barred city money from being used to enforce immigration law, it didn’t hesitate to use city money (really, taxpayers’ money) to shield “convicted juvenile offenders who were in the country illegally from federal authorities, either escorting them to their home countries at city expense or transporting them to group homes, often outside the city.” It's worth pointing out that San Francisco receives over $1 billion dollars from the federal government on an annual basis. As an immigrant, I find the idea of establishing a sanctuary city that operates outside of certain laws of the land very troubling. Supporters of \"Sanctuary cities\" believe they are being compassionate toward immigrants. But what these supporters are doing is to cater to a small segment of the immigrant population at the expense of most law-abiding legal immigrants. We as a nation have three times more legal immigrants than illegal immigrants. Many legal immigrants, including myself, followed the law, endured long waits and long separation from our families and made many other sacrifices to become an American. Yes, our immigration law is broken. A real relief for all immigrants would be a common sense based immigration reform. Yet, \"sanctuary cities\" are taking resources and people's attention away from focusing on sensible immigration reform. Furthermore, many of us immigrants chose to leave everything and everyone we are familiar with behind to come to the U.S. because we are tired of chaos and lawlessness back in our homelands. We want to live and raise our families in a place where law and order prevail. But the idea of \"sanctuary cities\" sends the wrong message. When lawless behavior goes unpunished, it only encourages more lawlessness. On May 12, 2014, 32-year-old Mesa police officer Brandon Mendoza was killed in a head-on collision with a wrong-way driver. The driver was Raul Silva Corona, an illegal alien from Chihuahua, Mexico, who in 1994 pleaded guilty to criminal conspiracy in Adams County Colorado but was not deported. Colorado is one of the handful sanctuary states and in 2013; Colorado passed a bill to allow illegal immigrants living in Colorado to get driver's licenses. Sgt. Mendoza's mom wrote a passionate letter to President Obama. She stated, \"My son, Brandon Mendoza, was half Hispanic. It's not the color of skin that my son or I see, it's the person and how they conduct their lives.\" On July 1, 2015, Francisco Sanchez, a 45-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico, shot Kate Steinle as she walked on San Francisco’s Pier 14 with her father and a friend. Sanchez claimed the shooting was an accident. Whether the shooting was an accident or not, this tragedy could have been prevented had the San Francisco Sherriff's Department not released Sanchez from their custody a few months before. The Sherriff's department claimed that they merely followed San Francisco's \"Sanctuary City\" guideline, even though they were fully aware that Sanchez not only broke immigration law multiple times (he illegally crossed the border five times), he was also on probation in Texas at the time of shooting. While it's important to remember that neither Raul Silva Corona nor Francisco Sanchez represent all 40 million immigrants and a few anecdotes don't epitomize a trend or evidence, more and more people feel that Sanctuary cities or communities do not promote freedom and compassion; they promote chaos. Furthermore, they help fuel distrust and resentment between immigrants and native-born Americans. \"Sanctuary cities\" have done a disservice to all American people, and governments at both local and federal levels are losing credibility in their ability to protect lawful residents. Let's not forget that the entire United States is a sanctuary for people who seek a better life by working hard and abiding by the law of the land. We as a nation can only continue to play the role of a sanctuary for all who seek freedom and escape from oppression if we continue to uphold the rule of law. The left needs to stop its hypocrisy of proclaiming, \"we are a nation of laws\" on the one hand and choosing to follow laws selectively on the other hand. If you're truly compassionate toward immigrants' well being, please stop supporting sanctuary cities. Instead, please advocate for a common-sense immigration reform. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "I guess now we’re not supposed to be fighting culture wars anymore – man, it’s so hard to keep up with these ever-changing new rules! I’m old enough to remember way back to 2016, before Trump got nominated, and I could have sworn Conservative Inc., was gung-ho for the whole culture war thing. But then Trump actually fought it, taking on the big, soft target that is the spoiled, semi-literate athletes who like to rub their contempt for the flag we love in our faces in the guise of woke wokedness. Now we suddenly discover that fighting back is horribly uncouth and déclassé and “Oh, well I never!” Gosh, I would have thought from all those cruise panels about how our crumbling culture is slouching toward Babylon and the need to resist the liberal onslaught that maybe we ought to actually resist the liberal onslaught, but see, that was my mistake. I took it seriously when Conservative, Inc., promised to fight the leftist blitzkrieg against normal Americans. It was all a scam, a lie, a pose for us rubes. The Tru Cons didn’t actually mean it. There’s a lot of that not meaning it going on in the GOP right now. Exhibit A is John McCain, who ran ads touting how he was leading the way in opposing Obamacare only to give it aid and comfort when someone in the White House would actual sign its repeal. He’s the guy the establishment designated to lose to Barack Obama in 2008, and he was sure up to the task. But in retrospect, thank goodness, because McCain’s inevitable presidential betrayal of conservatives by breaking his word then and treating GOP voters like he treated his first wife would have done exponentially more damage to conservatism than Trump being prevented from keeping his word today ever could. It’s so good to know that, despite his wonderful, close, awesome friend humiliating him while lying to Arizona’s voters, Lindsey Graham is still the blue falcon’s buddy. No hard feelings! There used to be a thing called “conservatism,” and I knew it pretty well since I was part of it for about a third of a century. But conservatism changed, becoming less about principles (though the wusscons never shut up about them) and more about money-grubbing navel gazing and intellectual onanism. Actual Republican voters, actual normal Americans? Well, they became kind of beside the point in the tumbler-klinking world of the John Boehnercons, and to the corporate-friendly compassioncons who put the interests of everyone else (including the act of lovers) ahead of the GOP voters who voted the establishment in. Conservativism forgot about the real world conservatives we expected to line up behind us. While we were talking about free trade, we were ignoring that GOP voter who fought in Fallujah, came home, got a job building air conditioners, raised a family, and then one day watched the video of the oh-so-sorry CEO – who looked remarkably like Mitt Romney, because all these guys look remarkably like Mitt Romney – sadly informing his beloved employees that their jobs were getting shipped to Oaxaca. And our response to the 58-year old Republican voter who asked us how he was going to keep paying for his mortgage and his kid in college? Pretty much, “Well, that’s how free enterprise works. Read some Milton Freidman and go learn coding.” That’s not a response, not for a political party that requires people to actually vote for it. That’s an abdication, but what did Conservative, Inc., care? Priorities! “There’s this new tapas place in Georgetown everyone is talking about – the other night, my buddy from the Liberty Freedom Eagle Institute for Liberty, Freedom and Eagles saw Lawrence O’Donnell there getting hammered!” How about the guy who wanted to be a roofer in Fontana but he couldn’t because the contractors were only hiring illegals? What was our answer to him? “Oh well, the big corporate donors need their serfs, and if some pack of tatted-up MS-13 dreamers gang-rapes your daughter that’s just a price we’re willing to pay!” They try to crush our religion and Conservative, Inc., cowers because Apple’s CEO might say mean things. “Just bake the cake,” they say – it’s not worth the fight! They demand our tax money to kill babies and Conservative, Inc., passes the spending bills – “Gosh, we can’t risk the WaPo saying we’re mean!” They diss our National Anthem, we react, and Conservative, Inc., wags its soft, spindly fingers – “So, so very unpresidential! My word!” Conservatism has become a racket, and everything happening now is a result of its members hoping to wait out Trump and the demand for change he represents. Maybe if they do nothing, but say all the right things, we normals will get tired and go back to our jobs and keep providing those votes and renting those cruise cabins. But that’s not happening. We aren’t going away; business as usual is over. We aren’t just giving up, tossing away our country, and submitting to the ruling caste. We were nice with the Tea Party. Trump’s not as nice. What’s coming after is going to be much, much less nice. What’s coming after is militant normalacy, the not-so-polite demand that the lackwits and failures who style themselves as our betters stop dumping on us normal Americans who work hard and play by the rules (Gosh that sounds familiar, like it used to be a winning electoral recipe, if only I could remember where I heard it before). Who are the normals? The Americans who built this country, and defended it. When you eat, it’s because a normal grew the food and another normal trucked it to you. When you aren’t murdered in the street or don’t speak German, it’s because a normal with a gun made those things not happen. We normals don’t want to rule over others. We don’t obsess about how you live your life, but also we don’t want to be compelled to signal our approval or pick up the tab. We are every color and creed – though when someone who is incidentally a member of some other group aligns with normals, he/she/xe loses that identity. The left drums normals who are black out of its definition of “black,” just as normal women get drummed out of womanhood and normal gays get drummed out gayhood. In a way, the left is making E pluribus unum a reality again – to choose to be normal is to choose to reject silly identity group identification and unite. Instead of saying “normal Americans,” you can just say “Americans.” Note that while leftists rail against the term “normals” (When I use it on Twitter, the reactions are always delightful!), they will never, ever demand to be counted as one. That’s because they hate normal Americans, wanting us enslaved or dead. How do I know? They tell me on Twitter, again and again and again. Militant normality is growing as normals awaken to the indisputable truth of our enemy’s implacable hatred for us and everything we hold dear – like America. The sight of moron sportsball players disrespecting normals warms libs’ frigid little hearts – and make no mistake, that diss is aimed straight at us, not at some musical number. All these cultural aggressions are aimed at us, from demanding you obey their pronoun proclamations to requiring your daughter share a toilet with a dude in a skirt. This is how they seek to break us. That’s why the shameful abdication of Conservative, Inc., in the cultural fight is both important and irrelevant. It demonstrates that the first loyalty of many folks in the conservaracket is to the ruling caste to which they belong, and it also demonstrates that these wimps’ absence from the battle means nothing. We’ll fight this fight ourselves, thanks. Sometimes we’ll fight it by rediscovering the joy of a late evening without hack TV comics lecturing us about health care (Hey, Jimmy Kimmel had a sick son, and that unusual and unique experience means he has unusual and unique insights!). Sometimes we’ll hit the remote and spend our Sunday not watching future vegetables hating on our country when they aren’t smashing into each other. Sometimes we’ll mock these idiots mercilessly. We may even launch a Conservative Insurgency. And if they keep pushing, getting violent and trying to strip us of our sacred rights, we might get even more frisky, and then it’ll get ugly. But we’re not giving up, and we’re not going to sit back and just take it. Militant normalcy is the result of normal people roused to anger and refusing to be pushed around anymore. We prefer a free society based on personal liberty and mutual respect. But if you leftists veto that option, that leaves us either a society where you rule and oppress us, or one where we hold the power. So let me break this down, both for the left and for their fussy Fredocon enablers: You don’t get to win.

        "articles": "If the mainstream media were a college class, Republicans would be taking advanced calculus taught by a short tempered professor from South Korea with bad English, while Democrats would be taking remedial reading pass/fail. In other words, as long as liberals don't do anything to embarrass the Democrat Party, they get treated with kid gloves while all Republicans should assume reporters would just as soon punch them in the throat as ask them a question. What this means is that Obama seldom has to deal with tough questions a Republican in his shoes would have to hear asked on an almost daily basis. That was the case in 2008, it was the case in 2012 and it's still the case today. Whether you're talking about press conferences, cable news shows, or the editorial pages, Barack Obama should be hit with questions like these on a regular basis until he comes up with some real answers instead of stonewalling or ignoring them until they're heard no more. 1) Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan \"described himself as mujahedeen\" and yelled “Allahu Akbar” as he murdered 13 of his fellow soldiers. As Commander-In-Chief, do you agree with the Department of Defense report that labeled that killing as \"workplace violence\" or was that an act of terrorism? 2) Do you regret aggravating racial tensions in America by inserting yourself into the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin case by saying, \"If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon?\" 3) Americans died in Benghazi and it’s a \"phony scandal\" -- Would you tell a mother who lost a son there that it was a \"phony scandal?\" 4) If it's legal for you to unilaterally delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act's Employer Mandate without Congress having a say, couldn't a Republican President legally choose to unilaterally delay or stop the entire bill? 5) How can the American people trust the federal government to have their private data on file when we already know unreliable people like Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning are being given access to that data? Beyond that, given that your administration has refused to come clean about what you're doing and has been caught lying on more than a few different issues, how can the American people just take your word for it when you say that private information about American citizens you have no right to view isn't being looked at anyway? 6) If Republicans send you a bill without funding for Obamacare in it, are you willing to shut down the government to fund the program? 7) Your administration is flat out refusing to enforce existing immigration law. Since that's the case, shouldn't the American people assume that if a comprehensive immigration bill were to pass that grants legal status to undocumented Americans in return for tough new laws, that the new laws wouldn't be enforced either? 8) Given that the IRS has illegally targeted Tea Party groups, isn't it reasonable for Republican groups to demand that the IRS not be allowed to participate in Obamacare? 9) Unarguably, the economy has performed extremely poorly since you became President. Do you think you've made any mistakes that helped cause the problem? If so, what are they? 10) Do you consider your administration's strategy in Egypt, Syria, and Libya to be a success? If not, what did you do wrong that caused you to fail? 11) Early on in your administration, Hillary Clinton rather famously presented a button to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that was supposed to say \"reset,\" but actually said \"overcharge.\" Since the Russians are refusing to hand over Edward Snowden, is it fair to say that the \"reset\" failed and that relations have actually deteriorated since you took over from George Bush? 12) Are you now willing to admit that a lot of the promises made to the American people to sell the Affordable Care Act just weren't true? Prices are going up for most people, not down. Congress is getting the cost of its care supplemented. Not everybody is going to get to keep his doctor. It goes on and on. Do you feel any attacks of conscience over all the lies that were told? Does it keep you up at night? 13) In 2008, you promised to change how things worked in Washington and bring unity to the country. Obviously you've failed and things have gotten very hostile between you and the Republicans in Congress. Do you believe you've done anything to contribute to the polarization in the country and the acrimonious relationship you have with Republicans or do you believe you haven't made any mistakes? 14) After seeing the behavior of Anthony Weiner, Eliot Spitzer, and Bob Filner, are Americans justified in asking if your party is engaged in a war on women? 15) Many people have compared your administration to the Nixon Administration because of the stonewalling of Congress, using executive privilege to keep the truth from Congress, and because the IRS has been used against your political enemies. Do you think that it's fair to compare your behavior to Richard Nixon's behavior before he was almost impeached and if not, why not? 16) If Al-Qaeda has been decimated and it’s on the run, why have we had to recently close down 22 embassies and consulates because of the threat from Al-Qaeda? 17) The IRS is still flagging and holding Tea Party applications. So not only was the IRS's behavior a problem, it still is a problem today. Why did your administration allow this to happen, why haven't you taken action to fix the problems at the IRS, and what are you going to do to ensure that the IRS doesn't continue to target your political opponents on your watch? 18) How do you justify going on extravagant vacations and sending hundreds of millions to the Egyptians and Palestinians when you're cancelling Easter Egg rolls at the White House and pleading poverty because of the sequester?. Aren't you deliberately sabotaging parts of government that are popular with the country to give the false impression that the sequester is having a serious impact on government spending? 19) To this day, we still don't know what you were doing during the Benghazi attack, what directives you issued, why your administration lied about what was going on, whether you had good reason to have such lax security in the first place, and whether Americans troops could have potentially arrived in time to save the lives of the men who died. When is your administration going to come clean so that the families of the men who lost their lives can have some peace? 20) In 2012, you said, \"We refused to throw in the towel and do nothing. We refused to let Detroit go bankrupt. We bet on American workers and American ingenuity, and three years later, that bet is paying off in a big way.\" Since Detroit has now gone bankrupt, do you think that bet is still paying off or did the American people waste billions of dollars for nothing? Do you think you deserve any blame for Detroit going bankrupt? How about unions?

        "articles": "The Democratic Governor of Oregon, a former abortion lobbyist, is preparing to enthusiastically sign a bill into law (\"yes! yes! yes!\" she ghoulishly tweeted) that would enshrine the most radically pro-abortion regime of any state in the US. Most people who consider themselves pro-choice on abortion are not radically pro-abortion, but some of the deep-pocketed special interests that bankroll the Democratic Party have earned that loaded moniker. Here are some details on the new law, via LifeSiteNews: The Oregon state legislature has passed a tax bill to make abortion free for all. Tax-funded abortions for both residents and non-residents throughout the state is the goal of House Bill 3391-B, which now goes to Democratic Gov. Kate Brown’s desk...The law would force health insurers to cover abortions without any co-pay and give more than $10 million for abortions and other “reproductive services” to Medicaid. Pro-lifers predict that most of the $10 million will go to Planned Parenthood. Oregon has the most permissive abortion laws in the nation, with no informed consent for women, no waiting for the major surgery of abortion, no parental consent or even parental notification for minors, no ambulance-ready requirements, and no basic safeguards required for all other surgical centers. And ABC News: Insurance companies in Oregon would be required to cover abortions and other reproductive services at no cost to the patient regardless of income, citizenship status or gender identity under a measure approved Wednesday by lawmakers. Oregon already has some of the most liberal abortion laws in the U.S., leaving out otherwise common requirements for waiting periods or spending limits on taxpayer funds...In some states such as New York, abortions are cost-free if they're deemed medically necessary. The Oregon bill is unique, however, in that patients would have access to the procedure for virtually any reason, at any time, including sex-selective and late-term abortions. If you are an illegal immigrant whose fetus is in her third trimester of development, and you decide that you'd prefer a boy instead, your totally elective, sex-selective, late-term abortion is not only legal under this law -- taxpayers will pay for it, or your insurance plan must cover it with no copay. It's difficult to imagine anything more extreme, aside from compulsory abortions. It's horrifying. Every single Oregon Senate Democrat voted in favor of this monstrosity, with every Republican opposed. The House vote was also almost exclusively along party lines. Governor Brown giddily vowed to sign the legislation, calling opposition to tax-funded late-term abortion \"an attack on all Oregonians.\" Orwellian. In addition to highlighting this episode as a breathtaking affront to human rights, I've highlighted this political development for two other reasons. First, to underscore the abject radicalism of the Democratic Party's abortion stance. Oregon's government is dominated by Democrats, so they were able to implement a bill that broadly reflects the party's platform, and delights the party's abortion zealot bankrollers. Democrats frequently assail Republicans as \"extremists\" on this issue, yet it's their party that's truly extreme, opposing virtually all restrictions on legalized abortion-on-demand. They are wildly out of step with the American people on these questions. One of the reasons they get away with it is the media, which brings me to my second point. Journalists tend to favor Democrats, which is no surprise, but their bias is especially pronounced on social issues such as abortion, an entrenched problem that dates back decades. We're often told by media apologists that the press is merely biased in favor of conflict, which helps explain why big state-level controversies on hot-button issues tend to make national news. Think of Arizona's SB 1070 on immigration, or Indiana's (grossly mischaracterized) religious freedom bill, or the ruckus over Texas' abortion law that outlawed most abortions after the fifth month of gestation. These were big national stories. Correspondents from New York and Washington descended on these state capitols, often framing Republicans as the bad guys pushing \"divisive\" laws. Left-wing State Senator Wendy Davis was a media darling as she fought against the Texas bill, with protesters storming the rotunda and interrupting votes. It was about \"women's rights,\" you see. Never mind that women heavily supported the 20-week ban. Cast your mind back to those three major dust-ups I mentioned, then ask yourself whether you've heard anything about the Oregon legislation that even approaches that level of breathless, flood-the-zone coverage. This bill theoretically checks all the \"conflict\" boxes (except, perhaps, large organized protests disrupting legislative sessions), but passed with little notice. It seems as though certain controversial, or even radical, pieces of legislation dealing with red hot 'culture war' issues aren't terribly interesting to many in the press for some reason.

        "articles": "Looking over the frenzied political landscape in America today, one marred by constant clashes between right and left, a single issue rises above the rest. In many areas of public life, conservatives – their words, their views and values – are under assault. Conservative speech is under direct attack by ultra-left, radical activists who are methodically expunging conservative speech and conservative ideas from public discourse. This threat to the First Amendment and to the sharing of viewpoints held by roughly half of all Americans, is taking many forms but is often paired with harsh threats and actual acts of violence directed at conservatives. Brutal physical assaults on conservative men and women are waged by an increasingly radical subsection of our society that is growing in power and bravado. Andy Ngo, a reporter for Quillette, was viciously attacked by masked Antifa thugs while exercising his First Amendment right to free press. The video of his attack was seen by millions, and his subsequent article in the Wall Street Journal prompted a response from Capitol Hill. However, while most on the conservative side condemned the attack on a member of the press, most progressives – those who supposedly carry the torch of free speech – were conspicuously silent on the issue. Meeting speech with violence is completely unacceptable and directly opposite of the American model of the free exchange of ideas in pluralistic society. But leftist activists often get away with labeling anything they disagree with as, “hate speech” and they work hard to silence the messenger. The violence committed against Mr. Ngo placed him in the hospital, and was justified by street thugs simply because Ngo is a “conservative,” who “unmasked Antifa.” Fortunately, some organizations are working to stem this violent, hateful tide. A new legal defense group, Publius Lex, founded by Harmeet Dhillon works to preserve justice in a system that seems all too hesitant to investigate and prosecute violent Antifa activists. They have taken Mr. Ngo on as their first legal case. A more systematic problem of bias against conservative free speech exists on many college campuses around the country. Thoroughly reported by Campus Reform and The College Fix, progressive students enabled by agenda-driven professors and college administrators regularly harass conservative students. Some incidents of suppression manifest in the destruction of property. More subtle cases have been documented such as professors marking down the grades of conservative students for no reason other than a student’s traditional values. Many universities are also limiting conservative speech via unaccountable administrative tribunals (bias response teams) that make conservative students appear before panels of school officials to answer for comments made in a classroom or elsewhere on campus. Complaints lodged against conservative students are usually anonymous and these accused students often have no legal representation or due process. In addition, many college campuses foster environments where conservative students are shouted down and discriminated against for their views or values. Many students are now afraid to share their ideas of views that challenge prevailing liberal doctrine. A new organization is meeting, head on, these threats to the First Amendment on college campuses: Speech Firstis dedicated to protecting students’ speech rights on campus through advocacy, litigation, and other means. Speech First has filed federal lawsuits against the University of Michigan, University of Texas-Austin, and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign seeking to restore freedom of speech on campuses and ensure that college students attend classes and participate in activities that promote open discourse. Many social media platforms are blatantly discriminating against conservatives with Silicon Valley executives openly expressing their disdain for conservative ideas. The de-platforming and banning of prominent center-right voices and conservative thought leaders has touched off accusations of bias and targeting. Twitter now has a policy saying anyone using an incorrect gender pronoun, or wrong first name of someone else could be banned. Twitter has effectively shut down hotly-contested debates on subjects such as gender identity with these bans almost always going against conservative thought. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, recently rolled out a new ‘feature.’ It will utilize artificial intelligence to read every single comment or post, and if the algorithm deems the content of the post to be offensive in any way, Instagram will ask you to confirm your post. It’s not difficult to imagine how this algorithm could be manipulated to flag and suppress conservative speech. The Media Research Center is now monitoring online bias against conservatives. TechWatch documents conservative bias and fights against online censorship of conservatives on various social media platforms. Their online blogs document the onslaught of offensive Silicon Valley has committed against conservatives, as well as how conservatives feel about Big Tech. Preserving free speech in America and maintaining respect for one another - no matter what political opinions or religious beliefs we may have – is essential to the survival of our nation. What’s more – our First Amendment rights are not labeled Republican or Democrat. Public streets, campus classrooms and online forums should be centers of robust – mutually respected – debate. Sadly, that is no longer the case. Those who are engaging in the fight to preserve conservative values and the unfettered expression of conservative speech, deserve our respect and our full support. # # # Ken Blackwell is a Senior Fellow for Human Rights and Constitutional Governance at the Family Research Council.

What if that language is actually written by faceless bureaucrats and not by accountable members of Congress? What if members of Congress in fact rarely read any legislation before voting on it? What if some legislation refers to secrets and secret procedures that only a few members of Congress are permitted to see and utilize?

What if that committee can authorize secret wars in foreign lands conducted not by the military but by the CIA? What if the reason these folks authorize the CIA and not the military to conduct secret wars is the existence of federal laws that require reporting to and a vote of the entire Congress for the military to be used but require only the small secret committee to approve for the CIA to be used? Because wars cost money and often cost lives, what if the effect of the decisions of the small secret committee is that the committee is basically a Congress within Congress?

What if they know that the voters would react forcefully and decisively if the voters knew what the members of the Congress within Congress know but they still won't tell us? What if all this diversion of power from the elected Congress to the Congress within Congress and all this reliance on secret data has resulted in the most pervasive surveillance by any government of any people at any time in world history?

        "articles": "Yogi Berra said, “It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.” But here goes. Barring a major political earthquake, Ted Cruz will be the GOP nominee later this year. As the primaries get under way, two or three candidates will quickly emerge. Based on the voting blocks which are apparent in the current polling, and their likely moves as the options narrow, the most likely result is a Cruz win, perhaps by a landslide. With a strong anti-establishment sentiment among GOP voters, 65% are going for one of the opposition candidates, either Donald Trump (35%), Ted Cruz (20%), or Ben Carson (10%), according to recent RCP averages. These voters are angry that the Republicans have done so little to resist Obama and advance a conservative agenda. They remember how establishment candidates McCain and Romney fared in 2008 and 2012. They will not be appeased. That leaves only 35% for the GOP establishment candidates to fight over, led by Marco Rubio (now 11%), Chris Christie (5%), and Jeb Bush (3%). Beyond these three, nobody has more than 3%. There is no path to victory for any of them, with the possible exception of Rubio. Some might question whether Rubio should be considered as part of the establishment, but rightly or wrongly, many voters think so. Now back to the opposition candidates. Trump and Carson are acceptable to many opposition voters because they are not tainted by any of the party failures of the past eight years. Cruz qualifies by virtue of having stood up against what he calls the “Washington cartel.” Currently at 35%, Trump has too many negatives to go much higher, but he can go lower. Voters not already in his camp are truly anti-Trump. They love to watch him scorn the media, but his screwball remarks make them nervous about November. Nominating an unelectable Trump would forfeit the best opportunity to elect the first conservative president since Ronald Reagan. Can you say “President Hillary Clinton?” Furthermore, Trump has no history as a conservative and nobody can predict what he might do in office. He is a risk that most GOP voters — currently 65% — are smart enough not to take. Can Trump’s support collapse? Yes. As his supporters take a closer look at his antics on the campaign trail, many will ultimately conclude prudence demands an electable conservative, not a bombastic contrarian. But they won’t go for any of the establishment candidates; clearly, they will go to either Cruz or Carson. Now down to 10%, Carson’s weaknesses (e.g., lack of experience) have been exposed. Ask any business owner, “Would you let the smartest, most good-hearted doctor in town come in and take over your business?” The answer will be “No.” Managing the US Government is a much bigger and more complex job than managing any corporation. It’s no place for a trainee. That leaves Cruz. He can pick up votes from Trump and Carson, but Trump can’t get more than he already has. What about the other 35%, those not yet in one of the opposition camps? Where will they go? Will they stick with their favorite also-ran, or will they switch to a more viable alternative? It depends on how frightened of Trump they are. Establishment voters may not like Cruz, but they fear a Trump nomination. If Trump is still threatening, many will decide, perhaps at the last minute, to vote for Cruz as the most viable alternative. Cruz has another advantage, and that is organization. He has raised more money than any other GOP candidate. According to media reports, his organization is much more developed than is Trump’s. Look for him to outperform the pre-election polling. Look for Trump to underperform. There is one caveat. Rubio could challenge in a three-way race if the opposition voters split evenly between Trump and Cruz, but he would have to run the table in picking up establishment voters, now hopelessly split among 8+ candidates. It’s a longshot at best. It depends on the level of fear. If Rubio gets close, Trump voters could run to Cruz because they perceive Rubio to be soft on immigration. If Trump stays close, Rubio voters could run to Cruz because they know Trump would be unelectable in November. Advantage Cruz. In summary, Trump is maxed out and will decline as his voters are sobered up by thoughts of a November disaster. Cruz can pick up voters from every other camp, as people focus more and more on the candidates and the realistic alternatives. Cruz is more electable in November, has better organization, and will attract both opposition and establishment GOP voters. He has momentum, and his victory in Iowa will provide another boost. Rubio could challenge, but Trump and Cruz would have to split evenly and Rubio would have to capture all of the establishment voters. Nobody else can come close. Cruz wins, possibly in a landslide. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "God’s Not Dead director Harold Cronk said his life hasn't changed all that much since the franchise's success. He still lives in Michigan in his family home and he's still the same guy. He has, however, gained notoriety in Hollywood and as a result he has been able to pursue more film making with a team at 10 West studios. For instance, he recently directed Unbroken 2, the sequel to Angelina Jolie's original Unbroken, the story of World War Two hero Louie Zamperini. Then, God Bless the Broken Road was born. Cronk's newest film tells the story of a young woman, Amber, who finds out that her husband has died fighting in Afghanistan. Cronk said that Amber represents the thousands of military families who make the sacrifices that come with having to worry about a loved one overseas while still keeping their homes intact. \"The sacrifices made by our military heroes and their families and we wanted to highlight that there are many of those families that are struggling right now with loss and grave injury and they need our support,\" Cronk said. Cronk is proud to be partnering with the Great American Veterans, the oldest military charity in the country and hoping to raise both money and awareness. He is donating 5 percent of net profits of the film to support DAV and veterans. \"These are incredible people that are boots on the ground helping our veterans every day, making sure they have the basic services they need\" such as transportation to doctors’ appointments, etc., he explained. The God Bless the Broken Road cast includes some Hollywood newcomers like former San Diego Chargers player LaDainian Tomlinson. The football star, Cronk beamed, has been \"promoting the film and sharing it with all his friends throughout the NFL world.\" \"He did a fantastic job as Pastor William,\" Cronk said. \"We’re just so blessed to have him lending his name and talents to our production.\" As Amber, Lindsay Pulsipher gives \"a powerful and committed performance in portraying a woman who’s gone through such a terrible loss.\" Cronk is also proud of his \"young spark plug of an actress\" Makenzie Moss, who at just 11 years old pulls off a rather \"weighty\" role as Amber's daughter Bree. The film also features some Hollywood veterans like Robin Givens and Kim Delaney, who Cronk refers to her as \"a huge supporter of our troops.\" Jordin Sparks, who won the sixth season of \"American Idol,\" also appears in the film. In addition to marveling at her powerhouse voice, Cronk describes her as \"an incredible young woman\" who \"loved the message of the movie.\" Andrew Walker stars as Cody Jackson, a race car driver who enters Amber's life and helps she and her family move past their grief and renew their faith in God. God Bless the Broken Road comes out just a few days shy of the September 11 anniversary, a date that was not lost upon the director. \"Every year people remember what a horrible event that was and it kind of ground me every year that freedom isn’t free,\" Cronk explained. \"We want the film to have a maximum impact on culture\" and really feed off of \"the patriotic swell\" from the country. Like many of Cronk's films, his latest includes some heavy faith elements. However, he is hopeful that secular audiences will be just as drawn to the film. \"I hope people explore the themes in the film like hope and finding your way down a broken road, myself included,\" Cronk said. \"It’s nice to know that there’s a bigger plan for you than what’s here.\" God Bless the Broken Road is in theaters September 7.

        "articles": "2018 was a chaotic year. It was a chaotic year for the markets, for domestic and international politics, and for social mores. 2019 promises more of the same, if the end of the prior year was any indicator. And it promises something else: the continued rise of the Wokescolds. Wokescolds are the new representatives of moral panic. We've seen plenty of moral panic before in the United States, from worries about violent video games, to concern about allegations of sex abuse at day care facilities. But never have we seen a moral panic of the stunning breadth of today's woke moral panic. It's a moral panic that insists we change fundamental characteristics of our society, from biology, to language, to politics, to religion, to romantic relations, to art, to comedy. We're told that if we fail to rewrite biology to suggest there are more than two sexes, or if we don't use preferred pronouns rather than biological ones, we will inevitably create emotional and mental instability among certain vulnerable groups. We're told that if we fail to silence members of groups who haven't suffered sufficiently in the United States, we will be contributing to the perpetuation of power hierarchies that target minorities. We're told that if we don't force religious people to violate their own standards in order to cater to those engaging in what they consider to be sinful activity, we will be bolstering religious oppression. We're told that the only proper type of sexual relationship is one initiated via contractual levels of affirmative consent, rather than mere affirmative body language or acquiescence. We're told that \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" and \"The Philadelphia Story\" are deeply troubling hallmarks of our sexist past (modern rap, replete with brutal degradation of women, is just fine, in case you were wondering). And we're told that if we consider politically incorrect jokes funny, we're strengthening regressive stereotypes. If we fail to abide by these new strictures, we will be attacked by the Wokescolds. These \"woke\" inquisitors have apparently mastered the ever-shifting dynamics of leftist power politics and are willing to scour everyone's online history and interpersonal relationships for signs of heresy. Once such heresy is uncovered, the Wokescolds truly go to work: They demand apologies from the supposed sinners and boycotts of those who refuse to disassociate from them. They discourage decent people from speaking up -- better to stay silent so as to avoid the wrath of the Wokescolds. The Wokescolds deliberately pick marginal cases -- cases on which good people may be split. This allows the Wokescolds to consistently narrow the boundaries of safety for those who disagree with them. The latest victim of the Wokescolds: Louis C.K. Now, C.K. has a reprehensible personal history; by his own admission, he used his position of fame and power to lure up-and-coming female comedians backstage, where he would then ask them to watch him touch himself. C.K. has apologized for that behavior. But now he's back on the road, and he's beginning to make jokes again. This must not be allowed, particularly when his jokes are about such taboo topics as gender pronouns and the alleged expertise conferred by experiencing tragedy. And so C.K. has been pronounced Unwoke. See, before his #MeToo moment, he was sufficiently politically leftist to avoid the Wokescold wrath -- after all, he once called Sarah Palin a \"c---.\" But now, C.K. must pay the price for not being sufficiently woke. Those who watch his comedy must be shamed. And we must suggest that he is no longer Funny. Now, the difference between being funny and being Funny is that when you're funny, everyone knows it -- when you're Funny, as defined by critics, you don't have to be funny. You just have to be woke, like the awfully unfunny Hannah Gadsby. Real humor requires only satisfying the Wokescolds. We've all just been misdefining comedy for a few millennia. If all this sounds dull, obnoxious and frustrating, that's because it is. And while the Wokescolds may win temporary victories, those victories will surely be Pyrrhic: As it turns out, we tend to like our biology, language, politics, religion, romantic relationships, art and comedy. The Wokescolds will certainly lose. But not before they destroy a lot of people and fray the social fabric nearly beyond repair.

        "articles": "Honorable mentions: Samantha Bee, CAIR, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Dixie Chicks, Bill Clinton, Ghostbusters 2016, Melissa Harris-Perry, Van Jones, John Kerry, Paul Krugman, Loretta Lynch, Rachel Maddow, Bill Maher, Chris Matthews, Harry Reid, Michael Moore, Michelle Obama, Nancy Pelosi, John Podesta, Harry Reid, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Chuck Schumer, Cora Segal, Martin Sheen, Jill Stein, George Takei, The View, Vox, Elizabeth Warren, Shannon Watts, The Southern Poverty Law Center, Brian Williams, Juan Williams 10) Salon.com: Singling out one liberal rag from legions of contemptuous, dishonest and nasty publications is difficult, but Salon deserves consideration because its website is a walking hate crime against white people. Just look at a tiny sliver of the articles Salon has run this year. The invention of the white working class: The phrase of the year is racist hogwash White is the new white: Too many white people know what they are not, but don’t understand what they are White people can’t hang: Black Americans may be more resilient to stress than white Americans Fighting back against Donald Trump's angry white voters White fragility is real: 4 questions white people should ask themselves during discussions about race White prosperity over racial equality: It’s (still) the American way Stuff white people like: Yoga, tacos and pretending the white supremacy that fuels cultural appropriation doesn’t exist We must shame dumb Trump fans: The white working class are not victims What’s the difference between Salon and a bunch of pathetic Nazis sending out Holocaust memes and ranting about the “Jewish question?” Other than the fact that Salon probably pays better and they’re on different sides, not much. Defining Quote: \"....The intellectual deformities and disfigurements of the average Trump supporter should provoke universal disgust....Most white, working-class voters left the Democratic Party because they did not want to associate with racial minorities, and they did not want to support any candidate who was unwilling to prove – term by term – his contempt for black people. ...It is racial resentment, and little else, that motivates the Trump supporter. ...The best tactic of defeat for Donald Trump is to shame his supporters, not sympathize with them. If support for Trump, or anyone with such ignorance and hatred at the center of his vision for the United States, invites public embarrassment, supporters will begin to cower. If they cower, they lose.\" -- David Masciotra 9) Martin Sheen, Mike Farrell, Loretta Swit And The Other Celebrities Trying To Stop Trump Via Faithless Electors: This is not South America. After a candidate wins an election, we don’t start working on a coup to keep him from taking office. Yet, there was a full-on press by these celebrities and other prominent liberals like Michael Moore to get electors to try to throw the election to someone other than the man who won it. Setting aside the stupidity of setting this precedent (like Republicans wouldn’t try the same thing if it worked) and the very real possibility that bloodshed would result, how can any Americans be so arrogant as to attempt to overturn a legitimate election just because they don’t like the result? Defining video:  Defining Quote: “Was anyone there watching this election? Because if there is one indisputable takeaway from 2016, it’s this: No one gives a West Wing box set what Martin Sheen thinks about politics.” – Ian Tuttle 8) The Cast Of Hamilton: Nobody, especially the mainstream former Republican governor of Indiana, deserves this kind of rudeness from the stage when he’s simply trying to watch a play in peace. Vice-president elect Mike Pence, we welcome you and truly thank you for joining us at Hamilton American Musical. We sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us. What a bunch of….let’s just go with asshats, because I can’t use the words I’d like to use to describe these clowns. Defining Quote: \"When artists perform the venue becomes your home. The audience are your guests. It’s taking unfair advantage of someone who thought they were a protected guest in your home....A guy comes to a Broadway show for a relaxing night out. Instead he gets a lecture from the stage! Not a level playing field. It’s bullying. You don’t single out an audience member and embarrass him from the stage. A terrible precedent to set.” -- Steven Van Zandt 7) Lena Dunham/Amy Schumer: It was hard to make a call between Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer because they’re essentially the same person. They’re both condescending celebrities who are endlessly praised like they’re remarkable figures despite the fact they’re annoying, vacuous and they insist on taking off their clothes every other time they get in front of a camera despite the fact that science has yet to perfect a recipe for eye bleach. Defining Quote #1: “Now that Amy Schumer is playing Barbie I'm more confident that my dream can come true of seeing Oprah Winfrey as the next Spiderman.” – Godfrey Elfwick Defining Quote #2: “Now I can say that I still haven’t had an abortion, but I wish I had.” – Lena Dunham 6) Sally Kohn: CNN Commentator Sally Kohn is an obnoxious mixture of preachiness and almost comically ignorant pronouncements mixed with a whiff of fascism. She probably has some redeeming qualities that explain how she could have a career on TV, but I have no idea what they might be. Defining Quote #1: “Hey @realDonaldTrump, many *progressive Muslims* -- the ones we should support in ideological fight against extremism -- believe in Sharia!!” – Sally Kohn Defining Quote #2: “Feelings are valid. I’m never going to argue with people’s feelings. If they feel like they can no longer speak against positive social change, good,” Kohn said of conservatives who are silenced on college campuses. “They think [diversity] is dumbing down humanity, or the greatness and exceptionalism of America. I’m happy that’s under assault.” -- Sally Kohn Defining Quote #3: “Look, people are only voting for Donald Trump, most of his supporters are only voting for him because he’s a white guy.” – Sally Kohn 5) Rosie O'Donnell: Rosie O’Donnell is a nasty woman who rather famously ended up on the wrong side of a dispute with an even nastier real estate mogul from New York who gave her back every insult that she aimed at him times ten. After realizing she’d never beat Donald Trump, she apparently decided to move on to easier prey: his 10 year old son Barron. In a stunning display of bravery, Rosie suggested on Twitter that Barron might have autism. Rosie then ramped up her trolling of a 10 year old to epic levels by initially responding to calls for an apology with a poorly written poem that included the words, “but this autism subject – had nothing to do with Donald - though i admit he does trigger me in all ways.” Yeah, I’m sure it had nothing to do with Donald Trump. Defining Exchange: Megyn Kelly: “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals.’ Your Twitter account –” Donald Trump: “Only Rosie O’Donnell.” 4) Shaun King: Apparently, the liberal obsession with finding black pundits who have no talent other than the ability to come up with new things to call racist is jejune. Now, with Shaun King’s column in the NY Daily News, we’ve moved on to white guys who are pretending to be black calling everything under the sun racist. Incidentally, I’m just as black as Shaun King; so I can say that. On the other hand, I do have to give Shaun King credit because he was magic in this scene from Tropic Thunder! Defining video:  Defining Quote: “The guy that wrote this story for the New York Daily News, he’s not a journalist. He’s a race hustler from Twitter, from the Black Lives Matter movement who stirs racial controversy to elevate himself. Listen, the guy’s been busted. First of all, he’s white and presenting himself as black. He said that as a child in high school he was allegedly attacked by a group of white people because he was black. Well, he wasn’t black and there were people saying that wasn’t why he was attacked and there’s no proof of it.” – Jason Whitlock 3) Colin Kaepernick: Only in our celebrity-obsessed culture could one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL be rewarded for starting a widespread movement encouraging other pampered athletes to disrespect the flag of the nation that made them so wealthy. Here’s hoping some aspiring Lawrence Taylor gives him the Joe Theismann treatment so he can start his career as an analyst on MSNBC a little early. Defining Quote: “You know, it's sad when you see rich, spoiled athletes that don't recognize what an incredible blessing this country is. You know, it's very easy when you're sitting there rolling in millions of dollars to disrespect this country. I come at it from a different perspective. I come from a perspective of my dad was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba, and America has meant what it's meant to millions across the globe. It's meant hope. It's meant freedom.” – Ted Cruz 2) Barack Obama: Obama’s entire 2016, just like his presidency, was a little more than a string of disasters tied together with vacations, golf and smug lectures to people who quite correctly judged that he was incompetent. Obama started 2016 being humiliated by his pals in Iran who pushed American soldiers around for the fun of it and he ended the year trying to do everything possible to hinder the incoming Trump Administration. In 20 days, he’ll be gone….well, from the White House. Undoubtedly, the worst President in American history will still be out there giving his pompous little speeches to the “bitter clingers” in-between games of golf and getting high when Michelle’s not around. We’re not going to miss you, buddy. Defining Quote: “The most important political story during the nearly eight years of the Obama presidency is how that presidency delivered a neutron-bomb strike to his party. Obama and the political structure of America have been left standing — but nearly 1,000 Democratic officeholders have been defeated.” – John Podhoretz 1) Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton is unlikable, hopelessly corrupt, relentlessly dishonest, arrogant, criminally incompetent, too feeble to be President and has a weird laugh. This is a woman who should have been running for President of her cell block, not President of the United States. That was bad enough. But, listening to the media force feed us a steady diet of, “Isn’t she wonderful for walking up the steps by herself” and “Wow, Hillary’s existence certainly is a wonderful treat for every woman who ever lived” was maddening. Defining quote #1: “I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once the first time she says I'm running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion.” – Hillary’s aide John Podesta in an email revealed by WikiLeaks Defining Quote #2: “To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it.” -- Hillary Clinton Defining Quote #3: “’Why aren't I 50 points ahead,' you might ask.” – Hillary Clinton expressing bafflement that she wasn’t cruising to an easy victory. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Many people seem shocked at the recent savagery of a mob of students at Middlebury College, who rioted to prevent Charles Murray from addressing a student group who had invited him to speak. They also inflicted injuries requiring hospitalization on a woman from the faculty who was with him. Where have all these shocked people been all these years? What happened at Middlebury College has been happening for decades, all across the country, from Berkeley to Harvard. Moreover, even critics of the Middlebury College rioters betray some of the same irresponsible mindset as that of the young rioters. The moral dry rot in academia — and beyond — goes far deeper than student storm troopers at one college. Frank Bruni of the New York Times, for example, while criticizing the rioters, lent credence to the claim that Charles Murray was \"a white nationalist.\" Similar — and worse — things have been said, in supposedly reputable publications, by people who could not cite one statement from any of Dr. Murray's books that bears any resemblance to their smears. Academia, however, is ground zero in the war against people whose ideas go against the current political correctness. The virtual monopoly of the political left, on campuses across the country, allows all sorts of things to be attributed to people the left disagrees with, irrespective of whether those people have ever said anything resembling what they are alleged to have said. The professors don't usually riot against people whose ideas they disagree with, because they can just dismiss those ideas, with some characterization that there is no one on hand to challenge. Professor William Julius Wilson of Harvard, for example, said of Justice Clarence Thomas, \"He'll say he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps. I say I was in the right place at the right time.\" Just where did Justice Thomas say that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps? The central theme of his autobiography, titled \"My Grandfather's Son,\" credits the wisdom of the grandfather who raised him as what saved him. Nuns who taught him in school were brought to Washington, at his expense, to be present to see him sworn in as a Justice of the Supreme Court, to see that their dedicated efforts on his behalf had not been in vain. But has anyone ever asked Professor Wilson on just what he based his claim about Justice Thomas? The central tragedy of academia today is that you don't have to have anything on which to base dismissals of people and ideas you disagree with. This attitude is not unique to William Julius Wilson or to Harvard. On the west coast, Professor Lanny Ebenstein of the University of California at Santa Barbara has included economists Stephen Moore and Walter Williams, as well as television host John Stossel, among those \"committed to the welfare of the top few.\" Professor Ebenstein has every right to disagree with these individuals on economic or other issues. But that is very different from attributing to them a commitment to \"the welfare of the top few.\" It so happens that I have read books by all three, without finding any preoccupation with the welfare of the affluent or the rich. I have known Walter Williams for more than 40 years. When we both lived on the east coast, we and our wives often met socially. In all that time, neither in public nor in private did I ever hear Walter Williams express the slightest concern for the welfare of the affluent or the rich. Innumerable times I heard him focus his concern on the well-being of people like himself, from a poverty background. That concern was also expressed in deeds as well as words. But who is going to ask Professor Ebenstein to cite the basis for his claim? Why should we expect students to welcome debate about differences of opinion, when so many of their professors seem to think cheap shot dismissals are all you need? Lacking their professors' verbal dexterity or aura of authority, students use cruder methods of dismissing things they disagree with. So long as academia talks demographic \"diversity\" and practices groupthink when it comes to ideas, we have little reason to expect better of student mobs that riot with impunity.

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File School is back in session folks, and the latest leftist lesson this semester is that if you enjoy a tasty, mouthwatering juicy chicken sandwich from Chick-Fil-A then you're a bigot. In fact, some professors at the University of Kansas feel so strongly that the Christian company is a hatemongering behemoth of evil, that they are demanding their school boycott and remove the sandwich chain from their campus. The Kansas City Star reports that Chick-Fil-A previously had a spot tucked away in the basement of an obscure building on campus. But, after a new contract, the eatery was moved to a new and improved location. The business was also given a new sponsorship via \"Chick-Fil-A coin flip\" before every home football game for the next three years. KU’s Sexuality & Gender Diversity Faculty and Staff Council sent a letter to Chancellor Doug Girod this week, saying \"KU granted Chick-fil-A, a bastion of bigotry, a prime retail location in the heart of our campus.\" \"Moving Chick-fil-A to the Union and granting it a role at the start of all home football games violates the feelings of safety and inclusion that so many of us have striven to create, foster, and protect on campus, and sends a message that the Union, KU Athletics, and the administration at large are more concerned about money and corporate sponsorship than the physical, emotional, and mental well being of marginalized and LGBTQ people,\" the professors added. \"The culture of Chick-fil-A fosters hate and discrimination on multiple levels. In short, Chick-fil-A on KU’s campus stands in direct contrast to the university’s mission of fostering a multicultural, inclusive environment,\" they declared. The founder of Chick-Fil-A, Truett Cathy, was a devout Christian who believed in traditional marriage. Every employee is trained in line with Christian teaching. The alleged culture of hate the professors accuse the sandwich chain of creating includes employees who change customer's tires in the drive-thru lane, feed disabled customers, and always say \"My pleasure\" when a patron says \"Thank you.\" .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Every now and then I have to apologize for going a little bit over the top. Recently, I did that when I suggested we should eliminate all university majors ending with the word “studies.” Obviously, that’s a little extreme. So I apologize. Instead, I am going to suggest that we eliminate some of the “studies” majors and just rename the rest. I write today to suggest that the first one we should rename is Women’s Studies. From now on, I propose that we call it “Hysterical Women’s Studies.” My reasons for the immodest proposal are based on direct and indirect experience with so-called scholars in Women’s Studies and with their students. Around the time I started writing about the suspect nature of Women’s Studies I learned of a director of a university Women’s Center named Sally Jacobsen. She became so hysterical when she saw a pro-life display that she actually exploded in anger, physically destroyed the display, and stole the Christian crosses, which she had just broken. This was long before my own university got a Women’s Studies Department. But it didn’t take long for Women’s Studies professors and majors at my own university to become just as hysterical as professor Jacobsen. A few examples from the last academic year will be sufficient to make my point. *A lesbian women’s studies professor (please pardon the redundancy) falsely accused a professor of violating Title IX because he refused to tell the dean the name of a student who had been previously raped while off campus. Instead, he told the local D.A. In other words, he insisted on diverting the case to the real court system and away from the campus judiciary. Predictably, the lesbian professor went hysterical. *The Women’s Studies Student Association was asked by Ratio Christi to attend a pro-life event. They responded by going hysterical and threatening them with prosecution in the campus judiciary simply for inviting them to dialogue. If these women cannot find employment after college they would make really good car alarms. If you get anywhere near them they start to make loud irritating noises, otherwise known as harassment complaints. *In the spring, these brilliant women’s studies students decided to form a human chain around a pro-life display in order to keep pro lifers from passing out literature on abortion. After the police were called to keep them behind a barricade a pro-life professor referred to them as caged animals. Predictably, some went hysterical and made harassment charges against the professor. It’s just what they are programmed to do. Or maybe they were born with the hysterical gene. *After the Dean dismissed the student harassment complaints, the angry feminists went on the previously mentioned pro-life professor’s Facebook page in an effort to get re-offended and “harassed.” Having failed in their efforts to file a formal complaint, they went to the media and complained that they felt “unsafe” on campus as a result of his off campus Facebook posts. The on-camera interview did not go so well and caused viewers to ridicule them for being hysterical. So they became frustrated and even more hysterical. *Next, the hysterical feminists resurrected the aforementioned lesbian women’s studies professor’s false accusation that the professor had violated Title IX (simply because he reported a rape to a D.A. instead of a Dean). In the new and even more hysterical version of the story, the professor did not report the rape to the D.A. He suppressed it altogether. This paved the way for more hysteria. *Next, an emotionally unhinged Islamic feminist elevated the hysteria by accusing the aforementioned professor of being a “pro rape” activist. This is despite the fact that the professor has consistently supported the death penalty for aggravated rape. In contrast, these feminists only support the death penalty for unborn children. *Bringing things to an emotional climax, the unhinged feminist launched an Internet jihad by starting a petition accusing the “pro rape” professor of having the university LGBT director fired for her sexual orientation and political beliefs. This was just a few weeks after the LGBT director publicly boasted that she had run a pro-life group off campus for sharing their political beliefs. I guess the “B” really does stand for having it both ways. Maybe it stands for “bipolar.” *This petition caused the feminist hysteria to be supplemented by homosexual hysteria. In the midst of the hysteria, these students sent profane messages to the professor, attempted to hack his email account, bombarded his Rate My Professor page with fake reviews, and topped it off by sending homosexual pornography to his workplace, which actually is sexual harassment. Once again, love wins! *When the now-former LGBT director later issued a statement saying she voluntarily resigned and was not fired for her sexual orientation or her political beliefs, the petition was finally shut down. Unfortunately, 3,000 people were tricked into signing it based on false and defamatory information. *The unhinged feminist who launched the Internet jihad never apologized for the defamation. In fact, no one ever apologized for the profanity, the hacking attempts, the fake student reviews, or the unwanted pornographic emails. But at least the hysteria was over. Just kidding. The hysteria was not over. *After being embarrassed for joining an Internet jihad without reason the hysterical feminists were naturally embarrassed. So they took their hysteria to the chancellor’s office where they had a sit-in and demanded to see the university’s highest-ranking officer. Predictably, the cowardly Chancellor Bill Sederburg let them into his office. I suppose hysteria wins. Better hashtag that one, too. While all of this was going on at my school, there was even greater hysteria exhibited by Dr. Mireille Miller-Young, a feminist studies professor at the University of California – Santa Barbara (UCSB). She actually became so hysterical when someone disagreed with her on the abortion issue that she physically attacked a sixteen-year-old pro-lifer handing out anti-abortion literature on her campus. After physically attacking the minor, the hysterical professor told police she had a “moral right” to do so. But when the case went to trial, the jury convicted her of theft for stealing the teenager’s anti-abortion sign (and also battery for attacking her). Ok, I guess sometimes hysteria loses. To make matters worse, 12 professors sent letters to the judge vouching for her character and describing her as “open-minded.” One lauded her “kindness combined with her commitment to justice.” No one in the administration ever apologized to the public for Miller-Young’s hysterical and literal assault on free speech. Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Michael D. Young even sent a letter to students noting, “During the last few weeks, UCSB has been visited by various anti-abortion crusaders.” He even called the assault victim a “provocateur.” In other words, the minor deserved to be attacked by the professor. She started it. Small wonder that there is such a pathetic environment for free speech on our college campuses. This kind of feminist hysteria is no longer simply tolerated. It is actually encouraged in the inverted moral universe of hire education (Note that the occasional ms-spelling of words is intentional). Hard working taxpayers should not be asked to fund so-called academic programs that take confused young women and turn them into hysterical zealots who divide their time between killing unborn children and killing free expression. But there is little chance that academia will come to its senses and abandon illegitimate academic pursuits. The least we can hope for is to put the word “Hysterical” before “Women’s Studies” on their degrees and college transcripts. It would serve as a warning for future employers who would prefer to keep hysterical bigotry masked as feminism out of their workplace. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "What if it's not injustice that has led so many blacks across America to feel disenfranchised? What if it's judgment? Last week on two separate occasions guests on Sean Hannity's radio program reiterated Jesse Jackson's decades old mantra that \"blacks can't be racist because we have no institutional power.\" This may be a clandestine way to excuse blacks for destroying cities like Ferguson, MO in the name of justice for Michael Brown, but it's hardly worth addressing seriously. Unknown to many is the fact that blacks hold more government jobs by percentage than any other ethnicity. In an article entitled \"Government Job Cuts Threaten the Black Middle Class\" on npr.org, \"Blacks are thirty percent more likely than non-blacks to work in the public sector, according to the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Labor Research and Education. And \"roughly 21 percent of black workers are public employees compared with 16.3 percent of non-blacks.\" In other words, blacks are the institution! We would be better off if blacks were more concerned about the injustices that occur within our own communities than looking at external factors. Government dependency has contributed to broken homes, multiple baby-daddy's, black-on-black crime, jobless men and most importantly, an abandonment of biblical values in black communities. Yet these issues are continuously ignored or excused within the community. Whitey makes for a great scapegoat but they're not to blame for our problems today. Blacks can be racist just like anyone else if and when we allow unforgiveness to take root in our hearts. So where did this ridiculous notion that blacks can't be racist come from? The tipping point seems to have been when blacks decidedly chose the policies of LBJ's War on Poverty over God's divine plan of family. The floodgates to despotism and desperation at the expense of destiny were opened wide. Racism is a condition of the heart! Only a just and fair God can rightly examine the individual heart- not phony civil rights activists. Imagine a Black Panther standing before God on judgment day asking for his hatred towards whites and Jews to be forgiven based solely on the argument he had \"no institutional power.\" It's ridiculous isn't it? Each man will give an account to God for his own life. We mustn't allow America's race-baiters to control this argument! Black female rapper Azealia Banks was quoted in an interview with Playboy magazine saying \"I hate everything about this country. Like, I hate fat white Americans. All the people who are crunched into the middle of America, the real fat and meat of America, are these racist conservative white people who live on their farms.\" Wouldn't it have been nice to hear black leftist demand an apology from her? If we're to love our neighbor, shouldn't all racially divisive language be unacceptable from anyone of any color? When a young black female at a Brooklyn McDonald's was beaten senselessly by at least four other black females recently, it would have been cool to see one of the dozens of black spectators step in to break up the fight. Instead, the onlookers cheered on the beating! The women brawled like men, and the men sat by like helpless women. And we have the audacity to be worried about white policemen!? Where is our humanity towards each other? What a pleasant surprise it would have been to see a \"civil rights leader\" demand peace despite the perceived grievances of the black community in Ferguson, Missouri when Attorney General Eric Holder's report concluded Officer Darren Wilson was justified in shooting Michael Brown. Instead we witnessed a black Ferguson sniper shoot two innocent police officers brought in from another department to help protect the people of the town against a potential second wave of riots. As long as blacks are allowed to hide behind terms like \"institutional racism,\" they'll continue to evade any fault or guilt regarding racial issues brought on by themselves, including riots. My eighth grade science teacher Mr. Royce addressed a mostly black and Mexican student body during an assembly after a large brawl between gang members took place at my school. In his frustration he stated, \"we run to fights but walk to class.\" That's stuck with me over the years. In addition, we scream for civil rights, just don't expect us to act civil! We demand respect just don't ask us to respect ourselves! We vote, just don't expect us to hold politicians accountable! We collect welfare checks, just don't ask us to collect job applications! Sadly, the gift of freedom given to all Americans by God will continue to allude blacks like utopia does liberals. Blacks don't have the moral authority to determine whom can or cannot be racist. God does! Perhaps if we begin treating each other better, cops would have less need to police our communities.

        "articles": "If there is one law of politics the Clintons know better than anyone, it is the power of perception. Their masterful ability to twist, bend, and manipulate the truth -- even something as basic as the word “is” -- has afforded America’s Power Couple a Teflon-like resistance to scandal and corruption that is the envy of less savvy politicos. In Clinton World --where both public and professional personas follow a meticulously crafted storyline that has been thoroughly polled and vetted -- nothing is left unscripted; least of all, Hillary’s political swan song. The location of New York’s tiny Roosevelt Island for Hillary’s first major rally of her 2016 presidential campaign, offers a small taste of how heavily the Clinton handbook will play into her campaign. Not to be interrupted by the riff-raff of New York City, limited access to “Hillary Island” allowed for total attendance control; described by The Daily Beast as a “pleasant little police state.” The island’s namesake, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and its Four Freedoms Park provided the perfect backdrop for Hillary’s reinvention from cloistered liberal elitist to American populist hero. If successful, the transmogrification of one of the Washington Establishment’s most entrenched fixtures into a working class hero, will be the Clinton PR machine’s magnum opus. However, even it faces the limitations of how much the public is willing to swallow in order to believe such a contrived narrative. In the end, Hillary’s greatest hurdle to the White House may prove to be Clinton herself. Indeed, “Hillary vs. Hillary” may prove just as exciting a bout as the likely Main Event between her and the GOP nominee. Unlike Barack Obama in 2008, Hillary does not have the benefit of a clean slate when it comes to public service on the national stage. Whereas Obama could skate by on superficial campaign promises, Hillary’s new populist rhetoric clearly clashes with a very public legacy both in office and out, that is decidedly Establishment in nature. In fact, little about the Clintons’ posh lifestyle, and their phobia of anything outside their neatly manicured sphere of influence, demonstrates any genuine connection with “the people” Hillary now champions. If a campaign could be run on clever Internet memes and social media alone, she would prefer such managed, strategic “interactions” to the unpredictability of public appearances. Such a framework reduces the risk of uncomfortable outbursts from a clearly out-of-practice Clinton, like that in New Hampshire recently when she barked at an adoring fan to get to the “back of the line” when he asked for an autograph. Even Hillary’s campaign speech on Saturday, light as it was on substance, illustrated how out-of-touch she is with her own policies as a “leader.” Not wanting to waste an opportunity to slam the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling, Hillary called for constitutional action to “stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money,” which she claims is “corrupting our political process.” Never mind that Hillary is facing serious ethical questions about her own “endless flow of secret, unaccountable” foreign money, totaling in the tens of millions of dollars into the coffers of the Clinton Foundation, even as she negotiated with those very countries as Secretary of State. Hillary also remains stubbornly tone deaf to the criticism of calling for greater transparency, when, as Secretary of State, she intentionally ignored such laws. To the average citizen, who expects government officials to be accountable to the law, such hypocrisy is obvious; in Clinton World, Hillary is the victim. Instead of responding in a manner reflective of a true People’s Champion, Hillary treated the e-mail scandal as a joke; a “distraction” orchestrated by her enemies. For those who have followed the Clintons over the years, it was simply another vintage-Clinton maneuver; one which National Journal writer and long-time Clinton reporter Ron Fournier called the “predictable, paint-by-numbers response from the Bill and Hillary Clinton political operation” -- deny, deflect, and demean. The next 16 months for Team Hillary will be less about any substantive plans for rescuing America from the abyss; and more about a continuous reeducation campaign to persuade voters she is not the out-of-touch elitist from Chappaqua who has not driven a car in 20 years, but instead, the hip, pantsuit-wearing grandma ready to carry the presidential banner for all American women into the Oval Office. There is an Aesop’s Fable that comes to mind here. A farmer finds a viper freezing in the snow and places it in his shirt to save it from dying. Revived by the warmth, the viper resorts to its true nature, turning on its benefactor with a fatal bite. “Oh!” cries the farmer, “I am rightly served for pitying a scoundrel.” Some may genuinely buy into Hillary’s conversion fairytale, and others may feel she deserves the White House as a matter of Manifest Destiny. But the essence of the Clinton fable is well-established and no amount of pity, or forced perception, will change the inevitability of corruption and ethical misconduct to come with another Clinton in the White House. They cannot help it. It is their nature. Shame on us if we succumb to its siren song. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Editor's Note: Tony Perkins, President Of The Family Research Council, co-athored this column. Like two speeding trains heading toward the same collapsed bridge, the dangers and failures of Barack Obama’s foreign, economic, and social policies are heading rapidly toward implosion. Our vital security interests, our economic well-being, our religious liberties, and the very fabric of American family life are all at grave risk of becoming casualties of the extreme ideological agenda and simple incompetence of the current Administration. First, with respect to foreign policy: Watching the spread of ISIS throughout the Middle East is like watching the growth of a cancer. Yet President Obama says he still has no fully-formed strategy with which to deal with it. Instead, his focus has been on Iran, to which end he is encouraging Senate approval of a plan that would give Iran the continued capacity to produce nuclear weapons in coming years. The irony is that Iran is the epicenter of Islamic terrorism. Hezbollah, Hamas, Al-Qaeda, Shiite jihadism, the “Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,” and other violent Muslim extremist groups all find a base of support in Tehran. The idea that the United States would endorse a weak agreement with a power as dangerous as this is chilling. Congress must demand a non-nuclear Iran because a nuclear Iran is an existential threat to Israel and other U.S. allies in the Middle East. Ultimately, an Iran with nuclear weapons is a threat to America, as well: Technology is such that a small nuclear device, made in Iran and distributed through its terror network, could reach our shores in suitcase. Compounding this is that there is NO evidence the Iranian regime has made a strategic decision to give up the pursuit of nuclear weapons. And the regime's track record on transparency is no better than the Obama Administration’s. Past experience makes clear Iran cannot be trusted. Additionally, Iran is emblematic of multiple failures in Mr. Obama’s foreign policy, from Vladimir Putin’s recent announcement that Russia will begin building more nuclear weapons to China’s resurgence. In the words of respected foreign policy expert Leslie Gelb, “the Obama team lacks the basic instincts and judgment necessary to conduct U.S. national security policy in the next two years.” On the domestic front, things are no better. With respect the President’s most prized economic policy achievement, the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”), millions of Americans have found it anything but affordable with their premiums rising an average of ten percent. Now, Obamacare is headed for a constitutional collision. The Supreme Court is expected to rule against this administration in King v. Burwell. If the administration loses, and the subsidies are ruled unconstitutional, this will make Obamacare financially unobtainable for millions of hard-pressed Americans. According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums in the 34 states currently receiving federal Obamacare subsidies would see premiums rise by, minimally, 132 percent (Alaska) to as high as 650 percent (Mississippi). The disruption caused by Obamacare’s likely collapse will only augment the President’s failure to address the impending collapse of our “entitlement” system of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The nation’s fiscal forecast, already ominously overcast, will become outright stormy if action is not taken, the sooner the better, to remedy our inescapable economic problems. Then there’s the President’s apparently highest social policy goal, nationwide legalization of marriage between two same-gendered partners. If the Court endorses the Obama agenda redefining marriage the social and religious fallout will be immense. The disintegration of the intact biological family will accelerate and the religious liberties of tens of millions of Americans will be placed at risk. As his Solicitor General admitted during April’s same-sex “marriage” hearing before the Court, the tax exempt status of churches and religious colleges will be placed at risk if they don’t accommodate themselves to a newly-invented constitutional “right” for same-sex partners legally to marry. Mr. Obama is steeped in a hard-Left ideology so rigid that he seems immune to the political realities careening toward a very troubling collision that will affect all aspects of American life, now and in the years to come. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "“What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.”(Ecclesiastes 1:9) The Apostle Paul likely wrote his letter to the Romans about 25 years after Christ’s death and resurrection (sometime between A.D. 55-57). Throughout the book of Romans, Paul warned of God’s unfolding wrath against the Roman Empire – indeed, all of humanity – for mankind’s embrace and practice of pagan morality. Approach Paul’s words with a modicum of objectivity and the reader is left with this dreadful realization: The words of Christ’s hand-picked messenger likewise paint an eerily accurate portrait of America, A.D. 2013. The negligible difference is that ancient pagan morality has been sanitized with a new euphemism: postmodern “progressivism.” It is unbridled hubris that presumes America – lest she depart the wide path to ancient Rome – will not suffer that empire’s same fate. “The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them,” he wrote. “For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities – his eternal power and divine nature – have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.” (Romans 1:18-20) Of course, an entire book could be written on this passage alone, but, essentially, Paul is noting that knowledge of God’s existence, eternal power, divine nature and moral law are self-evident. His truths are written on the hearts of every man, woman and child – Jew, Christian and pagan alike. Those who deny this reality are “without excuse.” Yet, excuses we make. Pull your eyes from your smartphone, America. Look around you. God’s wrath is “being revealed from heaven” once more. “For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles. Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator – who is forever praised. Amen.” (Romans 1:21-25) Indeed, there is nothing new under the sun. Sexual impurity in all its ugly forms – fornication, adultery, homosexuality, pornography, et al. – is celebrated by these “progressive” “fools.” American culture revels in the degrading of our bodies while purity is mocked. God has given us over to sinful desires. Furthermore, while good earthly stewardship is a sound biblical principle, the pantheism and idolatry of which Paul warned (worship of creation and/or false idols over the Creator) prospers yet today in its contemporary, totalitarian forms: radical environmentalism and new ageism. “Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones (lesbianism). In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.” (Romans 1:26-27) Was Paul rebuking “progressives” on the U.S. Supreme Court, President Obama, liberals in Congress and other cheerleaders for these “shameful lusts” and “unnatural relations” – or was he just describing the disproportionately powerful and “inflamed-with-lust” homosexual lobby they represent? Probably both. Either way, God’s “due penalty” is non-discriminating. America’s official endorsement of “gay marriage,” “gay pride,” homosexualist indoctrination in our schools, “transgender” bathroom bills and bans on counseling to help with unwanted same-sex attraction will not end well. Ask the Romans. “Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.” (Romans 1:28-32) Where to begin. We have arrived. Shame on you, America. Our children – our adults – are depraved. They are “occupied” by envy. They attack innocent people, beating and killing them for sport. They murder one another in the streets without love or mercy. They disobey, gossip, slander and hate God. They are insolent, arrogant, boastful “little monsters.” They invent ways of doing evil. Hannah Montana is what America once was. MTV Miley is America today. She “evolved” because we “evolved.” You saw it on display. It’s ugly. It’s Satanic. It’s “progressive.” Still, though we have become a Romans 1 nation and, absent widespread spiritual revival, will fall as did Rome, those who embrace and follow truth – who is Jesus the Christ – are a Romans 8 people: “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death. For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.” (Romans 8:1-4) That’s the good news. And that’s a column for another day. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

By the way, put this in context. This is on the heels of what happened in Puerto Rico when we took a lot of heat for not wanting to give a bunch aid to Puerto Rico because we thought that place was corrupt.

So put that as your context,\" he said. \"He's like look, this is a corrupt place; I don't want to send them a bunch of money and have them waste it, have them spend it, have them use it to line their own pockets. \"Plus, I'm not sure that the other European countries are helping them out either. So we actually looked at that during that time before when the money--when we cut the money off, before the money actually flowed,, because the money flowed by the end of the fiscal year--we actually did an analysis of what other countries were doing in terms of supporting Ukraine. \"And what we found out was that--and I can't remember if it's zero or near zero dollars from any European countries for lethal aid. You've heard the president say this, that we give them tanks and the other countries give them pillows. That's absolutely right, that as vocal as the Europeans are about supporting Ukraine, they are really, really stingy when it comes to lethal aid. And they weren't helping Ukraine. And then still to this day are not. And the president did not like that. \"I know it's a long answer to your question, but I'm still going. \"So that was--those were the driving factors. Did he also mention to me in the past the--the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that's it, and that's why we held up the money.\" A reporter pushed back and said it sounded like he was saying it was a quid pro quo. \"We do that all the time,” he replied. \"We were holding up money at the same time for, what was it, the Northern Triangle countries. We were holding up aid at the Northern Triangle countries so that they -- so that they would change their policies on immigration.\" He continued: “Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy. That is going to happen. Elections have consequences, and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.” .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Source: (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) A common technique to convince us that an idea has validity is to impress with highly-credentialed individuals, with an air of bipartisanship, that obviously have ruminated on the proposal in a way we commoners cannot possibly even conceive. Recently, a large group (the larger the group, the more we are supposed to swoon) threw their support behind a carbon tax. Reading and analyzing what they purport brought me to think: how can all these people be so wrong? And they are. A carbon tax is aimed at energy sources that are carbon based. The Carbon Tax Center website (www.carbontax.org) will provide you information about a carbon tax. Understand that the site is written and maintained by people in favor of establishing a carbon tax. As stated by Dr. Matthais Kakuhl: “It is a tax that increases revenue without significantly altering the economy while simultaneously promoting objectives of climate change policy.” As stated on the Carbon Tax Center website, “A carbon tax is the fairest, most effective, most efficient single policy tool in a fight for a habitable climate.” The question is whether all that is true. Apparently, some very smart people believe it to be true. They wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal. The authors included such luminaries as Paul Volcker, three other former Fed chairs, two former Treasury secretaries, 12 former chairs of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, and 27 Nobel laureates in Economics. That is a lot of brain power to contradict. The authors proposed five points in their column. They state the carbon tax “is the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary.” They say “a carbon tax should increase every year until emissions reductions goals are met and be revenue neutral.” They go on to state that the tax will “replace the need for various carbon regulations that are less efficient.” This would create an incentive for other nations “to adopt similar carbon pricing.” Finally, they say “To maximize the fairness and political viability of a rising carbon tax, all the revenue should be returned directly to U.S. citizens through equal lump-sum rebates.” If only some of these concepts were not just theories and were not highly impractical in the real world. When the applications fail and we are left holding the bag, then they would just say “Sorry; we meant to do well.” Let’s start in the middle – the concept that is the best rationale for the tax – replacing inane regulations that would be harmful and counterproductive. This is an excellent idea if somehow, we could be assured it would happen. Once the tax is put in place, there is zero incentive for the legislators not to legislate. If they put in a clause that said any additional legislation regarding the matter would trigger an immediate dissolution of the tax system, we could be assured this would work. That would never happen; and, if the clause was inserted, how would that stop legislators from just naming their changes as something else and saying the legislation was not what it truly is? Yellow is blue and blue is white. They do this all the time: for example, “This is just a fee, it is not a tax increase.” Additionally, the bureaucracy could put in regulations that would fly under the radar. Or we could have a president who says, “I am doing this. If you don’t like it, sue me.” That never happened, right? The first two points are tied together. They said it is the most effective way. That assumes the free market will restrict the usage with higher prices, thus quelling demand. At least they are honest. Their intention is to scale up the tax until it hurts so bad, we will all abandon our cars and walk to work or get bicycles or maybe those new cool scooters. This assumes that because of the new tax, we will abandon even further our use of gas-driven cars and all be driving Teslas. That would be fine if the car companies could efficiently produce those vehicles and make them affordable to the masses. They just are not now. They are mostly toys to assuage the individuals wealthy enough to afford them. Not to mention, we will have all those solar panels and windmills producing enough energy since the Left has basically banned nuclear energy. If only that could meet the needs of Americans. Those forms of energy are nowhere close and will not be in the foreseeable future. The fourth point is the most idealistic. This would create an incentive for other countries. I agree it is not an excuse that since China is a disgusting country fouling up the planet with waste and smog that we should not strive to do better. We have done better recently excluding 2018, apparently while even the countries remaining as signatories to the Paris Accord have not. We all know the secret to the other countries following us in the Paris Accord was a piggybank mostly funded by you know who – Americans. To get countries to follow our lead, we will have to pay them off and pay them off and pay them off. The last point of equal repayment of the funds in rebates is so the initiative is revenue neutral. First, this would be a massive redistribution of wealth. As stated on the Carbon Tax Center website, more successful people use more energy; thus, they would only be getting back the amount that a lesser user of energy receives; not equal to their own usage. Second, how long do you think it would be before the rebates would become income qualified? As someone who knows the tax system well and knows almost all finances today are run through the tax system – almost all credits and government programs including Medicare are income qualified. It is no wonder that the executive director of the Carbon Tax Center told me he thought that seeking bipartisan support for this proposal was a “fool’s errand” despite support from some elder statesmen of the Republican Party. In my opinion, based on our past experience with proposals like this, we would just be fools.

        "articles": "Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling is being run out of professional basketball for racist comments he made in private while both Democrats and Republicans rightly cheer. Racism, many in the media would tell you, is no longer acceptable in America. But that’s a lie. Racism in America is dying, but it’s not dead yet. It’s being kept alive by the Democratic Party. I recently went to New York to see Bryan Cranston on Broadway play President Lyndon Baines Johnson in All The Way. It was an excellent performance, but it was an incredibly well-crafted piece of propaganda. The hero, LBJ, has to fight racist Republicans and many Democrats to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He feels compelled to do this because it’s right and it finished the work of JFK, whom he replaced after Kennedy was assassinated. But although JFK is routinely cited as a civil rights hero, it’s rarely noted he did little more than pay lip service to the cause, constantly putting off the NAACP because he was afraid it would hurt him in the 1964 election. In other words, President Kennedy put his own political fortune ahead of what was right. Not exactly the quality one seeks in a hero. But LBJ would not be stopped, at least according to the play. And he really does deserve credit for pushing what JFK wouldn’t try. But the cooperation of Republicans, without whom Democrats would have filibustered and blocked the bill, is downplayed. This is how history is written – not in books or the public record, but in the minds of a disconnected public that gets its news from pop culture. LBJ’s racism also is downplayed – he’s simply a man working to do what is right, though often in a Machiavellian way. The play refers to LBJ’s Great Society, but only in passing – it focuses on the Civil Rights Act and his election in November 1964. This leaves the audience with an incomplete picture of LBJ’s legacy, one that perpetuates the myth of an altruistic hero. But that altruistic hero went on to implement anti-poverty programs that have trapped generations of Americans in poverty and created a loyal base of voters for his party that successive Democrats have exploited to obtain and maintain power. “Vote for us and we’ll give you stuff” has been the subtext of every major Democratic campaign of the last 40 years. In the black community, this scare tactic has been cynically married to the charge of racism, creating a 1-2 punch that ensures the Democrats’ power base, even though blacks’ unemployment rate stands at 11.6 now – nearly twice that of all Americans and higher than any other ethnic group. How’s that loyalty working out? When Republicans attempt to reform anti-poverty programs, liberals cry racism. Why? Because they equate “poor” with “black” – even though there are more white people on welfare than any other race. It’s Pavlovian – but in this case liberals are both Pavlov and the dog. Democrats have locked up the black vote for generations not because they’ve solved any problems in the black community – those they’ve attempted to address have done nothing but get worse – but because they’ve cynically, and diabolically injected race into every issue and labeled with “otherness,” anyone who strays from the orthodoxy they’ve deemed “acceptable thought” for black Americans. Where Sterling was run out of public life for his racist comments, elected Democrats face no repercussions for theirs. The late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., a former leader of the KKK, twice was elected the majority leader in the U.S. Senate and served a 6-year stint as, ironically, minority leader in between. Add Harry Reid, Joe Biden, Bill Clinton and countless others to the list of elected Democrats who’ve said things just as racist as Sterling, yet faced no consequences. And that list continually grows. In one of the most disgusting displays of recent liberal bigotry, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., called Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas an “Uncle Tom” on a radio show for the New Nation Of Islam. Hilariously, the host immediately said, “You said that, I didn’t.” You know it’s bad when the New Nation Of Islam host distances himself from a bigoted comment. When confronted about his hateful comments the next day by CNN, Thompson was unrepentant, saying he could call Thomas an “Uncle Tom” because he’s black too. \"Well if you look at his decisions on the court, they have been adverse to the minority community,” Thompson said. “And the people I represent have a real issue with an African American not being sensitive to those issues.\" In other words, Thompson’s problem is Clarence Thomas takes his oath to the Constitution too seriously and should ignore it to “favor” people who share his skin color. To liberals, people are their skin color first, and that should dictate their thoughts and behavior. To stray from that is somehow a betrayal. It’s the basest form of racism, even if the victim and the perpetrator share the same melanin. But was Thompson rebuked for his assault? Did Democratic leadership criticize him for accusing Thomas of leaving the liberals’ mental plantation? Quite the opposite. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., the No.3 Democrat in the House, was asked on MSNBC’s Morning Joe if he agreed Thomas was an “Uncle Tom” for not adhering to liberal orthodoxy. His reply was “Well, I don’t know.” Let that sink in. This is the assistant Democratic leader, not some backbencher. Clyburn’s refusal to rebuke Thompson is an implicit embrace of what Thompson said. And, more importantly, think of what Thompson’s words imply – if you are black and you stray from the liberal/progressive ideology, you’re betraying your race. To progressives, you aren’t an individual, you’re your skin. Clarence Thomas isn’t a man, he’s a black man. He isn’t an American, he’s an African American. It’s the prefix, not the person, that matters. That, at its core, is racism. Donald Sterling never will be accepted in polite society again, and rightfully so. He may even be forced to sell his NBA team for his private racist comments. Meanwhile, Democrats will continue to exude racism publicly, and proudly, in the hope that it scares the hell out of voters, particularly minority voters, and keeps them from realizing their lives depend more on who they are and what they do than on any politician or party. Democrats will continue to convince people that even though their lives haven’t improved after decades of loyally voting for Democrats and their ever-increasing government programs, the alternative is worse, so don’t try it. It’s divisive, cynical, cruel, un-American and racist. It’s also the path to, the reason for, and the basis of Democrats’ power. As long as it works, they’ll never stop doing it.

        "articles": "Editor's Note: This column was co-authored by Heidi Huber, founder of Operation Opt Out Ohio. Parents across the nation are in open revolt against the testing mania that has seized public schools under No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the Common Core national standards. In some states, thousands of students — 200,000 in New York alone — are refusing the “mandatory” assessments. One would think the Washington politicos who are writing the NCLB reauthorization bill would take note of this widespread rebellion and would ease — or better still, eliminate — the federal testing requirements. But unlike the repentant thief who returns the loot, the federal government never willingly relinquishes power it has stolen from the states. Senators Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA) are collaborating on an NCLB rewrite dubbed the “Every Child Achieves Act” (ECAA). This bill maintains NCLB’s requirement of administering annual assessments in English and math in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school. But ECAA doesn’t ignore the “opt out” movement – in fact, it adds language that effectively encourages the states to lower the boom on noncompliant students and parents. Under ECAA (as under NCLB), state assessments must “[m]easure the annual progress of not less than 95% of all students . . . .” But while NCLB applies this requirement only to the subset of low-income schools that receive federal Title I funding, ECAA extends the requirement to all schools by making it part of the mandatory state accountability system. If ECAA passes, expect USED to ramp up its threats against states that have too many opt-outs and thus fail in their commitment to ensure 95% participation. During recent debate on ECAA, an amendment was added that nominally protects the right to opt out of assessments: “Nothing in this part shall be construed as preempting a State or local law regarding the decision of a parent or guardian to not have the parent or guardian’s child participate” in the federally mandated assessments. But this language wouldn’t apply unless a state or locality has a law affirmatively protecting the right to opt out, which few do. And while this language could prohibit USED from punishing parents or students who choose to opt out, it would not appear to affect measures taken against states, districts, or schools. If the bill intends to protect the states against retaliatory measures from USED, it should say so. It doesn’t. ECAA also continues to mandate that results of high-stakes assessments be used in state accountability systems. For example, the bill requires states to use assessment scores, progress toward readiness for “college and the workforce,” and high-school graduation rates as a “substantial” portion of a school’s grade. So not only must states ensure 95% participation in the assessments, they must use the results to rate their schools. Is Congress so disconnected from its constituents that it fails to understand the deep-seated objections to these mandatory assessments? Apparently parental complaints have been drowned out by the entreaties of testing giants such as Pearson Education, Educational Testing Service, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and McGraw-Hill, which have protected their lucrative testing turf by spending a combined $20 million on lobbying efforts. The companies get rich and the federal government gets increased control. It will be a win-win for the public/private partnership cronies, while students will lose on every front. Leadership is bull rushing the No Child Left Behind reauthorization bill through. But all has not been lost, at least not yet. We hope people will realize what’s going on and will demand that Congress prohibit the Feds from dictating to the states how often and in what subjects children must be tested. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "My Leftist friends (as well as many ardent #NeverTrumpers) constantly ask me if I’m not bothered by Donald Trump’s lack of decorum. They ask if I don’t think his tweets are “beneath the dignity of the office.” Here’s my answer: We Right-thinking people have tried dignity. There could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than George W. Bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency. We tried statesmanship. Could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized “collegiality” as John McCain? We tried propriety – has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney? And the results were always the same. This is because, while we were playing by the rules of dignity, collegiality and propriety, the Left has been, for the past 60 years, engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob. I don’t find anything “dignified,” “collegial” or “proper” about Barack Obama’s lying about what went down on the streets of Ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the Democratic Party. I don’t see anything “dignified” in lying about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks. I don’t see anything “statesman-like” in weaponizing the IRS to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent. Yes, Obama was “articulate” and “polished” but in no way was he in the least bit “dignified,” “collegial” or “proper.” The Left has been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the Children of the ‘60s. To them, it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale. It has been a war they’ve fought with violence, the threat of violence, demagoguery and lies from day one – the violent take-over of the universities – till today. The problem is that, through these years, the Left has been the only side fighting this war. While the Left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way, the Right has continued to act with dignity, collegiality and propriety. With Donald Trump, this all has come to an end. Donald Trump is America’s first wartime president in the Culture War. During wartime, things like “dignity” and “collegiality” simply aren’t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors. Ulysses Grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the Army for conduct unbecoming. Had Abraham Lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted Grant, the Democrats might well still be holding their slaves today. Lincoln rightly recognized that, “I cannot spare this man. He fights.” General George Patton was a vulgar-talking, son-of-a-bitch. In peacetime, this might have seen him stripped of rank. But, had Franklin Roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum, then Hitler and the Socialists would barely be five decades into their thousand-year Reich. Trump is fighting. And what’s particularly delicious is that, like Patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated Rommel’s, he’s shouting, “You magnificent bastards, I read your book!” That is just the icing on the cake, but it’s wonderful to see that not only is Trump fighting, he’s defeating the Left using their own tactics. That book is Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals – a book so essential to the Liberals’ war against America that it is and was the playbook for the entire Obama administration and the subject of Hillary Clinton’s senior thesis. It is a book of such pure evil, that, just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted, Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer. Trump’s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but, in reality, he is doing exactly what Alinsky suggested his followers do. First, instead of going after “the fake media” – and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong, but diametrically opposed to the truth, from the Tet Offensive to Benghazi, to what really happened on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri – Trump isolated CNN. He made it personal. Then, just as Alinsky suggests, he employs ridicule which Alinsky described as “the most powerful weapon of all.” Everyone gets that it’s not just CNN – in fact, in a world where Al Sharpton and Rachel Maddow, Paul Krugman and Nicholas Kristof are people of influence and whose “reporting” is in no way significantly different than CNN’s – CNN is just a piker. Most importantly, Trump’s tweets have put CNN in an untenable and unwinnable position. With Trump’s ability to go around them, they cannot simply stand pat. They need to respond. This leaves them with only two choices. They can either “go high” (as Hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth) and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can double-down on their usual tactics and hope to defeat Trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguery. The problem for CNN (et al.) with the former is that, if they were to start honestly reporting the news, that would be the end of the Democratic Party they serve. It is nothing but the incessant use of fake news (read: propaganda) that keeps the Left alive. Imagine, for example, if CNN had honestly and accurately reported then-candidate Barack Obama’s close ties to foreign terrorists (Rashid Khalidi), domestic terrorists (William Ayers), the mafia (Tony Rezko) or the true evils of his spiritual mentor, Jeremiah Wright’s, church. Imagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the Obama administration’s weaponizing of the IRS to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the Mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the Obama administration’s cover-up. This makes “going high” a non-starter for CNN. This leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news, conjuring up the next “nothing burger” and devoting 24 hours a day to hysterical rants about how it’s “worse than Nixon.” This, obviously, is what CNN has chosen to do. The problem is that, as they become more and more hysterical, they become more and more obvious. Each new effort at even faker news than before and faker “outrage” only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that Trump is and always has been right about the fake news media. And, by causing their hysteria, Trump has forced them into numerous, highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes. Thus, in their desperation, they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that, even with the liberal (lower case “l”) libel laws protecting the media, they’ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedly. Their flailing at Trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality, with CNN using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an Internet meme. This threat to “dox” – release of personal information to encourage co-ideologists to visit violence upon him and his family -- a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn’t meant just for him. If it were, there would have been no reason for CNN to have made their “deal” with him public. Instead, CNN – playing by “Chicago Rules” – was sending a message to any and all: dissent will not be tolerated. This heavy-handed and hysterical response to a joke on the Internet has backfired on CNN, giving rise to only more righteous ridicule. So, to my friends on the Left – and the #NeverTrumpers as well -- do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be “collegial” and “dignified” and “proper”? Of course I do. These aren’t those times. This is war. And it’s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years. So, say anything you want about this president – I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don’t care. I can’t spare this man. He fights.

        "articles": "With each passing day, President Barack Obama, leftism personified, demonstrates that leftism is characterized by anything other than the human compassion it claims as its exclusive possession. I've always said leftists are about not compassion or treating people with sensitivity and respect, much less equally, but control and bullying, all with an arrogant, mean-spirited air of superiority. For Obama, there are at least two aspects to his control-freakishness. He not only pushes policies that give the federal government vastly more control over our lives but also is inordinately dictatorial in the manner in which he ramrods his agenda through, displaying utter contempt for what anyone else thinks, what he might damage with his unilateral actions and, most of all, the Constitution and the rule of law. Obama is on a tear now, and no one had better get in his way. He told a group of liberal Democratic donors at a fundraiser this week in New York: \"I hope you will all step up because, although I'm very optimistic about our long-term trends, the notion that we would waste two years in further inaction rather than move boldly on a path that I think all of us in this room agree on -- we don't have time to waste. ... The clock is ticking. ... I want to squeeze every last little bit of work that I can during the remainder of my term.\" Prior to his taking office, did anyone ever tell this man no in his life? He acts as though no one else has any say at all in policy decisions in a nation established with three coequal branches of the federal government, individual states with robust powers and citizens armed with individual liberties. It's as if he truly believes that as president, he has the power and a mandate to cram through every last morsel of his leftist wish list, no matter who opposes him or whom he hurts in the process. His latest gambit is to impose federal regulations that could extend overtime pay to as many as 10 million workers who are now ineligible for it. What makes this leftist president think he has a duty to use his office to act like a union boss, micromanaging what management pays employees, irrespective of any of the multitudinous factors that have to be considered in making such a decision? This is part of a disturbing pattern. Obama obviously doesn't care that his onerous regulatory, spending and taxing policies have put a severe and long-term drag on the economy, as long as he gets to use the Monopoly money to spend on pet projects and to redistribute to people he deems, in his sole discretion, to be worthier of it. He is defiantly unconcerned that Obamacare is going to raise people's premiums, as finally admitted by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, despite his promise that it would reduce the premiums for a family of four by some $2,500. He doesn't care that Obamacare is radically reducing the available medical specialists in almost every field throughout the country, that people are losing their plans that he promised they could keep or that it is forcing people out of work. As long as, in his sole discretion, he gets to keep his beloved Obamacare, he will not even consider the collateral damage. In his push to extend unemployment benefits ad infinitum, in his sole discretion, he callously ignored study after study showing that these extensions cost people jobs. He doesn't care that increasing capital gains taxes reduces overall revenues. He doesn't evidence the slightest concern that his unilateral action, in his sole discretion, to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour could cost 500,000 jobs, according to the Congressional Budget Office. He is the president and a wonderful liberal who \"cares\" about the little guy, so don't you dare question him. Trade associations, which are already engaged in fighting him over this minimum wage insanity, say they were blindsided by his announcement to extend overtime pay to workers. \"This came as a shot out of the blue,\" said David French, the National Retail Federation's senior vice president for government relations. \"Just on the surface, this looks like an enormous new administrative burden.\" But Obama can't be concerned with grumbling from the peons. Betsey Stevenson of the White House Council of Economic Advisers said they were trying to \"make the labor force as fair as possible for all workers.\" There they go again. It's all about \"fairness\" and \"economic justice\" and other Jane Fonda-esque euphemisms to disguise their tyrannical actions as caring. Fairness for whom? If employers decide to limit employees' hours or cut their base pay to account for overtime, will that be fair for them? People are rightly concerned that Obama routinely ignores the Constitution and rule of law, but they sometimes overlook just how callous he is in the guise of being compassionate, and it's time he quit getting a pass for his officious behavior.

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster President-elect Joe Biden on Friday chided Republican senators that raised questions about the validity of the 2020 presidential elections based on voting irregularities and allegations of voter fraud. According to Biden, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) repeated President Donald Trump's \"big lie\" about the elections being rigged in favor of Biden. He compared Hawley and Cruz's actions to those of Nazi Germany's Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. “They’re part of the big lie, the big lie. I was being reminded by a friend of mine, and maybe you were with me, I can’t recall, when we told that, you know, [Joseph] Goebbels and the great lie, you keep repeating the law and repeating the lie. Well, there was a print that when Dresden was bombed, firebombed, there were 250 people that were killed — was it 2,500 people that were killed? And Goebbels said 'No, 25,000 — or 250,000 were killed.' And our papers printed that. Our papers printed it. It’s the big lie,\" Biden said during an interview with CBS News. \"It's one thing for one man, one woman, to repeat the lie over and over and over again,\" the president-elect said. Biden tells @NikolenDC that GOP senators who supported election falsehoods, like Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, are \"part of the big lie,\" and references Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels  pic.twitter.com/ukQMDFebHq Cruz took to Twitter to respond to the comparison, saying the divisive rhetoric only further divides the country. Really sad. At a time of deep national division, President-elect Biden’s choice to call his political opponents literal Nazis does nothing to bring us together or promote healing.This kind of vicious partisan rhetoric only tears our country apart.  Hawley slammed Biden's comparison as \"undignified\" and \"immature.\" \"President-elect Biden has just compared me and another Republican Senator to Nazis. You read that correctly. Think about that for a moment. Let it sink in. Because I raised questions in the format prescribed by the laws of the United States about the way elections were conducted in the state of Pennsylvania, just as Democrats did about other states in 2001, 2005, and 2017, he is calling me a Nazi,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"This is undignified, immature, and intemperate behavior from the President-elect.

The Catholic nuns of The Little Sisters of the Poor dedicate their lives to helping the sick and people who are dying. From their website: Last night on The Kelly File, Megyn Kelly took on former NOW President Patricia Ireland over their inclusion of the Little Sisters in their \"Dirty 100\" list. Ireland is the same woman who is clueless about the fact Hobby Lobby offers employees 16 different forms of contraception. Here's a thought for Ms. Ireland, who argues the Little Sisters of the Poor should simply \"opt-out.\" If women want contraception coverage, they have the option of opting out of jobs that do not provide what they are looking for. The bottom line is NOW isn't interested in defending the rights of women, they're interested in defending big government policies. Last time I checked nuns were women too, but for some reason the National Organization for Women isn't interested in defending their right to freedom of religion, but is interested in defining women by the pills they take. It's a shame NOW supports the heavy hand of government forcing women to do things that are against their beliefs. You can read more about NOW and their anti-woman, big government agenda in my new book Assault and Flattery: The Truth About the Left and Their War on Women. Thanks to RightSightings for the video.

        "articles": "For Election 2016, I set deliberate metrics in my mind for supporting Republican Presidential candidates. I wanted to avoid the personal mistakes of Election 2012, whose weak field resulted in a weak frontrunner. I struggled to get behind that candidate, whom I had disparaged as DOA for months. I resolved never to disparage or denigrate candidates so that I could vote for them should my first pick fail.. This year, the bench of contenders is engaging, encouraging, and refreshing. From the outset, I had outlined Scott Walker, then Bobby Jindal for my Top Two: consummate conservative executives who turned their states around, cut the spending, and enacted far-reaching reforms. Tested leadership experience is essential. Commanding a state and protecting citizens commands more respect than directing office staff in the US Senate building. Then Walker walked away. Bad consulting doomed his bid, sources suggested, with excessive spending in multi-state operations. I was holding out for Jindal, who worked the Iowa precincts, and stunned the media and main street with bold pronouncements. Jindal never lost his jingle, but the diminished jangle of campaign donations also forced him to quit. Let’s face it: unless a governor gets national headlines on a constant basis, and contends with talking heads in national media markets, he will struggle to gain traction. So, who occupies Schaper’s second string of Presidential contenders? Mind you, second tier does not means second rate. It’s all about the conservative who is the most electable, and there are a lot of electable conservatives in the GOP field. The next three for me: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, then Carly Fiorina. As of today, I choose Ted Cruz. In a way, Jindal made it easier for me. He was lagging in money and polling, so his electability was non-existent. I was prepared to jump ship. The next day, Jindal dropped out. Besides, I have had a strong affinity for Cruz for a long time. Granted, I detailed his drawbacks compared to Walker: Brilliant and bombastic, his political theatrics have not proved as effective as Tea Party fellow Paul, but he can debate to silent defeat the most ardent of liberals. However, he lacks Walker’s savvy to unity distinct interests within the Republican Party. Presidential candidates must transition from firing up the base to winning over quizzical independents and intrigue disaffected Democrats. Walker worked with colleagues, increased their numbers and influence in Madison. Cruz as political celebrity is magnetic, but does not draw otherwise differing political forces. He remains one of the most hated members of the US Senate. At this point, I want a leader, not a compromiser. If he doesn’t wheel and deal with other US Senators, all the better. Is Cruz incapable of uniting distinct GOP factions? Cruz’ debate performances changed my perception. Democrats watching the CNBC firing squad agreed with Cruz, that the questions were biased, arbitrary, and unfair, and they tweeted their support on The View! I do not agree with the jittery naysayers, who claim that Cruz is too conservative, and cannot win a general election. They said the same thing about Ronald Reagan, and Cruz is better than Barry Goldwater. Besides, the 1964 champion of liberty was running against a Vice President who replaced a popular (conservative) president savagely assassinated. No one in the country was going to switch gears after such tragedy. Cruz is more experienced than most primary partisans realize, too. A former clerk for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, a George W; Bush consultant, and a successful Texas Solicitor General, Cruz won his Senate seat as the outsider against an Establishment pick in a year when Obama’s ground game snuffed out otherwise worthy Republicans across the country. He even stomped on a Democratic challenger with similar legal credentials, all while picking up 40% of the Hispanic vote. A team player with broader vision than one race, he discussed the growing need for Republican outreach to Hispanic communities before his election win. Four years later, US Senator Cruz has shocked the Washington Establishment , as well as the New York money markets and Los Angeles media machines. He talked for twenty-two hours against the funding of Obamacare. I watched it, I loved it, and I wish that it never ended. He has bested the Wall Street-DC phalanx begging for easy bailouts, crony influence, and corporate welfare. Big Government hits a brick wall with Cruz, a supporter of individual liberty, limited government, and constitutional rule. No other candidate has his profile published on free copies of the United States Constitution, a testimony to Cruz’ commitment to the rule of law in our political culture. Further to his credit as a leader, Cruz announced his Presidential bid first, and has stayed strong ever since. With the endorsements of Congressman Steve King of Iowa and my favorite rep Dana Rohrabacher of California, the rising conservative maverick is winning the ground game and top tier support. He can out-debate his colleagues, but has stopped hecklers in their tracks. He shut down a Hollywood mouthpiece Ellen Page at an Iowa state fair. His masterful debate (hardly an interview) with Jorge Ramos inspired so many. In California, moderates and conservatives, former state party chairmen and local county leaders are lining up with Cruz. He has a well-spring of support much wider than the press would care for anyone to believe. His numbers are rising in Iowa, South Carolina, and he is one of the top four in Public Policy Polling. Cruz is developing campaign organizations in otherwise unthinkable locales like Massachusetts, a smooth operator planning for the long haul, taking in support along the way, spending his money wisely for the win. US News and World Report claimed that a Cruz candidacy would be a boon for the Democrats (not likely), and National Review’s Henry Olsen thinks Cruz won’t win, conservatives leery of Donald Trump’s bombast and Carson’s shaky foreign policy credentials are eying the junior US Senator from Texas, and like what they see. For today, I choose Ted Cruz for President.

        "articles": "One year ago, on March 18, 2013, the trial of abortion monster Dr. Kermit Gosnell began in Philadelphia. Two months later Gosnell was convicted on three charges of murder, 21 felony counts of performing illegal late-term abortions, and 211 counts of violating the 24-hour informed consent laws. Gosnell’s convictions really just reflected the tip of the iceberg of what was going on in that clinic. Until inspectors showed up in February 2010 as result of investigation into suspected illegal drug prescription use, Gosnell’s facility operated uninspected for 17 years. According to the Grand Jury report, the last state inspection, before the 2010 raid, had been in 1993. Anecdotes of those who worked there suggest the scope of murder, illegal abortions, abuse of women – mostly low income minority and immigrant women – was far beyond what could be adequately documented to stand up for the trial. The years that Gosnell committed his atrocities with no regulatory oversight, and the challenges to get national media attention to his trial once it began, should provoke extra vigilance today to address the issues involved that still are not getting adequate attention and the extent to which similar abuses are occurring elsewhere. My organization CURE has invited a coalition of leaders from black pro-life organizations and pastors to Washington this week to sit with representatives from national pro-life organizations and with congressional staff to assess where we are and what needs to be done. CARTOONS | Bob Gorrell View Cartoon At the conclusion of the Gosnell trial, the chairmen of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Energy and Commerce committees wrote to Attorneys General and leading health officials in all the states. Attorneys General were asked whether “state and local officials are being stymied in their efforts to protect the civil rights of newborns and their mothers by legal or financial obstacles that are within the federal government’s power to address.” State health officials were asked how they regulate and monitor abortion clinics to protect the health and safety of women. We’d like to know the results of these inquiries and how this information can be used to create better policies for protecting women and children. My colleagues find in their investigations around the nation that Kermit Gosnell was by no means one of a kind. There are more. And, to our dismay, irresponsible and inhumane behavior continues regarding the treatment of women, particularly low-income minority women, in these facilities. The Grand Jury that investigated Kermit Gosnell speculated why he operated so long without getting attention: “We think the reason no one acted is because the women in question were poor and of color, because the victims were infants without identities, and because the subject was the political football of abortion.” This problem persists. We must assure that the crimes that Kermit Gosnell committed are prohibited in federal law because they are incompatible with the most fundamental principles of decency of this country. The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act was signed into law by President Bush in 2002 – after passing in the Democrat controlled Senate unanimously. It outlaws the murder of infants born during late-term abortion procedures.- what Gosnell was doing. But the law is basically symbolic. It is just a warning shot, because it invokes no criminal or civil penalties when violated. Yes, it’s hard to believe that although the federal government recognized, finally, the humanity of every child once it arrives in the world, there is no penalty if that child is not protected from death by murder or intentional neglect. In the memory of the souls of babies killed by Kermit Gosnell and others, and in the name of the decency of this nation, this should be changed. The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act should be revisited and both criminal and civil penalties included for the intentional destruction of any newborn infant.

Yes, it’s hard to believe that although the federal government recognized, finally, the humanity of every child once it arrives in the world, there is no penalty if that child is not protected from death by murder or intentional neglect. In the memory of the souls of babies killed by Kermit Gosnell and others, and in the name of the decency of this nation, this should be changed. The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act should be revisited and both criminal and civil penalties included for the intentional destruction of any newborn infant. But the law is basically symbolic.

        "articles": "The White House and the media were ecstatic about Friday's BLS unemployment report, which showed the national jobless rate dropping to 8.3 percent, as the US economy added 243,000 jobs. These should be welcome results for all Americans, CBO's harrowing 2012 economic projections notwithstanding. Although the headlines were uniformly positive, reality isn't quite as cheery. Leftist Paul Krugman notes that long-term unemployment remains historically persistent, the U-6 \"real\" unemployment rate still floats above 15 percent, and -- most distressingly -- the labor force continues to contract. Zero Hedge documented Friday's flat-out bad news (emphasis his): A month ago, we joked when we said that for Obama to get the unemployment rate to negative by election time, all he has to do is to crush the labor force participation rate to about 55%. Looks like the good folks at the BLS heard us: it appears that the people not in the labor force exploded by an unprecedented record 1.2 million. No, that's not a typo: 1.2 million people dropped out of the labor force in one month! So as the labor force increased from 153.9 million to 154.4 million, the non institutional population increased by 242.3 million meaning, those not in the labor force surged from 86.7 million to 87.9 million. Which means that the civilian labor force tumbled to a fresh 30 year low of 63.7% as the BLS is seriously planning on eliminating nearly half of the available labor pool from the unemployment calculation. The Heritage Foundation confirms the plunge in labor force participation in this chart, followed by another graph demonstrating that by the Obama administration's own projections (which were used to sell the stimulus to anxious Americans in 2009), the unemployment rate should be more than two percentage points lower than today's 8.3 percent: And the failed-on-its-own-terms \"stimulus\" data: Nevertheless, saccharine headlines and \"I get better with age!\" happy talk from President Obama -- matched with a lackluster and increasingly bitter GOP primary -- will give the incumbent an approval boost. Right on cue, the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll purports to show Obama hitting the magic 50 percent mark and leading Mitt Romney in head-to-head general election contest. Celebrate good times, Democrats! Except...the poll is \"worthless,\" according to Hot Air's Ed Morrissey. Why? First, this is a poll of general population adults rather than registered or likely voters, so it’s not even a proper polling type for the predictive outcome they claim. More importantly, though, the poll series has dropped its reporting of partisan identification within their samples. It’s the second time that the poll has not included the D/R/I split in its sample report, and now it looks as though this will be policy from this point forward. Since this is a poll series that has handed double-digit partisan advantages to Democrats in the past (for instance, this poll from April 2011 where the sample only had 22% Republicans), it’s not enough to just hear “trust us” on sample integrity from the Washington Post or ABC. One cannot determine whether Obama’s improvement in this series is a result of the State of the Union speech, as Dan Balz and Jon Cohen suggest, or whether it’s due to shifting the sample to favor Democrats more so than in previous samples. Indeed, WaPo/ABC's numbers have been raked over the coals by conservatives in the past for their ludicrously unbalanced party ID samples. This pollster has displayed an interesting habit of surveying far more Democrats than Republicans, which -- surprise! -- produces favorable data for Democrats. Rather than be held to account for their questionable methods, WaPo/ABC has simply decided to hide their methodology from the public altogether. Which reminds me: I'd like to announce the release of a new nationwide poll of likely voters that shows Barack Obama's approval rating falling to 36 percent. This IGB* survey reveals that Obama would lose to every possible Republican opponent by at least seven points. Whom did this pollster question, you ask? It's IGB's policy to adhere to the Washington Post/ABC News precedent and not release that data. But by all means, please talk about these important findings ad nauseam on television and radio. All sarcasm aside, this election cycle will have peaks and valleys. This latest poll will get breathless attention from liberals, while conservatives will point to Gallup's recent swing-state data and other numbers. Polls are addictive to horse-race watchers (guilty as charged), but they won't become truly meaningful until late September. Recall that McCain-Palin raced out to a ten point lead among likely voters in Gallup on the heels of the 2008 RNC. The rollercoaster ride continues... UPDATE - A Democratic pollster is questioning another element of the WaPo/ABC numbers. *IGB is a new polling firm that exists entirely in this author's mind. Methodology inquiries will be ignored.

        "articles": "As Barack Obama invites in five million illegals to scoop up American jobs, and as those normal Americans lucky enough to still have jobs wait in traffic while morons block the freeway because some Swisher Sweets-puffing felon got himself killed, Hillary Clinton’s chances in 2016 plummet. So it turns out that Obama is likely to achieve one great thing as president – he’ll keep Hillary from ever occupying the Oval Office. It is important to understand that neither the executive amnesty scam nor the bogus outrage over Ferguson actually had anything to with race per se. Obama and his gang are Marxists. This was always about class. The Obama coalition is not the traditional Democrat coalition. It is primarily a class coalition. It is the Democrat Party base and nothing more, made up of rich/academic upper class whites, the unionized government hack sub-class, and lower class welfare recipients. When it won in 2008 and 2012, the coalition added just enough others to push it over the top. But now, those others – primarily middle and working class people employed in the private sector – are fleeing to the GOP. And those were the people Hillary was counting on supply enough votes to win. But if you are a regular person who works for a living, especially if you don’t live on a coast, Obama’s coalition doesn’t want you. In fact, it hates you. You’re a racist, and you’re greedy because you don’t want to give your hard-earned tax money to Democrat-voting deadbeats, and you are oh-so-uncouth that you probably never even listen to NPR. That leaves you just one potential political home, a home where Hillary does not live. I mean the GOP, not the bachelor pad Bill shares with his bimbos. Amnesty was never about Hispanics. It was about creating a permanent poor underclass to be mined for votes. Ferguson wasn’t about the nonexistent phenomena of white cops shooting unarmed black gentle giant college students for no particular reason. It was about keeping core constituents angry while distracting them from the five million job competitors The One just imported. If sacrificing the life of some working stiff flatfoot from flyover country like Darren Wilson was the price, Obama and crew were happy to pay it. Like all those outside the base, he is expendable. While this was great for solidifying the coalition that Obama hopes will keep him a power broker long after he leaves office, it’s an albatross for Hillary. Obama can remain a player with a 35% constituency, but Hillary needs 50% + 1 to win. The Obama coalition/Democrat base has the Chablis-swilling limo libs from Marin County, the AFSCME-dues paying DMV diversity consultants, and the big screen-watching EBT cardholder vote nailed down. Everyone else, not so much anymore. And Obama is clearly fine with that. Hillary was supposed to do what Bill did and bring back those blue collar Dems – the people who make things with their hands, the people who didn’t go to Wellesley, and the government employees like Officer Darren Wilson who actual perform a useful service. But Obama doesn’t need or even want them, and he’s happily driving them away to strengthen his own coalition. He’s refused to stand up against the race hustlers and rioters. And he’s hung the executive amnesty around Hillary’s neck, ensuring that she’ll spend the next two years promising not to undo it – in contrast the GOP nominee who will be talking about little else. Hillary faces two problems that have potentially mutually exclusive solutions. One is keeping the Obama coalition behind her, and it’s already making noises about fleeing to Big Chief Warren. The other is expanding the coalition to once again include normal people. An executive amnesty she could undo with a pen stroke is not going to be any help with that. Nor are media images of businesses burning because some hardworking cop refused to allow himself to be murdered to please the likes of Al Sharpton. Hillary is already making moves to escape the trap Obama – who detests her – has set. It was no coincidence that Hillary’s former fellow New York senator Chuck Schumer got up last week and confessed that Obamacare was an utter disaster for the Democrats. That was the signal – she’s going to try to differentiate herself from President Hope and Change by promising Hope and Change Back to the 1990s. She has to navigate the tightest of tightropes in not alienating the Democrat base, a group that is still the majority of the coalition she’d need to win. That will be hard to do with Obama throwing rotting fruit at her as she tries to walk across the chasm. She’s not up to it. Let’s face it – Hillary is not a skilled politician any more than her daughter is a skilled journalist worth the $600K NBC threw at her. Everything was handed to Hillary. She married into the White House, paid Bill back by backing him when he started interning the interns, and was presented with both a Senate seat and the State Department. Her entire resume reads, “I am Bill Clinton’s nominal wife.” Keep in mind that this is a woman who flunked the District of Columbia bar exam. To do that, you literally have to answer the question, “What is a tort?” by drawing a picture of small cake. A few months ago, it seemed that Hillary was unstoppable. But then we didn’t fully take into account the massive incompetence, narcissism and vindictiveness of Barack Hussein Obama. Perhaps preventing the nightmare of President Hillary Rodham Clinton will be Obama’s greatest – and only – legacy. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "During an appearance on The O'Reilly Factor Monday night, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump was asked by fill-in host Eric Bolling if he regrets writing checks to Hillary Clinton's political campaigns. After first dodging the question, the answer was no (bolding is mine). BOLLING: You've donated to Hillary Clinton in the past and she's been trashing you fairly heavily lately, do you regret donating to her prior campaigns, number one and number two, do you want her to give the money back or donate the money somewhere? TRUMP: They call me a world class businessman. I built a great great company. I filed my papers and everybody's amazed at how big, how strong, how good it is, how little debt, the cash flow, the quality of the assets, iconic assets and this is what our country needs, they need this thinking. But as a business man that deals all over the world, you give. I mean this is very standard. You help people from Republicans to Democrats and I think it's very well accepted even within the Republican Party, that's why I'm leading by so much. BOLLING: Do you regret donating to her campaign, though? TRUMP: I don't regret it, it's the way it is. When I was a businessman you get to everybody, you're friends with everybody, you get along with everybody and that's the way it is and when you're running for office and not in the world of business and you don't have to go all over the world and you don't need recommendations and other things it's different but when you're a businessman you give to everybody and keep everybody happy, everybody loves them. Maybe it's a good system and maybe it's not a good system but it's the system in which I was under and I thrived. Trump donated thousands of dollars multiple times to Hillary Clinton's New York Senate race and 2008 presidential campaign.

        "articles": "They hate you. Leftists don’t merely disagree with you. They don’t merely feel you are misguided. They don’t think you are merely wrong. They hate you. They want you enslaved and obedient, if not dead. Once you get that, everything that is happening now will make sense. And you will understand what you need to be ready to do. You are normal, and therefore a heretic. You refuse to bow to their idols, to subscribe to their twisted catechisms, to praise their false gods. This is unforgivable. You must burn. Crazy talk? Just ask them. Go ahead. Go on social media. Find a leftist – it’s easy. Just say something positive about America or Jesus and they’ll come swarming like locusts. Engage them and very quickly they will drop their masks and tell you what they really think. I know. I keep a rapidly expanding file of Twitter leftist death wish screenshots. They will tell you that Christians are idiots and vets are scum. That normals are subhumans whose role is to labor as serfs to subsidize the progressive elite and its clients. That you should die to make way for the New Progressive Man/Woman/Other. Understand that when they call Donald Trump “illegitimate,” what they are really saying is that our desire to govern ourselves is illegitimate. Their beef isn’t with him – it’s with us, the normal people who dared rise up and demand their right to participate in the rule of this country and this culture. They hate you, because by defying them you have prevented them from living up to the dictates of their false religion. Our rebelliousness has denied them the state of grace they seek, exercising their divine right to dictate every aspect of our puny lives. Their sick faith gives meaning to these secular weirdos, giving them something that fills their empty lives with a messianic fervor to go out and conquer and convert the heathens. And the heathens are us. Oh, there are different leftist sects. There are the social justice warriors who have manufactured a bizarre mythology and scripture of oppression, privilege, and intersectionality. Instead of robes, they dress up as genitals and kill babies as a blasphemous sacrament. Then there are the pagan weather religion oddballs convinced that the end is near and that we must repent by turning in our SUVs. Of course, the “we” is really “us” – high priests of the global warming cult like Leonardo DiCaprio will still jet around the world with supermodels while we do the ritual sacrificing of our modern comforts. Then there are the ones who simply worship themselves, the elitists who believe that all wisdom and morality has been invested in them merely because they went to the right college, think the right thoughts, and sneer at anyone living between I-5 and I-95. But all the leftist sects agree – they have found the revealed truth, and imposing it upon the benighted normals like us is so transcendently important that they are relieved of any moral limitations. They are ISIS, except with hashtags instead of AKs, committed to the establishment of a leftist caliphate. You wonder why the left is now justifying violence? Because they think that helps them right now. Today it’s suddenly OK to punch a “Nazi.” But the punchline is that anyone who opposes them is a “Nazi.” You wonder why they ignore the rule of law, why they could switch on a dime from screaming at Trump for refusing to preemptively legitimize a Hillary win and then scream that he is illegitimate the moment she lost? Because their only principle is what helps the left win today. That’s why the media gleefully, happily lies every single day about every single thing it reports. Objectivity? When that stopped being a useful thing, it stopped being a thing at all. They are fanatics, and by not surrendering, by not kneeling, and by not obeying, you have committed an unpardonable sin. You have defied the Left, and you must be broken. They will take your job, slander your name, even beat or kill you – whatever it takes to break you and terrify others by making you an example. Your defiance cannot stand; they cannot allow this whole Trump/GOP majority thing to get out of control. They must crush this rebellion of the normal, and absolutely nothing is off the table. We’ve seen them burn UC Berkeley and how the police controlled by the leftist state government of California stood by and watched as Americans were beaten by the mob. Why? Because the government of the State of California approves of the violence. Do you think it’s a coincidence that California is doing everything it can to disarm its normals? The Left won’t say it out loud – at least not yet – but make no mistake. If violence is what it takes for the Left to prevail, then violence we will have. You saw it, and you were meant to. Berkeley was a message about the price of dissent where leftist hold sway. And they seek to hold sway everywhere How to we respond? The first step is to end the denial. Open your eyes. See what is happening. Don’t allow yourself to be deluded by false nostalgia for a past period of cultural peace that existed only because, at that time, the Left was winning. They hate you. Look at Twitter. Look at Facebook. Try and tell yourself that leftists are just nice people who disagree with you on a few policy details. Stop fooling yourself. Understand that this must get much worse before it can get better. We may wish to stop the cultural/political struggle, but they can’t stop. Their religion tells them we are greedy, racist, sexist, homophobe morons who hate science and love Hitler. How could they tolerate us? How could they ever allow us power? They can’t. Their sick ideology and false theology requires that we be enslaved or exterminated – we can’t be tolerated, and we certainly can’t be allowed to hold the reins of power. I hoped that my novel People’s Republic, about what lies at the bottom of this blood-soaked slippery slope, would be rendered moot by the GOP’s victory in November. I was wrong. The Left has redoubled its efforts. So the only outcome is that one side wins and the other loses. There’s no truce to be had, no possibility of a tie. And the frightening thing is that the Left is so foolish, so stuck in its bubble that it has no understanding that it can only push so far before the people with all the guns and all the training push back. That’s the problem with kids who were raised on participation trophies and who never got into a fistfight – they don’t consider the possibility that they will lose, and lose hard. We must ensure they do. Understand your enemy. Understand that the Left will exploit your principles and morals to make you disarm yourself – figuratively and literally. Don’t play their game; don’t fall for their manufactured outrages. Never concede their lies, never take their side against the people defending your liberty. Most of all, accept the truth that if we let them win we will spend the rest of our lives on our backs with a giant Birkenstock pressed into our collective face. They hate us. And however they come at us, we need to be prepared to fight. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "For years, we have been hearing that the Republican Party was on the ropes: when Bill Clinton won in 1992 and 1996; when Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012; when the tea party launched in 2009; when Texas Senator Ted Cruz and company shut down the federal government for a few days in 2013. (Remember when we were told that voters were going to \"punish\" Republicans in 2014? Yeah, that was right before they handed the GOP control of the House and Senate.) When Donald Trump roared into the primaries in 2015 and knocked out his more -- shall we say -- traditional GOP rivals one by one, and even (perhaps especially) since Donald Trump's election, the media's go-to narrative has been how the Republican Party is fragmented and crumbling. Now we know that it's the Democratic Party that's rotting from within. This isn't about the staggering loss of seats in state governments. It's about the sex scandals that have enveloped Hollywood -- and now the media and Washington. What's even more shocking than the reprehensible conduct itself is how intimately entwined these scandals are with the Democratic Party's politics, its operatives and their tactics. Let's start with Harvey Weinstein. One of the biggest Hollywood fundraisers for Democrats, he has become the poster boy for the most egregious sexual harassment and assault. As journalist Ronan Farrow has exposed, Weinstein's modus operandi included hiring high-powered attorneys like David Boies of Boies Schiller Flexner. Boies' law firm paid Black Cube -- an intelligence-gathering company Weinstein employed -- to dig up dirt on and silence potential accusers. According to Ronan Farrow, K2 -- another intelligence firm -- was hired by Elkin Abramowitz, also one of Weinstein's defense attorneys. K2's job was to ensure that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. -- a Democrat -- did not prosecute Weinstein after sexual assault charges were filed against him in New York. Vance was once employed by Abramowitz' firm, and has since drawn criticism for taking campaign contributions from lawyers \"having dealings with his office.\" Weinstein's attorneys also had his victims sign iron-clad nondisclosure agreements that effectively covered up his behavior. As I wrote last week, David Boies' name appears with some frequency in these accounts. PBS and CBS host Charlie Rose was fired this past week after eight women came forward with sordid stories of sexual harassment and abuse of power. Lo and behold, who has turned up as one of Rose's former attorneys? None other than David Boies. New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush has also been suspended following accusations of sexual misconduct involving younger women at the Times and Politico. Remember Glenn Thrush? His was one of many emails released by Wikileaks that demonstrated how far in the tank the media was for 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Thrush sent a potentially negative story to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta for approval before publishing. Thrush's email read, in part, \"Because I have become a hack I will send u the whole section that pertains to u (sic). Please don't share or tell anyone I did this.\" The Wikileaks email dump also exposed that Donna Brazile -- at the time, a contributing political correspondent at CNN -- was feeding debate questions to Clinton in advance of the event. Brazile lost her position at CNN, and has now written a best-seller, \"Hacks,\" in which she gives her take on why Clinton lost the election. Among her revelations: that the DNC was financially controlled and manipulated by the Clintons, to the political detriment of the other (and arguably more popular) Democratic candidate, Bernie Sanders. Brazile stepped in as DNC chair after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned in disgrace, only to be scooped by Clinton and named \"honorary\" campaign chair. Wasserman Schultz's handsomely paid former IT staffer Imran Awan has since been indicted, and is suspected of selling sensitive data to Pakistanis and Russians. Charles Manson's recent death brought disturbing reminders that even the Democratic Party's golden boy, Barack Obama, has unsavory alliances in his background. After the grisly murders of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six others in July of 1969, Weather Underground founder Bernardine Dohrn said, \"Offing those rich pigs with their own forks and knives, and then eating a meal in the same room. Far out! The Weathermen dig Charles Manson.\" Manson and his followers were murderous lunatics. Bernardine Dohrn (along with her husband Bill Ayers) was a communist revolutionary and domestic terrorist responsible for multiple bombings. Dohrn expressed admiration for the Manson murders. And Barack Obama launched his political career in her living room. The Democratic Party -- at least at the level of national leadership -- is riddled through and through with questionable affiliations, political scandals, sexual deviants and interconnected teams of lawyers and paid spies protecting them. It's time for the Democrats to clean house. New leadership needs to come from the grass roots -- mayors, city council and school board members -- fresh faces and people who step up from every walk of life to cleanse their party of the rot that has corrupted it for the past 40-plus years. No more Clintons, Podestas, Obamas, media shills, communist agitators or community organizers. The Democratic Party is dead. Long live the Democratic Party.

Conversation beats censorship. Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been in relative obscurity since the loss of his MSNBC program, vaulted back into this three-ring political circus recently when he suggested to Charlie Rose that federal subsidies for the Thomas Jefferson Memorial should end, because Jefferson owned slaves. People like Sharpton fan the flames they claim need extinguishing. Some even start the fires, like those characters from a bad B-movie who confronted each other in Charlottesville, Virginia, causing death and destruction, not only to individuals and property, but to the links that have traditionally held us together as a nation, in spite of our differences. As usual, the media have contributed to the cultural fracturing by elevating tiny groups of bigots and leftists to center stage. Drivers slow down and pay attention to car wrecks and cultural collisions. Part of this chaos comes from government's inability, or unwillingness, to solve, or even address, major challenges. We aren't winning wars in Afghanistan, or against ISIS, which has taken credit for the vehicle attack in Barcelona that killed 14 people and wounded scores more. We aren't winning battles over health care, or taxes, or much else in Washington, where gridlocked rush-hour traffic could serve as a metaphor for a gridlocked Congress. President Trump promised during the campaign he would win so much the rest of us would grow tired of winning. We have yet to reach anything approaching exhaustion. There is an effort by some on the left, not just to rewrite history, which would be bad enough, but to expunge it, as happens in totalitarian states. George Orwell foresaw the danger in such an approach when he created the \"memory hole\" in his classic novel, \"1984.\" For those who never read the book, the memory hole was for destroying all historical documents that could remind, or inform, citizens of the way things were in a time before they were born. History would then be rewritten to match the evolving propaganda of the state. An agency with the euphemistic name \"The Ministry of Truth\" handled such things. A similar effort to delete history was the Nazi's public book burning in Berlin in 1933. The focus on statues by people whose education level likely wouldn't pass the \"Jeopardy\" test is a distraction designed to keep our minds on things other than solving real problems and to pit us against each other for the cultural, political and fundraising benefit and goals of various groups on the left and right. I like what former NBA star and current sports commentator Charles Barkley said about the removal of Confederate statues: \"I'm not going to waste my time worrying about these Confederate statues -- that's wasted energy. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna keep doing great things. I'm gonna keep trying to make a difference -- number one, in the black community because I'm black -- but I'm also going to try to do good things in the world.\" Barkley has the right attitude and if more of us followed his example we might actually achieve something of value for ourselves and the nation. Future generations would then find a history worth studying and emulating.

        "articles": "Paul Ryan should walk around Congress for the next couple of weeks wearing a sign around his neck that reads, “I am a failure.” It’s not that everyone else doesn’t already know that he’s a failure – oh, that’s one message that he’s succeeded in getting out Lima Charlie – it’s that it doesn’t seem like he knows that he’s a failure. Perhaps some signage would remind him to wipe that smug, smarmy grin off his face, and inspire him to achieve something other than nothing. Yet he’ll persist, with his unerring poor judgment, his undercurrent of condescension to anyone not in tune with his wonky nonsense, and his inability to master the most basic competencies of his job, in proving himself a worthy successor to John Boehner as the GOP’s biggest obstacle to victory. It’s certainly not the Democrats – those hacks spent the night of the healthcare retreat taking mass selfies celebrating Ryan’s hopelessness and convincing themselves that his running into the GOP’s own end zone was their score. It wasn’t – notwithstanding Paul’s unforced error, they are the Falcons at the Super Bowl with a halftime show featuring Nickelback. See, the big news this week isn’t the first quarter Obamacare repeal festival of ineptitude – it’s that Neil Gorsuch is going to sail through to confirmation, leaving the burning wreckage of the SCOTUS filibuster in his wake. That’s the money right there, a win guaranteeing that the future confirmation of RBG’s replacement – who I hope is so conservative he eats raw meat off the bone – will be just a mere 51-vote technicality. And there’s other stuff too: laying the Keystone pipe, rolling back regulations, ICE booting out aspiring Democrats, and Trump wrangling new jobs. Even the fact that Team Trump was wiretapped was reaffirmed despite the NYT denying that when it reported that Team Trump was wiretapped it really meant that Team Trump was wiretapped. Slowly but surely, small win after small win – we’re moving toward victory. But thanks to kongressional klutzes like Ryan, a war of attrition is how it’s going to have to be. Ulysses S. Grant also knew something about pummeling the stubborn Democrats of #TheResistance into submission, although his Democrats used iron chains instead of welfare and lies to keep their serfs in bondage. Grant wasn’t a big, flamboyant martial artist like George Patton – he didn’t make giant, bold strokes across the canvas of the battlefield. Grant was about brute force, not finesse. He found his Democrat enemy, fixed him in position, and beat on him until the Democrat couldn’t take it anymore and handed over his saber. That’s the right strategy for facing this intractable foe – luckily, the Democrats of today are merely a bunch of talky, whiny wusses, not the hardcore and courageous infantry and cavalry G-Dawg (and my ancestors) were called upon to regulate. Grant had bad days too. Just ask the guys at The Crater. You don’t always win, even when you are exhausted from all your prior #winning. The enemy was delighted at the repeal screw-up: ABC News broke in with a special report, libgasmic at Ryan pulling the hapless bill, while the circle of smart over at CNN was breaking out the cuddles and cigs, certain that this was finally the beginning of the end of Trump. Nope. It’s still the beginning of the beginning. We’re are about 67 days in out of 1461, just 4.29% done, and the haters’ attempts to pronounce the Trump administration DOA are wishful unthinking. Of course, this is all now just a cliché – “Oh, Trump’s done for this time!” has been the “Oh, well I never!” of the Democrat and Fredocon Margaret Dumont Coalition since they figured out that he actually intends to do what he promised to do. Grant had to deal with his share of failed commanders – Grant jebcanned Ambrose Burnside after the fiasco at The Crater. But Ryan is the head of half of a co-equal branch – he can’t just be cashiered, as much as everyone would like him to be. With no apparent generally acceptable replacement on the horizon, conservatives are stuck with a weakened, chastened P90X Paul. Maybe now, instead of blasting his own glutes (and ours), Ryan will start understanding that he needs to kick the glutes of our enemies. But then establishmentocons have shown zero capacity to learn from their myriad failures. Remember, these RINOs are the George McClellans of conservatism – always waiting waiting waiting for the “right time” that never comes to actually do battle with progressivism, and thereby letting it run rampant, pillaging the countryside. We know the strategy – grind out win after win, big and small, over time until the liberals are broken. It’s the tactics that Ryan has botched; he’s shown no aptitude for the basic blocking and tackling of legislating and consistently falls back on the errors of the past. Here’s how healthcare should have gone. Paully, starting the morning of November 9th, you should have orchestrated an inclusive effort to create a bill based on a consensus that incorporated every stakeholder with the ability to icepick it (the transition team, the Freedom Caucus, the squishes, the think tanks, and most vitally, the Senate). Once you had something everyone agreed on – and 216 sure votes in the House and 51 in the Senate – you all appear with the Prez in front of the cameras to announce it before you actually put out the document, thereby cementing in the narrative about why the people should dig it before the haters can hate it into little pieces. Then you pass it and win. But what did we get? A tactical clusterflunk. Seven years in and Ryan wasn’t ready. He putzed around with no sense of urgency until there was a sense of urgency. Who was expecting this dog’s breakfast to drop when it did? And it just dropped on us out of the blue – one day, suddenly, there’s this whole plan out there. Surprise! I listened to Hugh Hewitt the morning after it was released; he was stunned that he couldn’t get any of the Republican House leadership [sic] on his show to talk to his conservative audience about the biggest piece of legislation in Trump’s first term. Paully, you gave the enemy precious hours to set the narrative, and the bill never recovered. How stupid can you be to have no full court press plan to sell it, to manage the message, even though my corgi-retriever could have foreseen the media’s narrative was going to be that this was the moral equivalent of the Rwandan genocide - only without all the love? Three phases? You didn’t have the credibility for one phase and you were babbling about three. Any idiot could have seen that Phase III (“The Democrats Do Exactly the Opposite of What Democrats Do”) was never going to happen. Well, apparently not every idiot. If you had incorporated all the people you needed in the drafting, they might have alerted you that this was New Coke dumb. But you and your cronies drafted it in secret in some dark room somewhere with no input from the people who actually had to go explain their vote to their voters. “Surprise! Here’s a steaming pile of garbage! Please vote for it because I want you to!” Yeah, no. Congrats! That’s how you manage to garner a 17% approval rating for a plan to repeal something that is about as popular as herpes. Luckily, most people aren’t #caring about #RepealFail like us political junkies. Within 12 hours, Twitter forgot about the fiasco and was back to trending topics of the #DeformAMovieWithOneLetter sort (“Star Warts”), though enough people were sufficiently freaked out to make it a good sale day for my novel about America splitting into red and blue halves. Ryan is still making tactical errors. Instead of saying, “Tomorrow, I am calling together all the stakeholders and we are getting right back to work on fixing this,” it was, “Well, that was sad. Let’s forget about repealing Obamacare for a while and work on tax reform because it’s important to let the media spin us as focusing all our efforts on giving tax cuts to the rich instead of cutting normal people’s premiums.” And you just know Wonky O’Tonedeaf is going to wheel out a tax reform abortion cobbled together in some Cannon Office Building utility closet that screws over Republican voters with cuts to the home mortgage, charity, and state tax deductions because why wouldn’t the GOP be stupid enough to shaft its own voters while still managing to get painted by the media as toadying to the rich? Obamacare’s getting repealed, just not today. Nor next month apparently, since the 438 members of the House can’t seem to do more than one thing at once. Of course, if Ryan didn’t have them working just eight days in April – yeah, you heard me right – maybe they could accomplish something besides managing to look both inept and lazy while currying favor with the zillionaires. You might as well wear top hats and monocles because you seem hellbent on validating every hack cliché about Republicans. The Grant strategy is the only strategy that’s going to work against this stubborn, entrenched enemy. Grind it out, an inch at a time, until the enemy breaks. And luckily, Grant was able to win his war using this strategy even with tactically inept generals. Yet Paul Ryan, with his utter inability to competently manage legislation and, worse, with his total refusal to learn from his constant series of errors, is a real problem because Trump just can’t fire him. But the GOP caucus can, and they need to send him a message Lima Charlie. Learn or leave, Paully, because if you can’t kick some Democrat asset, you’re nothing but a liability. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Three truths fuel Donald Trump. One, Barack Obama is the Dr. Frankenstein of the supposed Trump monster. If a charismatic, Ivy League-educated, landmark president who entered office with unprecedented goodwill and both houses of Congress on his side could manage to wreck the Democratic Party while turning off 52 percent of the country, then many voters feel that a billionaire New York dealmaker could hardly do worse. If Obama had ruled from the center, dealt with the debt, addressed radical Islamic terrorism, dropped the politically correct euphemisms, and pushed tax and entitlement reform rather than Obamacare, Trump might have little traction. A boring Hillary Clinton and a staid Jeb Bush would likely be replaying the 1992 election between Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush -- with Trump as a watered-down version of third-party outsider Ross Perot. But America is in much worse shape than in 1992. And Obama has proved a far more divisive and incompetent president than George H.W. Bush. Little is more loathed by a majority of Americans than sanctimonious PC gobbledygook and its disciples in the media. And Trump claims to be PC's symbolic antithesis. Making Machiavellian Mexico pay for a border fence or ejecting rude and interrupting Univision anchor Jorge Ramos from a press conference is no more absurd than allowing more than 300 sanctuary cities to ignore federal law by sheltering undocumented immigrants. Is it sober and judicious of the Obama administration to ignore immigration laws and effectively open the southern border wide to all comers? Putting a hold on the immigration of Middle Eastern refugees is no more illiberal than welcoming into American communities tens of thousands of unvetted foreign nationals from terrorist-ridden Syria. Would the Obama administration allow a mass entrance of persecuted Middle East Christians or displaced Ukrainians? In terms of messaging, is Trump's crude bombast any more radical than Obama's teleprompted scripts? Trump's ridiculous view of Russian President Vladimir Putin as a sort of \"Art of the Deal\" geostrategic partner is no more silly than Obama insulting Putin as Russia gobbles up former Soviet republics with impunity. Trump's confusions are reminiscent of Obama's own, though Trump knows how to pronounce the word \"corpsman,\" and that there are not 57 states. Obama callously dubbed his own grandmother a \"typical white person,\" introduced the nation to the racist and anti-Semitic rantings of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, and petulantly wrote off small-town Pennsylvanians as near-Neanderthal \"clingers.\" Did Obama lower the bar for Trump's disparagements? Certainly, Obama peddled a slogan, \"hope and change,\" that was as empty as Trump's \"make America great again.\" Two, the Republican establishment also jolted Trump to life. Trump supporters apparently don't believe that Chamber of Commerce, Wall Street or Republican Party grandees offer many antidotes to Obamism. Republicans who play by the Marquess of Queensberry rules don't seem to have the belly to deal with the $10 trillion in additional debt accumulated during the Obama administration; out-of-control entitlement spending; chaos in the Middle East; the empowerment of the Islamic State, Iran, Russia and China; the deterioration of racial relations; and political correctness gone wild. Three, Trump is a nihilist, but he is a canny nihilist unlike any we have seen in recent campaigns. In about a day, Trump wrecked Hillary Clinton's planned \"war on women\" talking points that had helped to win the election for Obama in 2012. Given the modern-day recognition of microaggressions and the implosion of onetime national icon Bill Cosby, a front-line feminist warrior like Mrs. Clinton cannot get away with enabling her husband Bill Clinton, a philanderer and accused sexual harasser. \"If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong,\" Trump declared recently. Street fighter Trump has an uncanny ability to spot these apparent contradictions. Jeb Bush is a good person who really was \"low-energy.\" Trump's unkind label stuck. Politicians really do pander in shameless fashion to big-money donors. Who better than Trump to know that? He claims he used to lavish cash on lots of them. Trump does not play by any political rules because he has always made up or bought his own rules. Such a wheeler-dealer is no more bothered by an anchorman's raised brow than he was by a banker's frown. How does the establishment derail an out-of-control train for whom there are no gaffes, who has no fear of the New York Times, who offers no apologies for speaking what much of the country thinks -- and who apparently needs neither money from Republicans nor politically correct approval from Democrats? .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "With a population of just over half a million and an unemployment rate of 3%, politics plays out differently in North Dakota. Issues that don’t resonate with voters on a national stage, like the failure of the House to pass a Farm Bill, are of primary concern to North Dakota voters. Although solidly Republican when it comes to voting for a president, they have had a Democratic Senator for over fifty years. For this reason, the Senate race between current Representative Rick Berg (R) and former Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp (D) has shaped up to be a hotly contested race for control of the Senate with national groups on both sides pumping millions of dollars to prop up their side and run ads attacking the other. Old-fashioned retail politics might be more effective, though. In a small state like North Dakota, personalities tend to be more important than they might be elsewhere. Heitkamp has tried to downplay her support of President Obama and his how nice she is. One supporter embodied the attitude perfectly when he said, “I don’t necessarily agree with her, but I trust her.” Speaking to the New York Times, Berg explained what he would rather focus on: “Everyone’s pretty likable. The issue is not about a personality contest. This whole thing kind of boils down to, do you want someone who’s going to fight against President Obama.” Berg has been trying to pivot to national issues and how North Dakota should be a lesson for the rest of the United States. New polling data released Friday shows that the race is still very much up in the air. It shows Heitkamp up 4% with a margin of error of 4% and 8% of people undecided. This means the candidates are virtually tied with a sizeable portion still waiting to be swayed. But, as Berg was quick to point out, this poll was funded by the Democratic Party and the company that conducted it (Stone Research Services) was the same one that showed Obama winning the state in 2008 by 8 points. It’s hardly the most trustworthy data. Still, with just over a month to go, the solidly Republican state’s open U.S. Senate seat is anyone’s game.

        "articles": "The Obama Administration’s call for greater taxes and “shared sacrifice” is hollow and morally bankrupt. President Obama wants to convince the nation that many Americans, most of them small business owners, must pay more tax as “their fair share” of huge, annual deficits. What Mr. Obama never mentions is that he has surrounded himself with key advisors and selected key members of his Administration that are tax cheats. Never before has an Administration been so wholly composed of senior officials that push so stridently for increasing taxes on Americans, while they avoid any personal responsibility for paying their own personal taxes. Seemingly, if you are a member of the Obama Administration, your “fair share” of the national tax burden is zero. Instead, taxes are an instrument of “shared sacrifice” to be loaded onto someone else. First some numbers. Some 41 different Senior Obama Administration Officials have been identified as tax cheats, owing over $840 million in back taxes. Many of Obama’s key officials that are responsible for the economy and have been given wide powers in tax policy are themselves, tax cheats and tax avoiders. The most notable of these is Timmy Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury and nominal head of the IRS, who utilized the “INTUIT TurboTax-is-not intuitive-I didn’t-realize-I was-supposed-to-pay-taxes” defense. Once exposed, Obama dismissed Geithner’s tax cheating, and had no problem with him heading the Treasury/IRS. In fact, Mr. Obama continued to stock his Administration with tax cheats and tax avoiders, seeing no contradiction in a advocating policies that call for ever greater taxes on other Americans, while so many of his own cabinet and key economic advisors have failed to pay. Hilda Solis, Secretary of Labor, used the “I’m-just-a-wife-how-can-I-be-held-responsible-for-knowing-what-my-husband-is-doing” defense, and after paying back taxes on the few years for which they were fingered, now heads the team shaping Obama’s labor taxes policies. Ron Kirk, Obama’s Trade representative, had tax problems, as did Kathleen Sibelius, current HHS Secretary, who leads the push for the Obamacare atrocity, and unabashedly calls for greater taxes and burdens on honest Americans to fund the dodgy scheme. There are also tax problems with the appointees at levels below the cabinet, such as Capricia Marshall (Chief of Protocol), with the “post-office-ate-my-tax return” defense or Lael Brainerd (Treasury Undersecretary). In addition to the individual tax cheats currently serving in the Obama administration, there have been a startling number of nominees who have withdrawn their nomination after being publicly exposed as having tax and other issues. A quick review includes Tom Daschle (HHS Nominee), Nancy Killefer (OMB nominee), Bill Richardson, and Caroline Atkinson (Treasury-International Affairs), just to name a few. Some of the Obama appointees’ tax problems may not have been as despicable as others, but just look at the number of them. Has any previous Administration been so infested with tax cheats? Nor does President Obama seem to think tax cheating and tax avoidance are detriments to public service for he continues to select nominees that are similarly “tax challenged”. Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric was selected by Obama to lead his Counsel on Jobs and Competitiveness this past January. Immelt has boasted of GE’s staggering $14.2 billion in profits and that it paid no taxes. Yet, Immelt feels right at home pushing the Obama line that other Americans need to pay more in taxes to fund the bloated government that Obama has added. The Obama Administration seems to be filled with so many tax cheats and tax avoiders that it has surrendered any credibility on the issue of increasing taxes. President Obama remains undeterred by the poor example set by his own Administration and brazenly announced that “we are beginning to crack down on Americans who are bending or breaking the rules, and we're helping to ensure that all Americans are contributing their fair share—and not let some citizens and businesses dodge their tax responsibility, while ordinary Americans pick up the slack.” Fine words, but what the President did not mention is that his Administration sets a terrible example and is most in need of a “crack down”. Indeed, recent reports estimate the full amount of taxes owed by all members of the Obama Administration is over $3 billion. Americans are saddled with the sad example of a President that seems to feel no reluctance in calling on others to pay more taxes, even as his own Administration is increasingly composed of tax cheats. Nor is the President deterred in the use of increasingly hostile rhetoric used to describe honest opponents (most of whom do pay their annual taxes), questioning their patriotism, fairness, and compassion. Obama’s tax policy seems aimed at protecting his own loyalists and pushing responsibility for taxes onto others. One thing is clear: Obama can always count on folks who don’t pay their taxes to support higher taxes for others because it sure seems they know they won’t have to pay. If Obama wants to restore his credibility in the debate on taxes, he should first get rid of the many close advisors that have cheated on their taxes, and require all those serving in his Administration to pay what they owe. Until he does so, the strange and tortured logic that President Obama uses to push for other Americans to pay “their fair share” must be rejected. Put simply, the Obama Administration has no credibility to talk about tax policy, much less make any moral argument about who should be paying more. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "The war over Judge Merrick Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court by President Obama is nowhere near over, though coverage might fade whenever Donald Trump holds a rally, which some have aptly noted is covered like the moon landings in the news media. Regardless, prior to the St. Patrick’s Day festivities, NBC’s Savannah Guthrie actually pressed White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough on the Obama administration’s position that the Senate should do its job and consider the Garland nomination. She noted that then-Sen. Obama voted against the nomination of now Chief Justice John Roberts and was part of the filibuster of Associate Justice Samuel Alito (via NewsBusters): DENIS MCDONOUGH: Well, what’s interesting, Savannah, is in both of those cases not only did senators meet with and give a hearing to those candidates, but in fact, they voted on them. And that’s exactly the process that we’re asking for here. GUTHRIE: But, Denis, President Obama voted to filibuster Justice Alito, which is another way of saying not bring him to the Senate floor for a full vote. MCDONOUGH: Well, in fact, what they did have is a series of hearings and then they had a vote out of committee, then they had a debate on the Senate floor. That filibuster was stopped and he was voted on to the court. That's exactly the way – GUTHRIE: So he doesn’t regret being part of that? MCDONOUGH: That’s exactly the way the process should work, Savannah. That’s exactly what we hope will happen in this case. That’s exactly what the President called for yesterday. And we have a candidate here who has – is uniformly recognized, again, in the papers this morning and all day yesterday, somebody with unquestionable excellence and terrific experience. MATT LAUER: Real, real, quickly if you can, Denis, does the President have one firm ally on the Republican side in the Senate that he feels will help him get this to a hearing and confirmation? MCDONOUGH: Well, we feel really good about the first day of this out of the announcement yesterday. We heard many, more than a handful of Republicans now changing their position and being willing to meet with Judge Garland – LAUER: But does the President have a real firm ally on the Republican side? MCDONOUGH: Again, what I said is that yesterday we heard several, more than a handful of Republican senators agreeing to meet with him. We think that’s a good start. But this is not rocket science, here, Matt. All they need to do is do what the Constitution says, give him a hearing, give him a vote, and let's fill that vacancy. GUTHRIE: Alright, chief of staff Denis McDonough, thanks for getting up early with us. We appreciate it. LAUER: Thanks, Denis. You have to give credit where credit is due–and Guthrie deserves some credit for pressing McDonough on the president’s past behavior with Bush nominees to the Supreme Court. Obama’s conduct in that regard, along with his fellow Democratic colleagues in the Senate, undercuts their position that the Senate has to act (they don’t) on the Garland nomination. It’s to the point where their counter-talking points are hilariously grounded in disregarding what they said years ago on judicial nominations during election years. That’s not how this works. There is a public record, we know what you said, and it appears to be positions that are diametrically opposed to the ones you are holding now, Senate Democrats. That’s called hypocrisy. Moreover, the Senate doesn’t “have to give” Garland a hearing or a vote. They simply don’t. That’s not in the Constitution. Is this political posturing? Yes. Has it always been this way on both sides dating back the days of the early Republic? Yes. But Republicans aren’t the ones who are throwing a tantrum, saying forget what I said in the past because it doesn’t help our narrative in this Supreme Court fight. Also, while Guthrie did well, let us not forget her abhorrent question to South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley after the tragic Charleston shooting last June, where she asked if this event means it’s time to rethink the Second Amendment.

        "articles": "It’s becoming pretty clear that, like their Democrat forefathers, today’s Democrats are convinced that America is entirely too free and that they must take their blue states and secede. We normals no longer meet their high moral standards, what with our insistence on believing in God, having a voice in our governance, and our primitive desire not to have men lurking in women’s restrooms. Plus guns. Fine. Let them go. Good riddance. We’ll be able to pray and have our voices heard by government even as we continue to embrace anti-#Science concepts like chromosomes determining your sex. Plus guns. You liberals should take your blue state coastal enclaves and become the United States of Sweden. Just remember that you will have made your Ikea futon and you’ll have to sleep in it. Here are 11 principles to embrace as we move forward after the blue states leave us. 1. We must re-ratify the Constitution, only this time we need to actually mean it. Our Constitution needs to say what it says and not what some Ivy League judge angling for Georgetown cocktail party invitations wishes it says. We will become a beacon of freedom when the blue states’ Supreme Court finds the whole Bill of Rights unconstitutional. 2. We need to start over with the federal government. Department of Education? Nope, that’s a local function. Department of Commerce? How about we leave commerce to the businesspeople? The NEA? Are you kidding me – people should pay for their own perverted arts. The departure of the blue states is a chance to shed the unwanted pounds and unsightly flab packed onto what should be a lean, mean Uncle Sam after a century of gorging at the Golden Corral of progressivism. 3. We will expect everyone to pull his weight and support his family. Yes, there will be a safety net for those down on their luck. I’d propose a network of community gruel pots, but most people are probably not ready for that kind of innovative self-reliance incentive program. Regardless, the safety net won’t be comfortable, and frankly, people will look down on you for using it. So do what you need to do to avoid it – work hard, make good choices, save for a rainy day, and most of all, have the fierce self-respect that would have you do whatever it takes to avoid taking a government handout. And if you do those things, you’ll never have to. 4. Charity is a duty, but not a mandate. When the government “helps” you, it steals a piece of your soul. But when a neighbor lends a hand, that is soul craft for both of you. We’ll look out for our neighbors. We’ll watch their children when their car breaks down. We’ll give a kid who had a run-in with the law a chance at a job. We’ll pool our money to help a deserving teen go to college (There will be no more government student loans that drown their recipients in debt to pay off their Marxist Interpretive Dance degrees). Many hands-up, no hands-out. 5. We will embrace free enterprise, not crony capitalism. We need to strike down laws that protect entrenched business interests by keeping others from competing. In Tennessee, enterprising African-American women are being barred from providing braiding services by obnoxious laws that would first make them spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours getting licensed to shampoo hair. Not in Free America! Chief Justice Glenn Reynolds won’t allow it. 6. Free trade is great, except when the other side gets all sorts of advantages and our government does nothing because that would upset some corporate donor’s apple cart. The principle guiding our trade policy should be simple and clear – you can import whatever you want as long as we get identical terms back. Then, if you beat an American company, well, that’s on the American company. But if we beat yours, well, then we beat yours. 7. We will sell the blue states the necessities that they don’t want to make. The blue states’ elite is more concerned with posturing than productivity. Already, states like New York are banning the fracking technology that could make America energy independent. In California, the pampered coastal elite has declared war on Central Valley farmers. They are closing nuclear and coal plants, outsourcing their energy production. After they secede, it will only get worse – and we free Americans should pick up the slack, eagerly supplying the ravenous blue cities with the food, fuel, and power they won’t dirty their hands creating themselves. Plus, it gives us leverage when the blue states predictably start accusing us of causing their self-inflicted poverty and misery. 8. Let’s prosper with a tax code that does not punish success and ensures everyone has skin in the game. How about a flat 10%-15% income tax? What a great way to ensure everyone has an interest in a responsible, thrifty federal government – not just the 53% of us who pay the full freight today. 9. We should also welcome the high-tech companies currently residing in the blue states. They’ll be eager to come once they see our lower taxes and greater prosperity. Of course, they do tend to be liberal, and there is a lot of concern that allegedly “neutral” internet giants are actually trying to skew their products to support left wing causes. Now, what they do is their choice, but the particular intellectual property rights we choose to protect is our choice. We can always exclude from copyright and trademark protection any internet service that is not absolutely politically objective. So if they want to keep putting a thumb on the scale, we can always use our Apply iPaddles to do our searches on Goggle, post our cat photos on the Faceback, or troll libs on Tweeter. 10. Freedom means freedom. The blue states will clamp down on dissent, which will become permanently unpatriotic the second the liberal secession is complete. We need to be clear – while we will happily ship back all true criminals to face justice, no one will ever be extradited from the United States to the blue states to face prosecution for any crime related to the exercise of free speech. 11. Service earns citizenship. We’ll welcome our blue brothers and sisters as they escape the failure of their own governments, but not into the voting booth. For anyone not a veteran (or the spouse of one) or a resident at the secession, you will need to earn the right to vote, hold office, or hold a government position of significant reasonability by volunteering for and completing two years of honorable military service. And that means (with allowances for the severely physically handicapped) carrying a gun – not some bogus, puffball “alternative service” for rich kids handing out Kleenexes to delinquents while the poor kids hump rucks. If you haven’t dug a foxhole and shivered through the night in one, you are too insufficiently invested in Free America to have a say in its stewardship. We’re not having a bunch of Los Angeles refugees show up and bringing the stink of blue model failure with them. You want to pick up a ballot? First, pick up a rifle. And as a bonus, we will become North America’s Switzerland, with a rifleman (or riflewoman!) behind every tree, thereby discouraging the blue states from getting frisky when they inevitably blame us and our soaring prosperity for the inevitable failure of their socialist system. Naturally, it goes without saying that every able-bodied citizen of the United States will be expected to maintain personal arms and ammunition sufficient to allow him to act to protect his family, community, and Constitution. So, the loss of the blue states from the United States would be less a loss than an opportunity. Think of it as de facto federalism – the blue state model and the red state models can compete and people can judge the victor in terms of freedom and prosperity. I know who I’m betting on. Adios.

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/David Goldman Well, look what we have here, folks. It’s funny how Democrats and the liberal media have sprinted to alter course regarding mail-in ballots. For weeks, they peddled endlessly that because of COVID—everyone should vote by mail. Yeah, even Dr. Anthony Fauci said in-person voting was safe, sorry. If you can vote in-person, you should do it because this whole scheme has had hit after hit regarding security. We have mailboxes being broken into now, plus ballots being trashed. Some are being left on the ground. Multiple states have zero experience counting hordes of mailed in ballots. New York’s primaries were a nightmare. In some states, like Pennsylvania, they’re no longer rejecting ballots whose voter signatures do not match. Democrats are doing everything they can to steal the race. Period. And now, we have a mail carrier in New Jersey who was busted for, you guessed it—trashing ballots (via The Hill): Was wondering where mine was...  A Postal Service mail carrier in New Jersey was arrested Wednesday for allegedly discarding mail, including 99 general election ballots. Nicholas Beauchene was charged with one count of delay, secretion or detention of mail and one count of obstruction of mail. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the delay charge, and up to six months in prison and a $6,000 fine for obstruction. The discarded ballots were addressed to residents of West Orange, N.J., U.S. Attorney Craig Carpentino said. According to documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, approximately 1,875 pieces of mail were recovered from dumpsters in North Arlington and West Orange between Oct. 2 and Oct. 5. They were slated for delivery in Orange and West Orange. Prosecutors allege that Beauchene was the only mail carrier assigned to deliver to those addresses. He is scheduled to appear Wednesday in Newark federal court. On top of this, there’s a significant number of ballots being rejected as we speak. Also, the Postal Service has been clear that they cannot guarantee that everyone’s ballot will be delivered in time to be counted by officials. This scheme was stupid to begin with, and it birthed a conspiracy theory that makes QAnon look sane. How long did we hear about how Trump is planning to destroy the USPS? It got no pushback. In Paterson, New Jersey, 20 percent of the mailed in ballots for their municipal election were trashed over fraud concerns. It prompted a judge to invalidate the entire election. Voter fraud is real. It happens. And on a national scale, no doubt Democrats would try and steal this race. UPDATE: VP Pence and Kamala Harris are duking it out right now.

        "articles": "Omar Khadr is about to have himself a nice payday, though for all the wrong reasons. He was sent to Guantanamo Bay for killing an American solider, U.S. Army Sgt. First Class Christopher Speer, in Afghanistan. He was captured in an al-Qaeda compound, according to the Associated Press. While he pled guilty to various charges, including murder, and provided intelligence, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the circumstances during the interrogation were “oppressive.” As a result, he will be getting $8 million from the Canadian government, along with an apology (Fox News via Associated Press): The Canadian government will apologize and give millions to a former Guantanamo Bay prisoner who pleaded guilty to killing a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan when he was 15, an official said Tuesday. An official familiar with the matter told the Associated Press that Omar Khadr will receive $8 million. The deal was negotiated with Khadr’s lawyers and the Canadian government last month. Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a firefight at a suspected Al Qaeda compound in Afghanistan that resulted in the death of U.S. Special Forces medic, U.S. Army Sgt. First Class Christopher Speer. Khadr, who was suspected of throwing the grenade that killed Speer, was taken to Guantanamo and ultimately charged with war crimes by a military commission. The Canadian-born Khadr pleaded guilty in 2010 to charges that included murder and was sentences to eight years plus the time he had already spent in custody. He returned to Canada two years later to serve the remainder of his sentence and was released in May 2015 pending an appeal of his guilty plea, which he said was made under duress. The Canadian Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that Canadian intelligence obtained evidence from Khadr under “oppressive circumstances,” such as sleep deprivation, during interrogations at Guantanamo Bay in 2003, and then shared that evidence with U.S officials. AP added that the family of Speer and another solider who was blinded by the grenade filed a wrongful death and injury suit against Khadr, where they were awarded $134.2 million in 2015. Yet, the publication said since he’s in Canada, they’d probably never see a dime of the money. This legal action was executed when they found out Khadr planned a $20 million wrongful imprisonment suit against Canada. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Oprah Winfrey says she’s not running for president in 2020, contrary to the liberal hopes. Her Golden Globes speech set off Winfrey fever, but there are also more than a few liberals who are just appalled by the idea. In a field that rewards and shows deference to experience, there were more than a couple liberal writers from lefty publications that were not warm to Oprah 2020. Is she a successful businesswoman and television personality, like Trump? Yes. Could she win given what we’ve seen last year? There’s no reason to say no. After all, Trump wasn’t given a chance by anyone. In the long game, the Left sees an arc of ultra-wealthy celebrities with zero political experience running the White House. I would have to admit that’s not ideal, but it also shows another problem inherent within the Democratic Party. Long after Trump exits the White House to the cheers of legions of snowflakes everywhere I would assume, we have Nikki Haley, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, and others to fill the bench. The Democrats have no one, and that’s what some have mentioned in their screeds against a Winfrey presidential bid. Also, for all the bellyaching about how Trump couldn’t do the job, what makes you think Oprah could. It’s the moving of the goal posts in the grossest form imaginable. In a New York Times op-ed, Thomas Chatterton Williams wrote: I am not immune to Oprah’s charms, but President Winfrey is a terrible idea. It also underscores the extent to which Trumpism — the kowtowing to celebrity and ratings, the repudiation of experience and expertise — has infected our civic life. The ideal post-Trump politician will, at the very least, be a deeply serious figure with a strong record of public service behind her. It would be a devastating, self-inflicted wound for the Democrats to settle for even benevolent mimicry of Mr. Trump’s hallucinatory circus act. Indeed, the magical thinking fueling the idea of Oprah in 2020 is a worrisome sign about the state of the Democratic Party. That Ms. Winfrey could probably beat those considered likely front-runners — Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand — is testament to how demoralized and devoid of fresh political talent the post-Obama party has become. Osita Nwanevu of Slate emphasized a need for a candidate that has a deep understanding of policy and an agenda based on that knowledge in her piece against Oprah Winfrey as president: None of this is to say that political experience—that old, dry chestnut—is what counts the most here. Honesty with ourselves would force us to admit the country would be better off if we replaced every politician currently serving in Washington with a committee of social scientists, historians, and anxious, sweaty climatologists selected from the country’s major research universities at random. This is, of course, not the system of government we have, and we generally prefer filling the major political offices with people who know little, if anything, about the problems they are elected to fix. That’s an inevitable outcome of democracy, but ideally we’d be wise enough to save at least the presidency for those with deep knowledge of public policy. The solution here is to select a president who can shape deep knowledge into a robust, truly ambitious agenda that promises a future for this country beyond the incomprehensible misery we are all barreling toward, a candidate who can wed expertise and vision with the novel political rhetoric and expression voters clearly crave. Finding that person may require us to demand more from the cast of political characters we’ve already given ourselves. It does not require that we settle for Oprah. Well, I wouldn’t say Trump had an incomprehensible agenda. It was to deliver some economic relief to America’s working and middle classes, something that was clear on the campaign trail. Hillary Clinton had no economic message. While the president’s approval ratings are not the best, I’m bound to think it’s merely personal. Personally, a lot of people don’t like Trump, but when it comes to policy—there is notable improvement in those figures, specifically how Trump handles the economy. For the first time in 11 years, CNBC’s economic survey found that a majority was optimistic heading into 2018. Economic growth is near four percent, consumer confidence is at a 17-year high, and unemployment is at a near two-decade low. The tax bill was not some incomprehensible piece of the Trump agenda. It’s now law, and 80 percent of Americans will be getting substantial relief. Over a million workers have received bonuses since it became law, with scores of companies saying that not only are they doling out bonuses, they’re increasing employee investments in the U.S. and boosting philanthropic giving. Apple, which ahs longed to repatriate $250+ billion in overseas money, now has an opportunity to do so under a Republican president and Congress that reduced the rates. CEO Tim Cook thinks it’s good for the company and the country for him to execute this transfer, but under Obama, the rates were always in insanity-ville. Oh, as for jobs, Trump’s first year report was solid at 1.8 million created. This is not a bad agenda. And more voices were craving change—and Hillary Clinton was not their gal. Over at the Huffington Post, concern over celebrities taking over the wheel: Please let’s not do this again. Liberals want badly to believe they aren’t complicit in the Trump phenomenon, but what else was Trump but an expression of the same skepticism toward the actual work of politics that’s currently fueling the liberal Oprah fantasy? The dream is that Oprah is such a specimen of perfect virtue that she will create consensus wherever she walks. But the reality is that she’s so universally beloved right now largely because she is apolitical. […] Oprah and Trump aren’t so different in their relation to their fans. They both offer catharsis on the cheap, with Oprah as the liberal-values alternative to Trumpism — a better, more humane alternative, certainly, but the choice of a people determined to suppress the real conflicts at the heart of the country. Fortunately, we live in a world where we do not have only two options. Neither are we relegated to a pool of wealthy entertainers. The answer to Trump isn’t to elevate an aristocracy of celebrity right-mindedness, with Oprah or Tom Hanks ordering drone strikes with only the purest of intentions. The answer is to elevate politicians who do the politics better than the other guys. Liberals who think their program will prevail because of the nobility of their character have had the run of the Democratic Party long enough. Time’s up on them, too. I’m not saying Oprah shouldn’t run. She very well could change her mind. She’s wealthy. She has a following. She could do it. Trump had zero experience as well and the economy is booming, he got big credit from the South Koreans for getting North Korea at the negotiating table prior to the Winter Olympics, and he won the war against ISIS, the latter of which has been buried by the news media. Yet, the rush to her being seen as the messiah does show how the Left really doesn’t have anyone in the post-Obama era of the Democratic Party. The energy is gone, as seen by the DNC’s dismal fundraising hauls and evaporation of small donors. All of that has gone over to the GOP. Sanders could run again, but he too is a symbol of the Democratic Party’s troubles. He has a shelf life. And he’ll be damn near 80 by 2020. Is that the future? The same goes for Biden, who has run twice and lost. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand—has anyone heard of her past the Catskill Mountains? Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is like a cheap, discounted version of the former Democratic president, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) could plunge the party into another civil war, as Bernie supporters are not warm to her at all. There is a small governors poll, as Republicans occupy two-thirds of those mansions. Yes, their party is in trouble. No, Oprah probably won’t save them. And yes, if she does decided to run, I think Trump would beat her. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite Donald Trump is the odds-on fave to win reelection, and the Republicans can take back the House and keep the Senate if they aren’t stupid and incompetent – meaning it’s far from a done deal. But the Democrats are in a terrible position. The just and satisfying utter humiliation of crusty establishment hack Bob Mueller left them without a lot of good options going forward, since not being leftist idiots is obviously off the table. What do they do now that the entire soft coup hoax is a heap of garbage smoldering in the dumpster of American politics? Do they stick with Putin paranoia? Do they pivot to talking about their party’s platform? “Hey America, let’s invite the entire world in and you get to pay for their stuff. And also for everyone else’s college. And you also get to repay the debt you don’t owe to people who weren’t slaves. And we’re banning SUVs and BBQs because of the weather in 2119. Vote Democrat!” This is not a viable policy program, except in the freaks how hothouse of some pinko-filled town hall conducted by the Socialist Squaw, Spartacus or Beto, who is a furry. The Democrats are in a quandary. They can’t live with Russiagate and they can’t live without it. This is what happens when you get stuck because the quicksand you’re currently trapped in is less quick and less sandy than the quicksand you’d be stepping into. One option is to shut their eyes real tight, cover their ears and screech, “La la la la la la I can’t hear you!” This is why we were treated to the phenom of the Marxist marionettes on the MSNBCNNs and at the WaPos, as well as the commie blue checks on Twitter (whose new lay-out sucks – how come social media evolution always seems to mean that the product gets worse?), panicking for a bit before calming down and settling on a post-Mueller testimony narrative, which was essentially, “What Mueller testimony?” They simply deny the reality that his appearance on Capitol Hill will go down in history somewhere between Hiroshima and Nagasaki and proceed apace with their quest for the Holy Fail. The cliché used to be that if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it, but now the progs seem to think that if you repeat a lie often enough people will just get tired of the endless amateur gaslighting, shrug and give up. Another tactic is to double down on a bad hand – sort of like in blackjack when the dealer is showing a king and you have sixteen. Jerry Nadler cinched his belt tightly about his sternum, waddled up to the podium and announced that Mueller was no biggie and that The Nad was nowhere near finished with his investigation and that there was devastating evidence out there that Trump might have intentionally removed a mattress tag at Mar-A-Lago in 1972 at the behest of Boy Putin. Too bad for Big Jerry that moving goalposts doesn’t count as exercise. This is all bad news for the purple district Dems who ran in 2018 pretending that they were independent moderates who wanted to find solutions and work together to make a brighter tomorrow and blah blah blah blah blah. They specifically targeted the wussy suburban Republicans who found Trump icky but who would never vote for some brother-marrying loon or toothy commie cartoon character. Except those kooks are now in command in the Democrat Party and the pseudo-centrists are going to get them hung around their necks. Oh well. What the Blue Dork Dems would like to do is change the subject, but of course that would mean talking policy and popular policies are not the Democrats’ strong suit. There is just not a lot of enthusiasm out there in America for a bunch of schemes that generally involve Democrat-disfavored people like you and me paying our hard-earned money to subsidize Democrat-favored demographics like illegal aliens, shiftless bums, snooty academics and militant Maoist pottery majors. That’s why their current strategy is to try to capitalize on squishy suburban mommies’ loathing of Trump’s colorful character (Just pay no attention to the 3% unemployment and your expanding 401K behind the curtain!) and to paint themselves as solution-oriented problem solvers who solve problems using solutions. But then Congresswoman Bro-Hubby starts piping up with her own quirky riff on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and voters remember who’s actually running the show down at Donkey HQ. You would hope the GOP would take advantage of this. Cocaine Mitch, when he’s not churning out judge after wall-affirming judge, should be setting up vote after vote after vote on heinous Democrat proposals to get lib senators on the record and challenge ringmistress Nancy Pelosi to do the same. Republicans can slam their opponents for sticking with the Russia Neverending Story-ski, and then slam them again when the libs try to pivot to something else. Luckily, the GOP is full of savvy political geniuses who would never be so inept as to squander a winning hand by being stupid and weak. Speaking of stupid and weak, count on the Fredocon cruise crew at Conservative, Inc., to leverage its uncanny ability to achieve defeat in the face of overwhelming opportunity and to try to help the Democrats by changing the subject. It’s already starting. After putting their chips on the RUSSIA TREASON EMOULUMENTS TRAITOR COLLUSION MORE TREASON thing, some of our betters have decided that the best way to deal with the insane and begging-to-be-mocked Green New Deal is not to jam it down the moderates’ throats (“Hey soccer moms – that Ford Expedition you cart around your kids in is a no-go because of Gaia.”) but to embrace it. Yeah, because True Conservatism™ now means buying into the global warming hoax for some reason. Frank Luntz, who is a less entertaining Dick Morris without the credibility, and of course David French, both bought into the grift, but then again are you really surprised? Luntz famously announced “In case I wasn't clear enough from my previous tweets: Hillary Clinton will be the next President of the United States. #ElectionNight” on November 8, 2016, while French’s schtick for the last few years has been that Jesus hates Trump and, by extension, you. Conservatism for the Never Trump set was always about conserving their influence. Maybe they hope the pagan hot weather gods will make their Trumpy pain go away if they just pray to the climate fraud idols hard enough. Ahoy! The congressional Democrats are in a miserable position. Their party is under internal attack by leftist loons whose approval ratings are on par with syphilis. Their last three years were wasted chasing the collusion chimera. Their party platform demands Americans give up their doctors, their guns, their cars and their money. The only thing they have going for them is that their opponents are the Republicans. Come to think of it, the odds might actually be in their favor. For a look at what happens if Trump and the GOP fail, check out my action-packed yet hilarious novels about the United States’ split into red and blue countries, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire. These liberal-infuriating books have been called “Appalling” and have earned the hatred of loser leftists and the hapless geebos who sank the Weekly Standard.

        "articles": "Even though I was #nevertrump, I’m already so sick of listening to liberals whine about Trump that I’m tempted to throw on a “Make America Great Again” hat for no other reason than just to piss them off. You’re upset about Trump winning? Well, guess what? Conservatives were upset about Obama winning twice. Welcome to the party, pal. Oh, but liberals are special snowflakes whose feelings are more important than those of regular people. They need safe spaces, blankies and pacifiers to cope with trauma and they’re getting them at colleges across America. Therapy dogs were offered to traumatized students at the University of Kansas. Virginia Tech’s HokiePRIDE group posted national suicide hotline numbers. Liberal students are demanding “separate but equal” facilities for black students at the University of Michigan….yes, seriously. So, we have liberals DEMANDING SEGREGATION, but they’re still calling everyone else racist. You want an example of that? Here’s what hateful liberal George Takei wrote on Twitter, “Michael Flynn, Jeff Sessions, Steve Bannon. Islamophobe, Racist, Anti-Semite. This isn't a cabinet. It's a KKKabinet.” A liberal claiming everyone he doesn’t like is racist? Wow, how fresh and original! Of course, we all know that if John McCain, Mitt Romney or even Jeb Bush were President today, people like George Takei would be saying EXACTLY THE SAME THING. Mitt could have appointed all Mormon choir boys and the Left would still be painting them as David Duke. Speaking of David Duke, have you ever noticed that since he’s a pariah in the Republican Party, any and all influence he has is generated by liberal outlets writing about what he says? Along similar lines, liberals seem to have concluded that Trump’s victory is all about racism. Here are just a tiny smattering of headlines from liberal websites pushing exactly that theme. Trump's win is a reminder of the incredible, unbeatable power of racism There's No Such Thing as a Good Trump Voter This Election Has Completely Debunked The Myth Of A ‘Post-Racial’ America White flight from reality: Inside the racist panic that fueled Donald Trump’s victory How rational is it to assume that the people in a country that voted for a black President twice suddenly decided Trump is a bigot and they like it? Especially since the share of minority voters Trump received WENT UP from the numbers that Romney got? How about the fact that, “Of the nearly 700 counties that twice sent Obama to the White House, a stunning one-third flipped to support Trump. Trump also won 194 of the 207 counties that voted for Obama either in 2008 or 2012.” Even Kanye West came out and said he would have voted for Trump if he had bothered to vote. Does that make him a white supremacist? I really don’t get that vibe from him. It may not make sense to assume that the country voted for Trump because of racism, but there is one great thing about it from the liberal perspective: it implies that the problem isn’t you. It’s not you tediously smearing everyone who doesn’t agree with you. It’s not Obama losing the war in Afghanistan and Iraq while cutting a deal that will allow Iran to get nuclear weapons. It’s not forcing gay marriage on a country that mostly didn’t want it and demanding that mentally ill men be allowed to use bathrooms with little girls. It’s not the complete liberal indifference to the size of the debt or the incessant lying that liberal politicians like Obama, Hillary and Harry Reid engage in. It’s not the failure to secure the border, Obama suing the Little Sisters of the poor or Hillary’s disgusting, “I’m a woman, so you have to vote for me” campaign. No, the problem is that everyone is racist….except Lena Dunham, Cher, you and your liberal pals. Just consider Obamacare as a standalone issue. The critics of Obamacare turned out to be almost entirely right about Obamacare while few of the promises Barack Obama made about the program turned out to be true. It was passed with no Republican votes, the rollout was a disaster and it was NEVER popular. Yet and still, liberals seem to think the program is the greatest thing since sliced bread because it covers more people. Meanwhile, a much larger group of Americans have seen their health care costs take off like a rocket. Let me give you an example. I was talking to a non-political friend of mine who was initially a little excited about Obamacare because she qualified for a subsidy the first year. However, after she started making slightly more and didn’t qualify, she became horrified at how expensive her insurance payments became. She was told that if she wants the same plan this year, it will be $380 a month, which she can’t afford. She voted for Trump. When liberals write off people like her as racists, it’s a way of absolving themselves from all the problems they’ve created in the country and in people’s lives over the last eight years. Let me add that if you want to have a pointless protest swollen with people you hired from Craigslist, could you at least avoid rioting and stay out of the street so that you don’t block traffic? Is that asking too much? Oh…..because your feelings are hurt that the rest of the country picked someone you didn’t like, throwing a brick through a window or blocking traffic is okay. Right? Wrong. Your incessant attacks on white people for the color of their skin are fine, but people voting for a candidate you don’t like must be racist. Every time there’s a fight provoked at a Trump rally by a Democratic operative, you think the black night of fascism is descending on America, but you turn a blind eye to people being beaten for wearing a MAGA hat. You think it’s okay for celebrities and CEOs to say things like, “Letting trump take office means burying democracy. Letting him take it without the popular vote means burying it alive.” – Jos Whedon “Our country hates Jews, muslims, women, black people, LGBTQ, and women. That's the only takeaway from tonight.” -- Timothy Simons from Veep “Further I absolutely reject the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump and will work to shield our community from this movement as best as I can. As we all try to understand what this vote means to us, I want to affirm to anyone on our team that is scared or feels personally exposed, that I and everyone else here at Grubhub will fight for your dignity and your right to make a better life for yourself and your family here in the United States. If you do not agree with this statement then please reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here.” – Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney You think this is such a racist country? You think it’s such a rotten place? You’re getting on your high horse about Trump when you were supporting HILLARY @#$%^!* Clinton? Then go to Canada. Have your Calexit. If only we could FORCE California to leave the United States. If that’s your attitude, then the country would be better off without you.

        "articles": "What happened to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)? She used to be rational when it came to Supreme Court nominations. In 2006, when Senate Democrats were mulling what to do with Judge Samuel Alito (now Justice Alito), the California Senator told Bob Schieffer, then-host of CBS’ Face The Nation, that a filibuster of Alito would be unlikely because you can’t just block a Supreme Court nominee just because you disagree with him or her. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: “I do not see the likelihood of a filibuster to be very candid with you. I don't see those kinds of egregious things emerging that would justify a filibuster. I think when it comes to filibustering a Supreme Court appointment; you really have to have something out there whether it's gross moral turpitude or something that comes to the surface. Now I mean, this is a man I might disagree with. That doesn't mean he shouldn't be on the court.” Flash forward to 2017 and Feinstein is opposing Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch because…she doesn’t like him. And she wants to get the GOP back for gumming up the works for Merrick Garland, Obama’s initial nominee to fill the vacancy left by Antonin Scalia. I guess you could ask where did 2006 Feinstein go? This seems rational, unlike the Left's descent into madness post-2016. At the same time, for all her talk, Feinstein tried to stop Alito. One of her partners in crime in that effort was Barack Obama. There is no good reason to oppose Gorsuch. He has the backing of jurists and legal scholars from across the political spectrum. His hearings were described as nothing short of a home run. Senate Republicans should nuke the rules and get him confirmed. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Source: (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, Pool) Speaking at the White House Tuesday night, Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed President Biden will follow through with campaign promises to ban new fracking on federal land. \"President Biden promised to end all new oil and gas leasing on federal lands when was a candidate,\" a reporter asked. \"Does the administration still have that commitment today? To end that lease?\" \"We do and the leases will be reviewed by our team we just have only been in office for less than a day now,\" Psaki said. Earlier Tuesday, Biden signed an executive order placing the United States back into the Paris Climate Agreements, despite the country reducing emissions without being in the global agreement. He also revoked permits for the Keystone XL pipeline, eliminating 11,000 jobs and destroying $2 billion in wages. From Fox Business: The move could happen on President-elect Joe Biden's first day in office, after the Trump administration spent four years trying to further construction of the $9 billion, 1,200-mile pipeline that would transport up to 830,000 barrels of crude oil daily from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska. An existing Keystone pipeline currently transports oil from Alberta to Illinois and Texas. According to the Keystone XL website, the project, initially proposed more than a decade ago, would sustain about 11,000 U.S. jobs in 2021 – including 8,000 union jobs – and generate $1.6 billion in gross wages. It is unclear how the Biden administration plans to address the job losses, but his $2 trillion clean energy infrastructure plan, with its goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, aims to \"create millions of good-paying jobs that provide workers with the choice to join a union and bargain collectively with their employers,\" according to his website. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez The fascist left regularly typifies the very qualities it professes to abhor. The only thing more pronounced than its totalitarianism is its stunning lack of self-awareness. It's ironic that leftists think of themselves as liberals, as the term \"liberal\" is historically and etymologically connected to the concept of liberty. Not only are they merely selective champions of liberty but the logical extension of their agenda is an eradication of liberty, from socialism to Supreme Court legislation, from radical redistributions of income to oppressive pseudo-environmental regulations. What do I mean by \"selective champions of liberty\"? Simply that they believe conservative ideas are so odious they must be excluded from the classroom; social media; university student organizations; and, in too many cases, restaurants, yard signs and baseball caps. Try teaching intelligent design in many public schools. In the name of science, they'll exclude ID's scientific findings. They believe that conservatives and their ideas are inherently racist and sexist and, in many cases, lead to violence, which means conservatives are not entitled to First Amendment protection or free expression on social media. It's scary how these leftists have blinded themselves to their own hypocrisy and fascism in trampling the same rights they purport to celebrate. Invisible authoritarians running social media platforms cite arbitrary rules of conduct that conveniently censor conservative opinion to allegedly ensure decency and decorum. Yet the opinions they muzzle are only dangerous and indecent if you define danger as the free expression of opposing views. While prohibiting conservative views that don't remotely advocate violence, they permit overt leftist calls for violence. The chilling process by which this \"private\" and sometimes-government-supported censorship occurs is that leftists subjectively determine conservative speech is offensive or hateful and must be banned. The First Amendment free-speech guarantees were designed precisely to protect controversial political speech, as uncontroversial expression obviously needs no protection. In the not-too-distant past, liberals understood that protecting the expression of all ideas was the essence of liberty. Yesterday's American Civil Liberties Union defended the rights of neo-Nazis to march through Skokie, Illinois, in 1978. Examples of the tyrannical leftist mindset abound. Nicholas Sandmann's admission to Transylvania University in Kentucky incensed certain leftists. They clearly loathe Sandmann, who was brutally slandered by CNN and other leftists when activists accosted him for simply wearing a MAGA hat and standing for the pro-life cause. \"Does anyone else think it's a bit of a stain on Transylvania University for accepting Nick Sandmann? I'm sure it's a 'both sides' defense, but it's pretty counter to their mission and another instance of there not being equal sides to an issue,\" wrote ACLU staffer Samuel Crankshaw on Facebook. \"This kid clearly is a provocateur in training with no intention of learning. He exists only to troll, intimidate and play victim.\" \"Counter to their mission\"? What mission would that be: the promulgation of leftist propaganda and the suppression of opposing ideas? Note Crankshaw's revealing admission that he doesn't believe there are even two sides to the Sandmann controversy. This is more remarkable considering that the media's original reporting of this event was debunked at the time and then more resoundingly discredited when Sandmann settled a major defamation suit against CNN and others. Despite Sandmann's vindication, this ranting ACLU ideologue can't even acknowledge that Sandmann had a legitimate position. And without knowing Sandmann personally, Crankshaw presumes he has no intention of learning -- leftist open-mindedness on parade. Crankshaw isn't alone. Transylvania University professor Avery Tompkins, who paradoxically identifies as a \"diversity scholar,\" went further. \"If (Sandmann) were to cause problems by being disruptive, trolling, or engaging in unethical behavior of any kind, I would immediately document it ... and he would just be putting himself in a position for me to file a conduct report,\" commented Tompkins on Crankshaw's Facebook page. This unmistakably reads like a threat against Sandmann should he express his views. If that weren't sickening enough, Tompkins' claims are preposterous. Sandmann wasn't disruptive at the pro-life march. He trolled no one; a Native American man approached and taunted him, obnoxiously banging a drum in his face. Nor did Sandmann behave unethically, unless, perhaps, you believe that gathering in support of innocent unborn babies is unethical. Tompkins' thinking is disturbing (though I would still defend his freedom to express this stupidity), as is his attempted intimidation of a student entering his university. It's rich that on the university website, Tompkins is quoted as saying: \"I don't want to be the authoritative person in the classroom. ... The classes are there for the students. It's not my soapbox.\" Hmm. Could have fooled this casual observer. Tompkins' later apology in which he paid lip service to \"diversity\" is laughable. He is an adult with fully formed ideas, and a poster child for illustrating that the left's idea of \"diversity\" means anything but ideological diversity. Another example involved leftist University of Rhode Island professor Erik Loomis, who defended an anarchist's murder of Trump supporter Aaron Danielson in Portland. \"He killed a fascist,\" Loomis said. \"I see nothing wrong with it, at least from a moral perspective.\" This abomination speaks for itself. Before you call this an extreme example, note that this kind of thinking drives the widespread leftist violence throughout American cities that was enabled by Democratic governors and mayors. I wouldn't be so alarmed about any of this if the left weren't promising to ratchet up its violence if President Donald Trump is reelected. If you doubt this, you're not paying attention, and as young people say, \"That's on you.\" Prayers and more prayers for this great nation. David Limbaugh is a writer, author and attorney.

        "articles": "So now we come to a moment of truth. Finally the tripartite first round of primary season is upon us, Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Americans must make a choice. The choice, on the Republican side, is between anger and various flavors of seasoned professionalism. On the Democrat side, it is between transparent criminality and eclectic, wooly-headed socialism. So, what should the average voter do? First, like many others, I love the lessons taught by Ronald Reagan. He really was a beacon in the storm, and remains one now. By some happy accident, the “young me” worked in Ronald Reagan’s White House, a deeply thoughtful, always cheerful, inherently magnanimous, and rightly-revered center of strategic thinking, instinctive goodness. He never played on people’s personal antipathies, recriminations, prejudices, or anger. It was not in him. He did present “stubborn facts,” about places like the Soviet Union and about the constitutional dangers of Federal overreach. About Reagan, one more personal observation. In three years I worked off and on in his first term White House, and in subsequent interactions with those closest to him, and in visits to California to meet with him, there are about ten traits I NEVER saw. Let me be specific. I never saw in Ronald Reagan: Taunting. Personal anger. Arrogance. Intentional offense. Preoccupation with Power. Self-adulation. Ignorance on America’s defense and intelligence strategies, or The Nuclear Triad. Playing “fast and loose” with truth. Constitutional misunderstandings. Dismissiveness of geopolitical leadership, disparagement of diplomacy, or disinterest in critical details. I saw the reverse. Ronald Reagan was about positive leadership, which was defined by patience and communication in things he felt mattered – did matter. Like most life-living conservatives, he saw “issues” as a reflection of timeless conservative principles – consistently applied. That is why his entire life centered on being a listener, educator and respectful leader. He was content inside himself, never angry. He was about elevating our “better angels.” Ronald Reagan counted himself a lucky, other-regarding man. That role was a burden carried for us – for the Nation. He aspired to be equal to his time. Nor did Reagan, despite his military service and consistent moral depth, ever present himself to the American people as better for his wealth. He spent decades explaining the need to shrink government, defeat the Soviet Union, and preserve individual liberty – and was NEVER a showboat. He was deep and deeply kind. I worked for Ronald Reagan and later as a Bush appointee for Colin Powell. Here is what I have learned, at the elbows of good leaders. There is an important – absolutely critical – difference between an inspired, consistent and conservative leader on one hand – and the cheap, easy, media-centric substitute. Frothy, populist anger is no substitute for principled leadership. Let us jump ahead to now. So, as these big primaries come at us, we can either be our best selves – looking hard at the options and choosing thoughtfully, with a combination of mind and heart, someone closer to Reagan … or miss the chance. We can either select a consistent conservative leader, or lose the chance. If anger at Obama is ubiquitous, it is insufficient for selecting a president. Anger gave the country Obama. The time and opportunity is for a real, earnest, proven and thoughtful, firm and consistent conservative. That voice is Ted Cruz. Who is Cruz? For sure a few things: Honest, proven and circumspect, someone who has shown depth – in ALL areas that matter. If Reagan was elected on six words – strong defense, smaller government, lower taxes – Ted Cruz seems to get that. He also has a natural understanding of the Gipper on two other traits: Moral compass, and strategic foresight. The world is more tossed by moral relativism than in Reagan’s day, and more complex. Senator Cruz seems practiced on the big stage, and proven himself in both categories. His days as Supreme Court litigator forced him to adopt a lifestyle that was invariably well prepared and strategic. The Nation would benefit from those skills in a president. Mastery of the complex is a modern imperative, as is distinguishing right from wrong. Seldom have Republican primary voters had this chance, the opportunity to choose a leader who is strategic and morally grounded, master the game and moral. American conservatives seem to have that chance now. Winston Churchill said: “It takes courage to stand up and speak; and it takes courage to sit down and listen.” Trump has shown impulsiveness of a jarring sort. The Supreme Court litigator and Senator is ready to engage, also ready to listen. He has not cut and run – ever. Needed now is steady, stable, sound judgment. If there is a trait that Cruz showcases, it seems this one. That should be true in Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina and across the country. In the end, words have meaning. History is our best reference. There are enormous similarities in the world views of Ronald Regan and Ted Cruz. In all events, the Reagan legacy would seem a far cry from what Mr. Trump is selling, something far anger, bombast, and constant admiration of the problem – without solutions. He is a strange swirl of liberal pro-government, America-Greatism, and rolling, verbal slights. Reagan was so much deeper, far more real, far more like what Ted Cruz. Whatever the timber of Mr. Trump’s voice, Reagan was very different – and Trump is a shadow of the strength that resides in Cruz. I prefer a sound investment to a lottery ticket. Robert B. Charles worked in the White Houses of Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush. He taught congressional oversight and law at Harvard University’s Extension School, clerked on the US Court of Appeals, served two US House Speakers, and was the Assistant Secretary of State charged with training the Iraqi and Afghan police. He has written widely on national security, constitutional law and national policy. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may have backing for her Green New Deal from fellow progressive politicians but if the widespread criticism she’s received hasn’t been telling enough for her, perhaps the renewable energy sector’s dismissal of it will be. Representatives from solar and wind companies lauded the “enthusiasm” behind the GND but called it out for being completely unrealistic and too politically divisive, according to a Reuters report. Here’s a sampling of the quotes in the report: “If you just broadly endorse the Green New Deal, you are liable to upset one side of the aisle or the other. And that’s not constructive,” said Tom Werner, the CEO of SunPower Corp, one of the nation’s biggest solar power companies. “The idea that you could go 100 percent (clean energy) in 10 years would require a lot of things happening perfectly, simultaneously,” he said. “You’d have to have bipartisan support, 52-state support.” […] “We love the enthusiasm the Green New Deal has brought to the climate issue ... but we need to operate in political reality,” said Dan Whitten, vice president of public affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association, the solar industry’s main lobby group. […] “We have raised these industries above science experiments and feel-goodery, and we are now real businesses and can’t just play to one half of the country,” said one renewable sector lobbyist, who asked not to be named discussing the topic. “Staying out of the line of fire is the goal of most companies and trade associations,” said another clean energy industry representative. “There will be a real danger for our industry and companies if they are shouting out about the Green New Deal from the rooftops.” […] “We’ve met with companies and industries who could have a lot to gain from the Green New Deal, but the politics at this stage are too difficult to navigate,” Sunrise co-founder Evan Weber said. (Reuters) The report notes that with better technology that enabled renewable energy businesses to lower prices, wind and solar companies are expanding their growth from blue, coastal states into the red heartland. They simply cannot afford to risk losing a growing base of clients. Ocasio-Cortez introduced the resolution last month along with Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Promising a “massive transformation of our society,” some of the resolution’s goals include retrofitting every building in America to be energy efficient, eliminating air travel, cars, and fossil fuel and nuclear energy, as well as guaranteeing jobs.

        "articles": "If every conservative and moderate in America disappeared tomorrow, liberals would party like they won the Super Bowl. Five years later, the entire economy would collapse; Cuba, Mexico and Canada would be occupying parts of the United States and President Bernie Sanders would be encouraging people to burn down the remaining businesses that hadn’t gone under to protest unemployment. They’re pursuing both spending and immigration policies that could fairly be called suicidal for America. On the international scene, Obama has managed to restart the Cold War with Russia, throw away two wars Bush had already won in Afghanistan and Iraq and has enabled the rise of ISIS. If there is a part of America that’s important or works, liberals are systematically trying to destroy it. We HAD – emphasis on the word HAD – the best healthcare system in the world before Obamacare. Under Obama’s incompetent leadership, the economy STILL hasn’t recovered from the housing crash of 2007. Marriage was already in trouble; so rather than trying to fix it, liberals were like, “Hey, let’s kick that all the way down the stairs with gay marriage! Then we’ll push a refrigerator down the stairs behind it with polygamy next!” Despite the fact that we now have the first black president, his supporters have spent practically his entire presidency trying to create race riots and foment hatred between black and white Americans. As a rule, liberals support stupid, counter-productive policies that do more harm than good to the country. This is what I mean by saying that they’re “mainstreaming dumb.” However, we’ve now gotten to the point where liberals are “mainstreaming crazy.” By that, I mean there is increasingly a merger of thought between radical college professors, weird feminists, commenters on the Daily Kos and Democrat senators. By the time some fruit loop at Berkeley spouts off a half-thought-out piece of ludicrous nuttery, an article has been written about it and you’ve had time to roll your eyes and say, “Ugh, what a kook,” some Democrat congressman is publicly agreeing with him. For example, if you don’t get “affirmative consent” before sex, it’s considered rape on some campuses. The same goes if your partner has been drinking. That’s not just dumb; it’s crazy. By that standard, practically every man in America is a rapist. None of it is “rape” in the sense that normal human beings think of rape. In fact, it’s hard to believe human beings who’ve had intimate encounters came up with this. It seems more like a system that space aliens who’ve seen human mating from afar would have devised. Then consider the #blacklivesmatter nut bags. Basically, these losers run around the country randomly blocking traffic and deliberately annoying people to protest the police. Setting aside the fact that it would be impossible to ever please these crackpots since they side with criminals who try to take the guns of police officers and they oppose using ANY amount of force to arrest resisting suspects, they’re habitually stupid, rude and obnoxious. Yet, this gang of idiots managed to force Democratic Presidential nominee Martin O’Malley to apologize for saying “All lives matter.” Yes, saying “All Lives Matter” is now a major gaffe on the Left. Wow. Then, there is the Left’s complete inability to handle gender, something most children have grasped by the time they’re four years old. It’s one thing to cater to people who are mentally ill and to falsely tell them that they can become another sex. It’s not true, it’s not good for them and they’d be better off if they just went to therapy, but liberals are wrong about pretty much everything else; so it’s no surprise they’re wrong about that, too. However, liberals are now demanding that all of society cater to other people’s mental illnesses. They want BIRTH CERTIFICATES changed to falsify the gender of people who now identify as a different gender. They get outraged if people refer to a man, with his genitalia still dangling between his legs, as a man. They believe that if Norman Bates gets up today, puts on his mother’s dress and says he feels like a woman, then he should be able to use the women’s bathroom and anybody who complains is a bigot. This sounds like the sort of vision of society some maladjusted kid who was left by himself to grow up in an abandoned Barbie factory would come up with; yet, it’s what liberals now believe. Then there’s abortion. Hey, we all know the only thing liberals love better than killing babies is getting paid to kill babies, but they used to at least try to hide the blood on their hands. Remember when liberals used to say that they believed abortion should be “safe, legal and rare?” Sure, it wasn’t true, but at least they felt obliged to say it to keep from looking bloodthirsty. Then we moved on to, “We support abortion anytime, anywhere for any reason.” Your baby has an issue? Abort her! You got a girl and you wanted a boy? Abort her! Is the pregnancy going to ruin your selfies when you go on a vacation to the beach later this year? Abort her! Well, now, we’ve veered from heartless all the way into psychopathy because the liberal position is that it’s okay to abort children and then SELL THE BABY PARTS FOR PROFIT. The closest thing that comes to mind to what Planned Parenthood is doing today is what the Nazis did during WWII. Even liberals would have probably (Who knows with them anymore?) opposed selling the organs ripped out of dead babies for profit if you’d asked them about it a month ago, but once they found out Planned Parenthood was doing it, they were uniformly behind something that can legitimately be compared to a Nazi war atrocity. How do you sleep at night when in 2015 you’re supporting the moral equivalent of the Nazis using human skin to make lampshades*? To have so many Americans embracing this kind of depravity and madness doesn’t bode well for the future of the country. * Hat tip to Ben Shapiro for the lampshade analogy. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Lee rightly observes that conservatives aren't exactly threatening to shut down the government, nor do they want to. Their goal is to fully fund the government -- prioritizing key line items like paying the troops, sending out Social Security checks and servicing the debt -- while simply omitting the parcel of spending devoted to Obamacare. If Harry Reid and Barack Obama refuse to go along with this plan, these Senators argue, it would be Democrats who'd force any potential shutdown. After the floor exchange concluded, conservative Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma offered an extended rebuttal, applauding his colleagues for their passion in resisting a fatally flawed law, but questioning the efficacy of their game plan. Coburn, a medical doctor and fiscal hawk, notes that he's combated Obamacare ever since it was introduced in 2009. He also reminds Cruz & Co. that he's voted against every recent CR because he opposes them in principle, believing them to be an irresponsible form of piecemeal governance. But he submits that risking a shutdown showdown over a fraction of Obamacare funding (much of which falls in the \"mandatory spending\" category, and would be unaffected anyway) is misguided and counter-productive: Taken together, all of these polls suggest that an effort that is framed as defunding Obamacare is likely a political loser, while efforts to delay two of Obamacare’s most central and least popular provisions—its individual mandate and its fraud-friendly exchanges—would likely be embraced by all but the far left of the political spectrum. If congressional Republicans decide to make approval of a continuing resolution or a debt-limit increase contingent upon anything relating to Obamacare, delay of these two central elements would seem to offer the best chance for rallying public support. NYT: People questioned your legal and constitutional authority to do that unilaterally — to delay the employer mandate. Did you consult with your lawyer? MR. OBAMA: Jackie, if you heard me on stage today, what I said was that I will seize any opportunity I can find to work with Congress to strengthen the middle class, improve their prospects, improve their security – NYT: No, but specifically – MR. OBAMA: — but where Congress is unwilling to act, I will take whatever administrative steps that I can in order to do right by the American people. And if Congress thinks that what I’ve done is inappropriate or wrong in some fashion, they’re free to make that case. But there’s not an action that I take that you don’t have some folks in Congress who say that I’m usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency. And I don’t think that’s a secret. But ultimately, I’m not concerned about their opinions — very few of them, by the way, are lawyers, much less constitutional lawyers...I’m not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next 1,200 days. Poll: 80 percent of Independents and two thirds of Democrats favor delay/repeal of individual mandate.  .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Americans rode in wagon trains across this country, tossed the Brits’ tea in the Boston Harbor, outfought the superpower of the 18th century to get our freedom, pounded the Indians, Mexicans, and Spanish into the ground to fulfill our Manifest Destiny and then for an encore, we saved the planet in WWI, WWII, and the Cold War. Our pioneer-pilgrim, hard-fighting, gold-mining, wagon-training, gun-fighting ancestors were so hard, Kid Rock's American Bad Ass should have played when they walked into a room. We conquered a continent, built the Hoover Dam, went to the moon, and not only did our Olympic athletes refuse to dip our flag to Hitler during the 1936 Olympics, we made the most evil man who ever lived kill himself in fear before we could get to him. That's the stock that Americans come from, which begs an obvious question: What the hell happened to us? How did the toughest, most independent society since Sparta turn into a wuss factory full of people who've never had an adventure in their life outside of a video game? We now have an entire grievance industry full of losers who spend all their time complaining that they're \"offended\" by everything from the name of the Redskins to the \"Patriarchy\" to politicians using \"violent language\" like \"crosshairs\" and \"job killing.\" Can you imagine a member of the Greatest Generation complaining because a Japanese soldier called him a mean name? Do you think the wagon trains on the Oregon Train were more worried about \"isms\" or trying to avoid dying of dysentery and being scalped? So back to that central question: How did Americans get so soft, so fast? There are a lot of answers to that question. The military has gotten smaller; so fewer people serve; a lot of manly professions have faded away; our society has economically prospered to the point of decadence even if many people don't realize it; liberalism encourages wimpiness and failure....we could go on and on. However, the biggest problem we have is that we're systematically teaching our kids to be wusses. The problem is that it doesn't matter how pretty, rich, or gifted you are; life is a pile of bricks coming towards you at 100 MPH and no matter how smart you are, how hard you work, or how often you do the right thing, it's going to clip you ever so often. You're going to lose a job, someone's going to die or decide he doesn't want to be your friend any more, you're going to have a stretch of bad luck, your hard work will be unrewarded, you're going to face financial stress, people are going to laugh at you -- no matter how charmed your life may be, it happens to EVERYONE. Is this how we're going to prepare our kids for those unhappy eventualities? 1) Ban \"Bossy:\" This is the hot new idea on the \"Left.\" Apparently if we \"ban\" the word \"bossy,\" little girls will all grow up to be decisive leaders or something. Of course, if being called \"bossy\" is enough to dissuade a little girl from being a leader, she probably isn't cut out to be a leader in the first place. It doesn't matter if it's online, in Hollywood, at your local PTA, or in school; if you lead or gain a little status, someone will immediately start to undercut you. Typically, the words used are a lot less benign than \"bossy,\" too. Sarah Palin knows a little something about being hit with abuse for being successful and as she would say, either \"buck up or stay in the truck.\" 2) Microaggressions: This is a bit of popular silliness that has taken off on college campuses. Basically, since liberals are having trouble finding any overt racism to complain about, the general idea is supposed to be that someone is committing a \"microaggression\" against you by denying that he’s a racist, sexist, or even just by annoying a minority in some way. In fact, including microaggressions in this column counts as a \"microaggression.\" In other words, the idea is supposed to be whiny losers always have some \"ism\" to be aggrieved over every time they feel bad, which is pretty much all the time because that's what life as a whiny loser is like. 3) Trigger Warnings: This is another bit of wackiness that has taken off on college campuses and I'll just use the Urban dictionary definition of it since it's as good as any other, Translation: instead of encouraging people to talk to a friend, get therapy, or just get over whatever is bothering them, it's everyone else's responsibility to warn others that they might be saying something that could trouble the legions of easily offended left-wing groups out there. Try that at your job some time and see what your boss says about it -- and don't expect a trigger warning before you get fired. Life is not only full of unpleasantness, it's full of things that remind you of that unpleasantness. Part of leaving childhood behind and becoming an adult is dealing with that fact. 4) Zero Tolerance Gun Policies at Schools: After Columbine, it's understandable that schools might be on the alert for weapons at school, but they've cranked things up to Salem-Witch-Trial levels of hysteria. There are kids who've been suspended for saying the word “gun,” chewing a Pop Tart into the shape of a gun or in the latest case, there's a girl being threatened with expulsion for having a razor blade in her possession for as long as it took to get it away from a kid who was trying to cut his wrists. Every man should at least know his way around a gun; firearms benefit women even more since they're unlikely to be able to outfight a man who wants to beat, rape or murder them. How does teaching kids to turn into a jellied mass of quivering fear because some kid chewed a gun into a Pop Tart square with the importance of knowing how to use firearms for adults? 5) The Self-Esteem Movement: There is actually a basic formula for building self-esteem. You find something you have talent at, you work at it, your ability is recognized and you feel better about yourself. However, we've moved past that formula and may have become the first society in history to almost entirely disconnect self-esteem from accomplishment. It's debatable whether our schools should be focusing on building the self-esteem of kids at all, but we certainly shouldn't be teaching every kid that he's a special little sunflower, regardless of whether he's done anything to earn it. Yes, God thinks all of His kids are special, but the rest of us generally aren't impressed with someone who has nothing going for him other than the fact that he exists and his teacher says nice things about him. The world doesn't owe you a living, you're not special just because your teacher didn't mark your papers with red ink, and the harsh truth is that the world values you for what you bring to the table, not because your life has been one long series of participation trophies.

He was 87. \"It is with unbearable pain that I announce the death of my husband, Sheldon G. Adelson, of complications from a long illness. Sheldon was the love of my life. He was my partner in romance, philanthropy, political activism and enterprise. He was my soulmate. To me - as to his children, grandchildren, and his legions of friends and admirers, employees and colleagues - he is utterly irreplaceable,\" Miriam Adelson, his wife, released in a statement Tuesday morning. \"Much has been written and said about how Sheldon, the son of poor immigrants, rose to the pinnacle of business success on the strength of grit and genius, inspiration and integrity. His was an all-American story of entrepreneurship. When Sheldon launched a new venture, the world looked on with anticipation. In our amazing 32-year adventure together, I was fortunate to witness the beauty of Sheldon's private side.\" \"He was an American patriot: a U.S. Army veteran who gave generously to wounded warriors and, wherever he could, looked to the advancement of these great United States. He was the proudest of Jews, who saw in the State of Israel not only the realization of an historical promise to a unique and deserving people, but also a gift from the Almighty to all of humanity,\" she continued. \"And Sheldon was kind. He gave readily of his fortune to charitable causes that may literally be countless, as he expected no credit and often preferred anonymity. Although bluff in build and speech - and, in the last two decades, beset by painful sickness - Sheldon was always sensitive to the needs of others.\" Adelson's company, Las Vegas Sands, also released a statement. \"Our founder and visionary leader, Sheldon G. Adelson, passed away last night at the age of 87 from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,\" they said. \"Born to immigrant parents and raised in a poor section of Boston, Mr. Adelson went from a teenager selling newspapers on a street corner to becoming one of the world's most successful entrepreneurs. His achievements in the integrated resort and hospitality industry are well-documented.\" \"When the pandemic disrupted daily routines and dramatically impacted his business, Mr. Adelson was adamant that our Team Members across the globe continue to receive full pay and health care benefits even while the buildings in which they worked were closed. There are countless additional untold stories of his warmth and generosity – efforts for which he never sought recognition or publicity and would only reply with a smile if asked about them,\" they continued. \"While his business credentials – having started or been involved in more than 50 different enterprises - are unquestioned, his dedication to philanthropy and commitment to his family will truly be his legacy. He will be missed by people from all parts of the world who were touched by his generosity, kindness, intellect and wonderful sense of humor. The Adelson family asks for privacy as they mourn Mr. Adelson's passing. A funeral will be held in Israel, the birthplace of Dr. Miriam Adelson, with plans for a memorial service held in Las Vegas to be announced at a later date.\" The greatest Jewish philanthropist of our times, Mr. Sheldon Adelson has passed away. May his memory be blessed for all time.Baruch dayan emet. Sheldon Adelson’s life represents the best of the American dream. Susan and I send our deepest condolences and prayers to his family as the world mourns his passing. pic.twitter.com/QkL60v7iOE It’s impossible to fully capture what a titan Sheldon Adelson was in every aspect of life. He was a genuine Horacio Alger story who pioneered his industry and changed Las Vegas. He was as selfless and philanthropic as anyone I’ve ever met. He was a hero. Sheldon Adelson lived a true American life. Born from humble beginnings he achieved extraordinary things. He was a defender of America, a champion of Israel & a friend. His good deeds & legacy will continue to shape the lives of millions. We send our love & prayers to his family. pic.twitter.com/ncthuAeCoN Saddened by death of Sheldon Adelson who went from poverty to wealth by vision & hard work.

        "articles": "We've been told conservatives don't believe in science and that there's a \"Republican war on science.\" But John Tierney, who's written about science for The New York Times for 25 years and now writes for the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, told me in my latest online video, \"The real war on science is the one from the left.\" Really? Conservatives are more likely to be creationists -- denying evolution. \"Right,\" says Tierney. \"But creationism doesn't affect the way science is done.\" What about President George W. Bush banning government funding of stem cell research? \"He didn't stop stem cell research,\" Tierney reminds me. \"The government wouldn't fund it. It turned out that it really didn't matter much.\" Private funding continued and, so far, has not discovered much. \"People talk about this Republican war on science, but if you look around, my question is, where are the casualties? What scientists lost their jobs?\" asks Tierney. \"I can't find examples where the right wing stopped the progress of science, whereas you can look on the left and you see so many areas that are taboo to research.\" Some research on genetically modified foods became taboo because of protests from the left. That may have prevented a second Green Revolution to feed Africa. Scientists can't even talk about whether genes affect intelligence without being threatened by the left. Political scientists who continued to investigate the topic are screamed at on college campuses, the way Charles Murray, author of \"The Bell Curve,\" has been. Tierney adds, \"The federal government stopped funding IQ research decades ago.\" Likewise, researching gender differences is dangerous to your career. \"You can't talk about sexual differences between men and women, (although) it's OK if they favor women,\" laughs Tierney. \"You can say men are more likely to commit crimes, but you can't suggest that there might be some sexual difference that might predispose men to be more interested in a topic.\" Google fired engineer James Damore merely for suggesting that sex differences might explain why more men choose to work in tech. \"Damore just pointed out very basic scientific research about differences between the sexes,\" argues Tierney. \"The experts in this, as soon as he published that memo, said, yes, he basically got the science right.\" It's not as if women aren't doing well in life, says Tierney. In universities, \"women dominate virtually every extracurricular activity, but all the focus has been: 'Why aren't there more women physicists and mathematicians, and of course in the sports area, too?'\" says Tierney. \"There's this idea that they're being discriminated against, (but) there have been enormous studies of who gets grants, who gets tenure, who gets interviews for jobs, and women get preference.\" However, one group does get discriminated against in colleges: conservatives. \"In the social sciences, Democrats outnumber Republicans by at least eight to one. In fields like sociology it's 44 to one. Students are more likely to be taught in sociology by a Marxist than by a Republican,\" says Tierney. \"It's gotten worse and worse.\" Why does this happen at colleges that claim they \"treasure diversity\"? Because people on the left believe diversity just means race and gender, not thought. And even schools that want some diverse thought reach a sort of political tipping point. \"Once an academic department gets a majority of people who are on the left, they start hiring people like themselves, and soon the whole department is that way,\" says Tierney. \"They start to think that their opinions and that their interests are not only the norm, but the truth.\" That's how we get \"scientific\" studies that \"prove\" conservatives are stupid. One such study asked people if they agree with the statement \"Earth has plenty of natural resources if we just learn how to develop them.\" The researcher called a \"yes\" answer an \"irrational denial of science.\" But anyone who's studied economics knows the statement has repeatedly been proven true. Finally, millions of people die of malaria today partly because many countries believed leftist junk science and needlessly banned DDT. Many were influenced by Rachel Carson's scientifically challenged book \"Silent Spring.\" There is a war on science. But most of it doesn't come from the right. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "I disagree with those conservatives who say they will never, ever, ever, ever vote for Donald Trump should the GOP embrace his special brand of nonsense and nominate him, but I can’t blame them. Hell, I’m about one more round of foolishness away from joining them. But not quite yet. Trump is the lesser of the candidates, lesser of the conservatives, but also the lesser of the two ancient socialist evils that the Democrats are eenie meenie miney moeing between. At least Trump pretends to embrace capitalism, of a sort. And at least he doesn’t seem to hate America, just those Americans who aren’t awed by his magnificence. He’s no conservative, that’s clear. Trump merely mouths conservative ideas, though to characterize them as “ideas” gives them credit for a thoughtfulness and ideological rigor entirely absent from his experience. But Trump is canny enough to know his audience, and he knows what sells –God, guns, and the glory of the good old U.S. of A. And I like all those things. Perhaps he will continue to find supporting those things useful in the future, meaning that with Trump, at least there’s a chance we’ll be able to protect these things. But Der Crusty Commissar and the Bar-exam-flunking, pervert-enabling, pantsuited, liberal fascist harridan are actively against those things and everything else good about America. So Trump is marginally better only because he’s marginally less likely to turn us into a less tropical version of Venezuela. Yippee. Can you feel the burn? It goes without saying that the establishment burned us good by ignoring, when not actively lying to, the same folks Trump has now enlisted. Sure, Trump has attracted some cretins, racists and nimrods, though I’ll put his bad apple creepy hangers-on up against Sanders’s Occupier freaks any day in a Battle of the Political Fringies for the Worst People Ever trophy. But most of his followers are just regular Americans who are tired of seeing the country they spent their lives building, feeding, defending, and loving stolen from them by weirdos, losers and gender-fluid mutations. They are sick of being told what to do, what to think and what to feel – and to shut-up. It’s not only by the left but by our own side – how many conversations have you heard where those folks who didn’t get fancy degrees and who don’t work in a nice, clean office get derided as extras from Deliverance? Trump is their response. Trump is their champion. Trump is their avenger. But to understand Trump’s appeal is not to excuse him. He’s as faithful to conservative principles as Bill is to Hillary, and when President Trump rethinks everything he has said during the campaign after moving into the soon-to-be-fabulous White House, his followers stand a fair chance of finding that they are now the blue dress. Still, my assessment is that if he is nominated (which I think is no done deal for several reasons, like his pummeling in the recent debate) we are slightly better off with him than with one of the Dems – and his huge margins among women and Hispanics throw shade on the hope-over-experience notion that Trump can’t beat Hillary. I think he’ll beat her like a drum, and the amusement value of this bizarrely-coiffed charlatan driving the brownshirted liberal church lady nuts would almost be worth the risk to our Republic. But those who assess the danger of a President Trump as too great, well, you’ll get no argument from me. In 2012, I undertook the thankless task of trying to convince rabid libertarians that they were better off voting for Romney than remaining pure and in their basements. I was convinced I was right, and I was, in fact, right. But don’t look for me to chide my principled conservative friends like Rick Wilson and Erick Erickson when they sit out Election Day. This is a strategic disagreement, and I can’t say their strategy is too far off to be valid. Trump is not a conservative, and that’s reason enough to shun him. Trump has the potential to be a disaster of epic proportions. I’d vote for him as the nominee only because neither of the Democrats has the potential not to be. But if that’s not enough for you to support him, well, I won’t tell you you’re wrong. And besides, if he’s nominated, I’ll be too busy stockpiling food and fortifying my rural apocalypse compound to try to convince you otherwise. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/Alex Brandon President Trump's reelection campaign launched its \"Veterans for Trump\" coalition in November, which is tasked with reaching out to the country's military veterans and ensuring they vote for the current commander-in-chief. With around 20 million veterans in the U.S., Trump likes to tout his strong support with the voting bloc. In a July 2019 Pew Research poll, prior to the pullout of U.S. military personnel in northern Syria, 57 percent of American veterans said they approve of how Trump was doing as commander-in-chief. Forty-eight percent of veterans further said they believe his policies have made the military stronger. Jessie Jane Duff, a 20 year Marine Corps veteran who is now a co-chair on the \"Veterans for Trump\" board, told  she had worked with Concerned Veterans when the Department of Veterans Affairs waiting list scandal broke in 2014. Since then, Duff says she has seen the difference Trump's administration has brought to the VA. Some of the most crucial pieces of veteran legislation Trump signed into law include the 2017 VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which makes it easier to fire poor-performing VA employees, and the VA Mission Act of 2018, which increases private health care access for veterans. \"Essentially, there was no way to get rid of them...Under this administration, and we did work a lot on this with the last administration, but we couldn't make any headway, we finally got...a president to get this through Congress and...they are finally now holding employees accountable,\" Duff said. Similar to what the Pew poll found, Duff said Trump's priority of rebuilding the military through increasing its budget is another reason why veterans should vote for him again. Trump has also pushed for a 3.1% pay increase for the military, which was included in a continuing resolution the House approved in November. \"The Army and Marines were graded as 'weak' under President Obama. We now have them up to 'marginal' because it takes us years to rebuild this,\" she said. \"If you're getting from 'weak' to 'marginal,' that's big steps.\" Duff was referring to the Heritage Foundation's annual \"Index Of U.S.Military Strength\" report. In its report for 2016, the Army was rated \"weak\" in two of its three categories, and the Marine Corps was \"weak\" in one of the categories. For 2020, the military's overall strength was rated as \"marginal.\" Veteran unemployment during Trump's presidency has also reached new lows. November's job report showed that while veteran unemployment increased from three percent to 3.4 percent since October, it is the 19th month in a row where veteran unemployment has been lower than the national rate, according to the Military Times. Critics often point to comments Trump made during the 2016 election about the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, and Trump's draft deferments as proof he does not care about veterans and the military at large. \"If you're a Gold Star Mom, Dad...as soon as you go public, you are now going to be subjected to criticism. Khan was not some innocent man minding his own business going through his day to day life. He spoke out against then-candidate Trump. He did it methodically, he did it willingly, and he did it on a public forum,\" Duff said, adding how she receives criticisms as well for speaking out. \"Everyone has a right to defend themselves,\" Duff continued, saying Trump is no different and that he won't go out of his way to criticize anyone unless they \"throw the first punch.\" What Trump says shouldn't really matter, Duff said, because of what he has accomplished for the community. \"All I got to say is if that's all you got, you have nothing, because I don't care what happened two years ago or thirty years ago at this point, because he has proven, beyond any measure of doubt, that he has supported veterans and the military above and beyond. No other president has the record he has when it comes to the military and veterans,\" she said. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

The second, abuse of power. “Today in service to our duty to the Constitution and our country, the House committee introduces two articles impeachment charging Donald Trump with committing high crimes and misdemeanors,” Nadler said. .@RepAdamSchiff: Impeachment \"is an extraordinary remedy and one that I've been reluctant to recommend until the actions of President Trump gave Congress no alternative.\" pic.twitter.com/wGw7p6UYPj Democrats claim the abuse of power stems from President Trump’s July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine about corruption investigations. The obstruction charge, they argue, is justified due to the White House blocking witnesses from testifying. Keep in mind Schiff and Nadler could have gone to the courts to compel witnesses and in a rush to impeach, refused. “The President used the power of his office against a foreign country to corrupt our upcoming elections. He is a continuing threat to our democracy and national security. At 9 am ET, the House will announce our intent to #DefendOurDemocracy,” Pelosi tweeted earlier in the day. During the announcement, Nadler also laid out a timeline. The Judiciary Committee will vote by the end of the week on the charges and send them to the House floor for a full vote before Christmas. From there, if enough Democrats vote to pass it, the charges will go to the Senate for a full trial. Meanwhile, Republicans are responding. With this disgusting impeachment charade, House Democrats have proven themselves guilty of Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress. And moderate Democrats appear to be hedging: Rep. Collin Peterson, who was one of two Ds to vote against formalizing the impeachment procedures, told me this when asked if he’d vote against all articles: “I’m certainly leaning that way....I just think it will be too divisive for the country - it doesn’t accomplish anything” This story has been updated with additional information. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "There are all sorts of time bombs embedded within Obamacare. Will we force doctors to treat the millions of new Medicaid patients who are signing up for services that can be only partially reimbursed? How exactly will the IRS collect penalties from millions of off-the-books youth who choose not to buy coverage? For those who chose not to buy health insurance in the past, will these newly insured really follow through their initial signups with steady monthly premium payments? If not, how will we collect what they owe? Will all those who lost their coverage have enough money to buy the costlier Obamacare replacement plan? Among these unanswered questions, the most disturbing pertains to the demand that millions of so-called millennials under 30 must purchase health insurance -- estimated at about $1,700 a year -- that they will hardly use. Their premiums supposedly will subsidize older, in-need Americans who cannot pay the full costs of coverage that they will draw on frequently. We forget that young people are already targeted for a number of government redistribution plans. Of America's age cohorts, the under-30 bunch is the least likely to be employed, and the most likely to work at low-wage or part-time jobs. Millennials already pay high payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare coverage for the elderly. Yet most economists predict that both programs will soon prove insolvent and will not be able to extend the present level of benefits to young contributors when they retire. We are currently in the greatest economic slowdown since the Great Depression. The now normal 7 percent unemployment hits the young especially hard. Their jobless rate typically ranges from two to three times higher than the national average. Requiring employers to provide Obamacare coverage will spike unemployment and again do the most harm to those first entering the workforce. Young people in America owe in aggregate about $1 trillion in unpaid student loans. While in theory some of their interest rates are subsidized, many are not and range from 5 percent to 9 percent at a time when mortgages can still be had for about 4 percent. Universities consistently upped their tuition costs at a rate higher than inflation. They assumed that young people could always borrow more money each year to subsidize a mostly unaccountable institution. The curricula of far too many universities does not inculcate enough math and language skills. Young people did not dream up the race, class and gender industry that often crowds out skills-based classes and substitutes therapeutic \"studies\" courses. At a time when students need traditional general education more than ever, colleges are turning out graduates with costly degrees, obtained on borrowed money, that employers do not equate with broadly educated job applicants. Obamacare will not, as the president promised, \"lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.\" Most estimates suggest that the Affordable Care Act will add trillions to the already huge national debt. The current $17 trillion aggregate debt is largely a result of out-of-control entitlement obligations that skyrocketed the last 20 years and largely were paid out to those over the age of 30. When interest rates creep up, the cost of servicing the national debt may claim one-third of the yearly federal budget. The millennial generation will come of age to pay higher taxes and receive fewer government services to cover for prior generations who wanted more things on credit billed to their grandchildren. It is often easy to caricature the young. Today's youth see expensive iPhones and iPads as necessary as a prior generation's cheap pencils and pens. Some younger people wear sneakers and shades that cost more than three months of health care premiums. Suburban kids are as likely to be playing video games on weekend mornings as cutting the grass and raking leaves. All that said, the aging '60s generation has far more to answer for. We are handing over a very different America to our young people. They have received a worse education than did prior generations at a far greater cost in mostly borrowed money. There are fewer job opportunities and higher taxes. Others ran up the huge debt; young people will largely pay for it over the next half-century. Early marriage and child-raising, a nice house, two cars and pay-as-you-go college for the kids are all becoming a fantasy of a bygone generation. Professors talked mellifluously about trendy green issues, gay rights and abortion without ever explaining that those lectures came at high financial costs. \"Hope and change\" benevolent government sounded great to the young and idealistic. What was left out was that a captivated cohort was taken for granted and thereby seen as an easy mark to pay for it. In short, young people have been had. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Source: Screenshot via Fox 9 Former Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin, the man allegedly responsible for killing George Floyd by pressing his knee into Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, posted $1 million bail on Wednesday. According to the Associated Press, Chauvin was released from the Oak Park Heights facility around 11:30 a.m. local time. Under Chauvin's condition of release, \"he must attend all court appearances, cannot have any direct or indirect contact — including social media contact — with any members of Floyd’s family, cannot work in law enforcement or security, and must not possess any firearms or ammunition,\" WRBC-TV reported. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had to deploy 100 National Guardsmen in anticipation of rioting and unrest as the news came down. He also had equipment and facilities sent out in an \"abundance of caution.\"In addition, the governor also mobilized 100 Minnesota state troopers and 25 Department of Natural Resources conservation officers to assist the National Guard. Floyd's family was upset with the news. “It’s something that I’m not happy with. I’m not pleased with it. But I know I have to accept it because this is what the judge allowed to happen. ... I know our family is not happy with this decision,” Floyd's aunt, Angela Harrelson, told WRBC-TV. Where Chauvin got the money for the bond remains unclear (via AP): It was not immediately clear where Chauvin got the money to pay his bond. In Minnesota, someone who posts bond is required to pay 10%, in this case $100,000, to the bail bond company. Then, the company and the defendant work out an arrangement for collateral to back all or part of the rest of the bond amount, said Mike Brandt, a criminal defense attorney who is not connected to the case. A message left with the company that posted the bond, Allegheny Casualty Company, was not immediately returned. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, which has a legal defense fund, did not provide any money for bail, a spokeswoman said. Bob Kroll, president of the Minneapolis Police Officers Federation, said his union was not involved. The website GiveSendGo.com, which says it is a free Christian crowdfunding site, has a Derek Chauvin Bail Fund that says it was created by his family. According to the site, as of midday Wednesday that fund raised $4,198 of its $125,000 goal, with donations from more than 35 people. A posting on the site dated Sept. 12 said it took time to set up a fundraising effort due to the high-profile nature of the case. As of now, Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the case are scheduled to appear in court together in March. The judge overseeing the case is contemplating whether or not to allow each of the officers to stand trial alone. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "The French government is one step closer to criminalizing websites that “exert psychological or moral pressure” on pregnant women to not have an abortion. The “digital interference” bill, which was passed by the French National Assembly, will now go to the senate for approval before becoming law. According to Women’s Minister Laurence Rossignol, the bill isn’t meant to silence the pro-life position, but to stop websites that appear neutral from “manipulating people.” France legalised abortion more than 40 years ago and already has a law that makes it a criminal offence to intimate or pressure a woman in order to stop her terminating a pregnancy. This law was initially aimed at anti-abortion protesters in the 1980s who tried to physically obstruct women from accessing clinics or advice centres, and was later extended to anyone exerting moral or psychological pressure on women. The government now wants to extend the law further to include websites, claiming that the anti-abortion battle that used to take place outside clinics has now moved online. “Everyone is free to affirm their hostility to abortion online or anywhere else, but on condition of doing it in all honesty, because freedom of expression can’t be confused with manipulating people,” Rossignol told members of Parliament. “Thirty years ago, campaigners chained themselves to the gates of family planning clinics or operating tables to stop women accessing terminations. Today the next generation continues this battle online.” If passed, breaking the law could mean two years in prison and a fine up to 30,000 Euro (roughly $32,000). Conservative members of Parliament vowed to do all they could to stop the legislation. The proposals are “dangerous for democracy and probably anti-constitutional,” Republican MP Dominique Tian said.

        "articles": "Sure, she’s always been a little nutty, but over the years House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has gradually shifted from liberal feminist icon to everyone’s batty “a little bit out of it” aunt who knows just enough words-about-political-stuff to be dangerous. So in the spirit of hoping Pelosi is still up for fighting for her old speaker’s gavel come November, here are the seven craziest things Nutty Nancy has said in 2018 alone. (Why just this year, you ask? Because I only have one column, not a book!) “A nuclear bomb in your pocket.” Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday that it “pays to have a nuclear bomb in your pocket” when negotiating with President Trump, apparently referring to his recently smashingly successful summit with North Korea Kim Jong Un. “So, again, we all hope and pray that diplomacy works, for sure,” Pelosi stammered. “But this is deadly serious. And I guess the one thing I would say is they — they complained about the Iran agreement. And they have what? You know they come home with this and say, ‘Oh, it’s all over.’ But I’ll tell you this, it’s a real lesson to any country, if you’re going to negotiate with Donald Trump it pays to have a nuclear bomb in your pocket, because that is what will increase your negotiating power.” Um, what? The rest of the statement is just as illegible, a sentiment shared by many including Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro, who tweeted, “It’s time for this woman to call it a day and go home.” But Pelosi isn’t likely to go gently into that San Francisco night. No, she has designs on getting that speaker’s gavel back, even if it costs her party the midterms. “Hip hip horay, unemployment is down. What does that mean to me in my life?” Yeah, this one was so crazy even Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a flabbergasted, “She actually said that.” Here’s the quote: “Unless we have a very significant increase in wages and bigger paychecks, we are going to increase the frustration of America’s families because they’ll be saying, ‘Hip hip hooray, unemployment is down. What does that mean to me in my life? I need a bigger paycheck.' That’s the apprehension American families have had for a while.” “Doggie doo” When asked in January about the Republican plan for short-term CHIP funding, Pelosi compared it to … eating doggy poop. No, I’m not kidding. “This is like giving you a bowl of doggie doo, put a cherry on top and call it a chocolate sundae,” said Pelosi. “This is nothing.” A creative comparison to be sure, from a woman who regularly looks like she’s just tasted the stuff. The “spark of divinity” in MS-13 members Who could possibly forget this gem from last month in response to Trump’s “animals” characterization of MS-13. “Some of us who are attracted to the political arena, to government and public service” believe that “we are all God’s children” and “there is a spark of divinity among every person on earth, and we all have to recognize that as we respect the dignity and worth of every person,” said Pelosi, insisting that since we have “divinity in us” we need to recognize the same in MS-13 members, or something. “So when the president of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, ‘These aren’t people, these are animals,’ you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person?” Hey Nancy, how about you put your money where your mouth is and hire a few of these “divinity” sparked MS-13 angels to help you around your mansion when you retire? Speaking of divinity… The “hypocrisy” of people of faith for agreeing with immigration law enforcement Remember that time, just last week, when Holier-Than-Thou-Pelosi tried to criticize Attorney General Sessions and other people of faith as hypocrites for wanting law and order at the border? “The very hypocrisy of the Attorney General to quote the Bible, the hypocrisy of all people of faith in our country not to clamor for what the administration is doing to end — whether it’s to deprive the dreamers of the respect they deserve or whether its taking babies away from their mothers and fathers,” said Pelosi. “For this administration to pose as people of faith and pose as people who care about family and children is of a height of hypocrisy that knows no bounds.” First of all, for a liberal Dem like Pelosi to even think of bringing up faith and Christianity as a bludgeon is pretty hilarious on its face. Not to be all judgy, but this woman wouldn’t know a Christian from a Hare Krishna. How about the unborn, Friar Nancy? Do they deserve protection too? How about the criminal victims of illegal aliens? How about simply obeying the law? So, we’re to believe Nancy doesn’t believe in any parents of minors going to jail or prison, no matter what they do? Uh, nevermind, don’t answer that... “Strong employment numbers mean little…” “May’s jobs report shows that strong employment numbers mean little to the families hit with soaring new costs under the Republicans’ watch,” Pelosi wrote in a statement early this month, referring to the strongest job numbers yet under the Trump administration. Put it this way, if every person in America had a mansion and a $100,000 per year job, Pelosi and other liberals would STILL complain about it if it happened under President Trump. Seriously, does anyone in their right mind honestly think this woman wants what’s best for this country? “Crumbs…” Ah, the ubiquitous “crumbs” comment. You thought I was going to forget that one didn’t you? Nope, I didn’t forget, and hopefully millions of midterm voters won’t either. Unless, of course, you want Madame Let-Them-Eat-Cake to be third in line for the presidency come January 2019. “In terms of the bonus that corporate America receives versus the crumbs they are giving to workers to put the schmooze on is so pathetic,” Pelosi said in January, referring to news reports about employees getting bonuses as a result of recent GOP tax cuts. “And I would hope with their big advantage of bringing home at a very low rate that they would invest in infrastructure but our experience has been they will seek dividends and buy-backs. It is insignificant.” Later, she doubled down: “There’s a little mouse trap who’s got a little piece of cheese on there and there’s a mouse about to take it and that’s called the middle class. And around it are fat cats, they look a lot like elephants but anyway, around there. And that’s the thing. Get this little thing and we get this big bonanza. You get the crumb, we get the banquet.” Thing is, Nancy Fancy Pants, $1,000 may be chump change to you, but it means a hell of a lot to those of us who work for a living. But keep talking, and we’ll keep mobilizing the vote. The New York Times reports that “growing numbers of Democratic candidates” are beginning to see Pelosi as “politically toxic” and are “pledging to vote against her as their leader.” For the country’s sake, let’s hope the Democratic wing-nut wing prevails on this one. As hapless as some in our own party tend to be, we’re going to need all the help we can get! .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "A prominent Democratic politician who was banned from receiving federal aid three years ago over fraud charges is once again raking in government funds from the very same program he abused. It pays to be a FOTO -- Friend of the Obamas. Our publicly subsidized con artist is Sacramento mayor and former NBA star Kevin Johnson. He donated the maximum individual amount to Obama for America, campaigned across the country for Obama in 2008, and bragged to California media during his mayoral run about his friendship and access to both Barack and Michelle Obama. The Obama administration's Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) recently bestowed Johnson's city with an AmeriCorps grant worth more than $650,000. The money will flow into Sacramento's \"Get Fit Now! Initiative,\" which will hire 124 AmeriCorps members \"to teach fitness and nutrition education to children and offer adult fitness classes for their parents. They will also set up school-based gardens where children will learn how to grow fresh vegetables.\" That's a lot of fertilizer-shovelers employed in the name of \"public service.\" If the award smells funny, it should. For Johnson, AmeriCorps has indeed been all about service -- self-service, that is. In 2008, the independent Inspector General overseeing AmeriCorps, Gerald Walpin, concluded that Johnson and aide Dana Gonzalez had squandered hundreds of thousands of a nearly million-dollar grant earmarked for his nonprofit youth organization, St. HOPE. Based on Walpin's investigation, AmeriCorps' parent organization (the aforementioned CNCS) suspended Johnson and Gonzalez's access to federal funds. Here's a refresher on their fraud and abuse that led to the ban: -- Using AmeriCorps members to \"recruit students for St. HOPE Academy.\" -- Using AmeriCorps members for political activities in connection with the \"Sacramento Board of Education election.\" -- Assigning grant-funded AmeriCorps members to perform services for Johnson such as \"driving (him) to personal appointments, washing (his) car, and running personal errands.\" -- Improperly using AmeriCorps \"members to perform non-AmeriCorps clerical and other services\" that \"were outside the scope of the grant and therefore were impermissible\" for \"the benefit of St. HOPE.\" Johnson didn't get jail time. Instead, the Democratic U.S. Attorney in Sacramento cut a cozy settlement deal so Johnson could avoid criminal prosecution. The deal also allowed Johnson to repay just a fraction of the money he siphoned from AmeriCorps coffers for personal gain -- and it freed Johnson to receive federal Obama stimulus money for Sacramento. (My most recent check of the Recovery.gov website shows the city has taken in at least $32 million in stimulus cash.) In keeping with this administration's brutal war on whistleblowers, Walpin was unceremoniously fired and smeared by Team Obama. The White House baselessly questioned the veteran watchdog's mental health and accused him of political interference. The first lady then installed her former chief of staff, Jackie Norris, in AmeriCorps' top management to ensure -- in Mrs. Obama's own words -- that they remained the program's \"No. 1 cheerleaders.\" Even more troubling, Johnson continues to reap government tax dollars for youth programs while he remains dogged by questions about his predatory behavior with teenage girls. A little-noticed section of the joint November 2009 report by GOP Sen. Charles Grassley and GOP Rep. Darrell Issa on Walpin's firing revealed that the AmeriCorps inspector general's investigator \"became aware of allegations of inappropriate contact between Johnson and three female St. HOPE students.\" Their stories mirror a similar incident involving Johnson (then 29 and playing for the Phoenix Suns) and a 16-year-old girl dating back to 1995. Johnson's attorney, Kevin Hiestand, approached at least one of the St. HOPE students describing himself only as \"'a friend of Johnson's,'\" and \"basically asked me to keep quiet,\" according to the student. She had complained to St. HOPE officials that Johnson groped her sexually after instructing her to grade papers with him in her apartment. The report also highlighted what clearly looks like a hush-money and witness-tampering attempt: \"According to her interview with OIG investigators, about one week later, Kevin Johnson offered her $1,000 a month until the end of the program, which she refused to accept.\" Erik Jones, a teacher at St. HOPE, reported to the police that one of his students told him Johnson \"started massaging her shoulders and then reached over and touched her breasts.\" Jones quit his job in protest over the seeming cover-up of Johnson's harassment and wrote in his resignation letter that \"St. HOPE sought to intimidate the student through an illegal interrogation and even had the audacity to ask me to change my story.\" Another student recounted for investigators how Johnson \"kissed her cheek, brushed up against her\" and touched her thigh on various occasions -- as well as flipping up her skirt on a St. HOPE-sponsored trip to Harlem. She didn't report the incidents to AmeriCorps officials at the time because she \"feared she would be terminated.\" Another St. HOPE official, Jacqueline Wong-Hernandez, also left Johnson's nonprofit over the whitewash. Michelle Rhee, Johnson's fiancee and former D.C. schools chief, was a St. HOPE board member at the time. The Grassley-Issa report noted, \"According to Wong-Hernandez, Rhee learned of the allegations and played the role of a fixer, doing 'damage control'\" and vouching for Johnson's character. He's a \"good guy,\" Rhee told Walpin. Taxpayers -- and especially parents of teenage girls and AmeriCorps workers in Sacramento schools -- should beg to differ. Johnson didn't get jail time.

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) called out Speaker Pelosi’s histrionics surrounding COVID stimulus, after Democrats blocked the GOP-proposed package twice this week. Speaker Pelosi suggests that Leader McConnell is the legislator acting as the road-block for COVID relief, but the GOP leader set the record straight. “What I put on the floor this week was a bill we all agreed on. She [Speaker Pelosi] just wants to spend way more,” Leader McConnell said on The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino. “Actually, the bill I put on the floor is $500 billion, half a trillion dollars, and she calls that a skinny bill. She’s been promoting a massive expenditure, much of it unrelated to the problem...tax cuts for rich people in New York and California, free healthcare for illegal immigrants...from a Kentucky point of view, there’s more money in there for Puerto Rico than Kentucky. That’s not a serious effort to legislate. What I wanted to do was focus on the problem and get as much relief to the American people, as fast as we could.” While Leader McConnell fights for relief for Americans in need, his Democrat opponent who launched a long-shot bid to unseat him sides with Democratic leadership as they hold stimulus hostage. She echoes the talking points pushed by her party bosses, but has yet to acknowledge that her party filibustered relief for Americans in need, after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) attempted to adjourn the Senate until after the election before relief could be passed. The Republican candidate for Kentucky's U.S. Senate seat answers questions about the Senate's coronavirus relief efforts. #KYSEN pic.twitter.com/LTWilP3RfI The $500 billion relief package that Democrats filibustered included $16 billion for coronavirus testing, $105 billion for schools, $31 billion for vaccine creation and $15 billion for child care, among other COVID-related relief funds. The passage of additional relief before the November 3 election is unlikely.

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/Patrick Semansky President Joe Biden's original nominee for director of the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, pulled her nomination after it was revealed that she made a number of salacious remarks about Republican lawmakers. The person poised to take Tanden's spot is Shalanda Young, who was originally picked as the nominee for the OMB deputy director position. As it turns out, Young also has a questionable (recent) past. While Young's nomination for the deputy director position originally received little scrutiny and mostly bipartisan support, members of Congress are looking closer into her past. A statement she made on the Hyde Amendment, which prevents taxpayer funds from being used for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother's life, is what caused a number of Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security and the Budget Committees to vote against her nomination. According to Young, women need to have access to abortion because it's considered \"a matter of economic and racial justice.\" “The President has spoken in favor of Congress ending the Hyde Amendment as part of his commitment to providing comprehensive health care for all women,\" Young wrote in her written answer about the Hyde Amendment. \"Further, eliminating the Hyde Amendment is a matter of economic and racial justice because it most significantly impacts Medicaid recipients, who are low-income and more likely to be women of color.” Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member, Rob Portman (R-OH), previously supported Young's position for deputy director until he learned about her stance on the Hyde Amendment. \"This is one where our country is so deeply divided on abortion, where we've been able to come together and decide, at a minimum, let's not tell people with a deep view based on their conscience on this, that they have to pay taxpayer funds for abortion,\" Portman explained. Senate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters (D-MN) said he is confused about Republicans' decision to change their mind on Young's nomination. “In her written responses, Ms. Young stated that ending the Hyde amendment is a matter of economic and racial justice because its impact is felt most among low-income women of color. This is simply a statement of fact,” Peters told Roll Call. “But she also confirmed that she will follow current law, which includes the Hyde amendment. So I have a hard time following the objections of my Republican colleagues.” Three Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee did vote in favor of Young's nomination: Sens. Lindsey Graham (SC), Chuck Grassley (IA) and Kevin Cramer (ND). Young's nomination will now go to the full Senate for a vote. If confirmed as deputy director, she will serve as acting director. White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said Young is a \"very serious candidate\" for the director position, although Biden has yet to make a final decision. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

It drew condemnation from world leaders. In truth, this move was probably already in the works. These folks were not really secretive about it. They were just waiting for Trump to leave office. The Capitol Hill riot on January 6 changed all of that and gave these tech companies a reason to purge scores of conservatives from their platforms. It was probably going to be a slow bleed. Now, they had casus belli to wage war as they pleased and in full view of the public under the guise of doing a public service or something. It was censorship. There’s no way around it and conservative media is and remains in the crosshairs. So, after weeks of press releases from the Office of the Former President, Trump intends to communicate with his base through a new blog. Reportedly, you cannot comment or interact with Trump, but at least he’ll be on a platform where we can get daily posts from the leader of the Republican Party. JUST IN - Trump launches a blog where he can post text, photos, and videos. However, visitors cannot leave comments or otherwise engage with his posts.

        "articles": "Here's Connecticut's former Attorney General, phony Vietnam war veteran, and senior US Senator tacitly admitting the obvious: \"How would anything in the bill, as it currently stands, have stopped anything that went on in Newtown?” Crowley asked. “The majority leader has assured me and other proponents of these measures that we can offer amendments on both the assault-weapons ban and the prohibition on high-capacity magazines, so there will be both,” Blumenthal responded, adding that he intends to offer an amendment that would ban high-capacity magazines. He's not suggesting Democrats scrap their inefficacious bill, of course; he's making the case that it must go further, thus underscoring the nasty schism opening up on the Left over guns. On one hand, you have President Obama demagoguing gun control critics as callous monsters who've \"forgotten\" the children of Sandy Hook. On the other, you have Harry Reid (with a lifetime 'B' rating from the NRA in his back pocket) effectively scotching Diane Feinstein's assault weapons ban because it couldn't even garner 40 votes in his Democrat-held chamber. Blumenthal says Reid is promising to allow amendment votes on whatever watered-down bill eventually emerges -- the details of which seem very much in flux. This would allow blue state Dems to vote for more stringent restrictions, but when red and purple state Democrats line up to vote against these added measures, will the president harangue them for abandoning The Children? Will the party's left-wing base move to punish their wayward members? Will Mike Bloomberg drop a few million to boost gun-grabbier primary challengers? As you give those a think, let's return to Candy Crowley's trenchant question, which Blumenthal ducked: \"How would anything in the bill, as it currently stands, have stopped anything that went on in Newtown?\" I'll even expand the premise to cover a bill that includes both an assault weapons ban modeled after the expired 1994 federal law and some form of high capacity magazine prohibition. It seems to me that the only honest answer to Crowley's query would still be, \"absolutely nothing, Candy.\" Why? (1) Background checks - The Newtown shooter stole his weapons from his mother, who bought them legally. There is no method for checking people who are determined to obtain a gun illegally. Furthermore, law enforcement already lacks the wherewithall to track down the vast majority of prospective gun buyers who flunk background checks. This isn't a Republican talking point; the Vice President has admitted as much himself. (2) \"Assault weapons\" ban - Connecticut has a federal-style ban in place. The weapons used in the Sandy Hook massacre were not proscribed by that law. (3) Magazine limits - Forcing a spree shooter to reload may provide an opening for unarmed victims to tackle him, which is how bystanders brought the Tucson horror to an end. The likelihood that defenseless, terrified little children would have the presence of mind, let alone the strength, to bull-rush a deranged gunman is essentially zero. (What a truly horrific sentence to have to write). I've written previously that I'm far from an absolutist on gun rights. After Newtown, I indulged the natural human impulse to \"do something,\" and still hold out hope that some successful and reasonable compromise may be forged. But piling new laws atop the current heap doesn't automatically qualify as a solution. Will proposed restrictions actually work? Are they duplicative? Are they unduly restrictive of law abiding citizens' Second Amendment rights? These questions must be seriously addressed, not glossed over by Blumenthal et al's specious and sophomoric \"if it saves one life...\" argument. Plenty of horrible, liberty-depriving, job-killing, unenforceable laws could conceivably save lives (banning cars, for instance, or setting a universal speed limit of 25 milies per hour). That cannot and must not be the standard, although it certainly sounds nice as a platitude on television. I'll leave you with a reminder of what happens when the \"do something\" mob rushes into hasty, ill-conceived action: Cuomo happens, replete with wholly unworkable prohibitions and glaring oversights -- like forgetting to exempt law enforcement officers from certain bans. This from the party that congratulates itself for being the champions of pragmatism, evidence and science. Parting quotation, via the nation's foremost gun safety expert: \"The Assault Weapons ban and the limitation on the size of magazines, let me say this as clearly as I can: this is just the beginning.\" .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

According to the atheist group, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the memorial violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause by placing a “permanent Catholic shrine on public land.” In the lower court ruling, Judge Dana Christensen validated the memorial’s presence for both its historical significance and for being accepted by many for non-religious purposes: For many, Christensen said, the statue is mostly “a historical reminder of those bygone days of sack lunches, ungroomed runs, rope tows, T-bars, leather ski boots and 210 cm. skis.” There is no reason the previous ruling should not stand.

        "articles": "Florida’s young Republican Senator Marco Rubio gave an important speech at the Reagan Presidential Library in California that has set off the liberal talking head universe. He had the temerity to suggest that the huge growth in government’s role in American life over the last century “actually weakened us as a people.” The resulting onslaught from liberal blogs and cable hosts comes as no surprise because Rubio directly took on the idol at which liberals worship – Big Government. But his analysis was courageous and profound. Eighty percent of Americans are not happy with the direction of the country. And, new Gallup polling shows that only 17 percent are positively disposed toward the federal government. Americans want answers. Senator Rubio, in this speech, stepped up to the plate to provide answers. If liberals disagree, they are going to have to get equally serious. They’ve certainly got to do better than MSNBC’s Ed Schultz, calling Rubio “a political hack” who wants “to get rid of social safety nets.” Our fiscal crisis is undeniable. The trillions in debt we’ve taken on to finance massive government spending has resulted in the unthinkable downgrading in rating of our government’s bonds. But Senator Rubio took a bold step beyond looking at our problems just as an accountant. He suggested that we cannot separate our budget from our culture. The culture of government has displaced the culture of personal responsibility. I have been making the point for years regarding what the welfare state culture has done in our black communities. How it has created a permanent underclass, defined by family breakdown, sexual promiscuity, disease, and crime. American culture has changed profoundly over these years that Americans have come to increasingly believe that government social engineering can solve life’s problems and challenges. A snapshot of today’s American family shows how much things have changed, even compared to 1981 when President Reagan took office. Since 1980, the percentage of babies in America born to unwed mothers has doubled, from 20 percent to 40 percent. Fifty two percent of Americans over the age of 18 are married today, compared to 72 percent in 1960. Among blacks, 44% of the population over 18 has never been married, compared to 17% in 1960. Sixty four percent of American children today live in a home with two married parents, compared with 75 percent in 1980 and 87 percent in 1960. And, according to the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of those between ages of 18 to 29 “agree marriage is becoming obsolete.” We used to be a nation, as Senator Rubio pointed out, where parents raised and cared for children, then those children cared for their aging parents. Where neighbors cared for neighbors. We might note that the welfare state idea is not an American invention but an import from Europe. We also might note that about 20 percent of Europeans attend church regularly, half that of Americans. Europe is characterized today by low birth rates – so low that they are not replacing themselves – and high unemployment rates. The unemployment rate in France has hovered between 8 and 11 percent over the last 25 years. We must wonder if even we can take on our fiscal problems, if traditional American family life can be restored, and if we believe it even matters. It is to Senator Rubio’s considerable credit that he has stood up to argue that we must look at the picture of our nation in its entirety. That we cannot separate our budget matters and our attitude toward government from our overall culture and our personal behavior. What is before us today is not a battle of competing numbers but a battle of competing visions. Is America to continue in the direction of welfare state materialism? Or will this be a free nation under God? .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

And then there's Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, John Bolton, just to name a few additional potential entrants. It's enough to make your head spin. Indeed, the only major rumored candidate who's explicitly ruled it out is Paul Ryan, who'll prefer to have his hands on Congress' purse strings for the next few years. Rob Portman might count in this category, too, but that's more of a stretch. Which brings us to one of the more polarizing conservative figures in the country.

At age 44, some have wondered if Cruz might take measure of the ever-expanding and power-packed 2016 field, recognize his relative youth and red state job security, and keep his power dry for a future Oval Office run. Evidently not. This looks like a man who's running for president (via David Drucker): Team Ted Cruz is taking shape, and the Senate first-termer's presidential campaign could start before this spring. The Republican senator from Texas tentatively plans to fill senior campaign positions with the triumvirate he signed last summer to expand his political operation. At the top is Jeff Roe, whose organizational title is undefined but who would be the campaign’s chief strategic and logistics decision-maker. Jason Miller would shape and oversee campaign messaging; Lauren Lofstrom would direct fundraising. Cruz is in the process of “feeling out” additional campaign hires and prospective donors in preparation to join the field of 2016 candidates. If the senator decides to run for president, he wants to hit the ground at full speed, a senior Cruz advisor confirmed Monday...Rounding out the team are pollster Chris Perkins, who earned plaudits for being among the few to correctly forecast November’s Georgia Senate race, and Jason Johnson, the senator’s longtime political consigliere. Nick Muzin, Cruz's deputy chief of staff in his Senate office, is steeped in South Carolina politics. He is viewed as someone who might take a leave of absence from Cruz' Senate office to join the campaign...“His early reviews among tea party audiences have been stellar in Iowa,” a Republican insider in the Hawkeye State told the Examiner. “I don't think he can appeal as broadly in the party or in the general electorate as other candidates, but his support will be intense among those voters who have the highest anger score.” Dan wrote up this week's CBS News poll of Republicans, which contains good news for Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush (quite possibly a product of name recognition at this early stage), and bad news for Chris Christie and Sarah Palin (both of whom generate far more \"don't run\" responses from members of their party). Several of the other prospective contenders are slightly above water on the run/don't run question -- Huckabee, Rubio, Walker, Carson -- while others are narrowly underwater: Paul, Perry, Jindal, Santorum…and Cruz, at (21/25). I'll leave you with Cruz making his case to a crowd of conservative activists in South Carolina. He decries the GOP's \"mushy middle,\" arguing that nominating another moderate guarantees another loss: This is a preview of how Cruz will handle questions about \"electability.\" It'll be welcomed by many conservatives, who are convinced that the party needs to be more conservative in order unleash the full power of the base, and win. This line of thinking runs the risk of ignoring a demographically shifting electorate, and it relies on the belief that millions of conservatives sat at home in 2012. The great Sean Trende runs the numbers and determines that it was more a case of millions of white voters staying home, many of whom did not fall easily into the \"conservative\" column. The GOP's demographic dilemma is real, even if it's exaggerated. Running hard to the right nationally may not reverse the party's fortunes, but Cruz appears poised to run on that advice, hoping that Republican voters will give him the chance to test his proposition. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Liberals lie not only because the truth repels them like work repels a Democrat but because they hope to force you into accepting their lie and therefore becoming complicit in their deceit. Lying is an exercise of power; every lie we allow to pass uncontested is a small victory for these cultural trolls. Time to troll them right back. Let’s start with the Texas clock kid lie. We all know that kid absolutely should have been confronted about his gadget, which would not have made it through a TSA checkpoint without a hundred government flunkies freaking out. Note that if there was an overreaction in locking him up, it was by other government flunkies – Barack Obama’s chosen people. This is why there should be many fewer of them. But instead of blaming the zero tolerance-loving quasi-fascists who uniformly vote for him and his ilk, Obama could not pass up on an opportunity to demonstrate his contempt for the American people. He jumped at the chance to call his fellow Americans hideous racists, but that’s a lie. Under the lie du jour, the alleged racist thought process must have been something along the lines of: “Okay, this kid brought a weird, wiry electronic device into our school. Luckily, no one ever tries to hurt schoolkids, and certainly no Muslim male has ever tried or succeeded at going on a killing spree in Texas that I can recall. Now, from my extensive explosive ordnance training at schoolteacher school, I can see that this bundle of wires and circuits is clearly a clock, but since this kid’s ancestors came from some Muslim country, I think I’ll falsely accuse him of crime and take all the inherent risks of making a false criminal accusation because my senseless hatred is so intense, even though it has never manifested before this moment. ‘Merica.” Hmmm. Sounds legit. Certainly more legit than, “I’m a not-to-bright government employee in an environment where freaks attack schools and this kid came in with a strange device and it got out of hand.” Yeah, with Homeland Security still telling us, “If you see something, say something,” Obama’s meeting with his DHS secretary must be super-awkward. Maybe DHS could change it’s admonition to, “If you see something, say something, unless it’s a Muslim doing the something, in which case you’re rolling the dice because if you’re wrong President Fail and his MSM transcriptionists will call you a racist.” In the aftermath, some people are saying this was a deliberate hoax by the family to create an incident, and if it was it succeeded better than they could have ever hoped thanks to Obama. Interestingly, you don’t have to be an Islamic mullah to fool Obama. Apparently, you can be a 14 year-old Muslim kid and make a fool out of him too. The lesson for us? Reject the lies. After this lie came out, hordes of lonely liberals took to social media sharing their hitherto unknown expertise in the detection of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), toeing the Obama line that this was further evidence of America’s grotesque racism. But we normals fought back. Memes went up comparing clock brat’s creation with real bombs. Folks posted photos of various jihadi freakshows where they paraded kids around dressed as suicide bombers. Vets commented on how the “clock” looked a lot like the bombs that blew off their limbs. And moms observed that their kids’ lives were significantly more important than the feelings of some urchin who walked into a classroom with a beeping box of electrical components that would get him tackled by the Secret Service if he brought it within a mile of the Oval Office. Oh, and folks started digging into the gadget itself, like how it was apparently merely a disassembled clock. Yah science! They also dug into the (Shocker!) activist history of the kid’s dad. Uh oh liberals, there goes your narrative. We have seen a lot of liberal lies lately, which is not surprising since they have nothing left, and we’ve offered powerful pushback that frustrates and annoys them. In fact, it annoys them so much that Robert Redford just made a movie about the start of the pushback to the Big Lies. In what is apparently his first foray into science fiction, Dan Rather’s bundle of letters about George W. Bush’s National Guard service were apparently generated by a modern Microsoft Word program that traveled back in time to the early 1970s. With regard to Hillary Clinton, you have her coterie of hacks piping up about how having classified material on your computer is no big deal and how everybody does it and blah blah blah. And in response, battalions of us who actually worked with classified material responded with truth – that anyone not useful to the Obama administration would be in an orange jumpsuit in about two seconds after doing one one-thousandth of what HRC indisputably did. Damn that internet and its ability to allow the truth to get past the Democrat steno pool that is the mainstream media! No wonder Hillary is making a central plank of her platform changing the Constitution to allow her to make it a crime to be critical of her. As a result of all this freedom of speech, her favorability ratings are plummeting. Clearly it must be stopped; it’s so serious that the Democrats are starting to think Joe Biden is the answer to their problems. But we aren’t going to stop. Conservatives released the videos of the butchers at Planned Parenthood doing exactly what we knew they were doing and the liberals freaked out. They particularly freaked out because Carly Fiorina used a CNN debate watched by 23 million Americans to talk about these sick, savage, baby-dismembering sociopaths. And their response was simply to lie – “None of the videos actually showed Planned Parenthood dismembering babies and selling off the parts!” Interestingly, their supporting argument is, “But there would be nothing wrong with Planned Parenthood dismembering babies and selling off the parts!” Liberals count on people not actually watching the videos, and the MSM has cooperated by pretending that the revelation that an organization subsidized by taxpayers to the tune of $500 million is dismembering babies and selling off the parts is a non-story and not reporting it. But thanks to alternative media, we conservatives can direct normal citizens to the key clips. (Note: As of three days after the debate, the front page of Carly’s poorly designed website does not have a link to the video clips she cited in her devastating debate soliloquy. As a CEO, this is where you start demanding your staff get off their rears and start performing.) Liberals have only lies and a complicit media. We have the truth and we now have the tools to fight for it. Every one of us – on social media, in personal interactions – needs to stop nodding along and start raising our voice. Troll them back with the truth. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "One of the great ironies of the gun control debate is that everyone who calls for gun control still wants a man with a gun protecting him. Every governor in America has armed security. You have to go through a metal detector guarded by men with guns to get into the Capitol building. Barack Obama has hundreds of Secret Service agents carrying fully automatic weapons who protect his safety. Even run-of-the-mill Democrats who want to take guns away from everyone else will unhesitatingly pick up the phone and call the police if they feel threatened -- so that a man with a gun can show up and make them safe. But, if a man in a bad neighborhood wants a gun to make his family safe, a rape victim wants a gun to be protected, or just the average Joe wants a gun in case his life is endangered by a burglar, thug or the next Adam Lanza, these same people want to take their guns away. Pro-gun control Democrats may think we have an \"upper class\" that deserves to be protected with guns while it's okay if the \"peons\" get shot, but that goes against the core of what America is supposed to be. If your child's life is in danger, you should have every bit as much of a right and opportunity to defend his life as the Secret Service does to defend the President of the United States when he's threatened. Unfortunately, there are some people in this country who apparently believe they're so special, so elite, so much better than the rest of the \"riff-raff,\" that they should have a right to be protected even if you don't. 1) The Journal-News: The Journal News printed \"the names and addresses of gun permit holders in Rockland and Westchester counties\" as its way of taking a dig at gun owners. But, this attitude about guns certainly did change when the shoe was on the other foot. Veritas video reporter James O’Keefe has released a new video of his team posing as an anti-gun group promoting an initiative to journalists. At each home, the group dubbed as “Citizens Against Senseless Violence” asks homeowners if they are willing to put up a “Gun Free” sign in their yard. O’Keefe primarily focuses his efforts on employees of the Journal-News – the New York newspaper that published a controversial map of registered gun owners online. Armed security welcomes the Veritas team at some of the homes - as some of the newspaper's employees felt threatened once bloggers retaliated by posting their names and addresses online. 2) Dianne Feinstein: She introduced the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 in the Senate. \"I know the sense of helplessness that people feel. I know the urge to arm yourself because that's what I did. I was trained in firearms. I walked to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon and I made the determination if somebody was going to try and take me out, I was going to take them with me.\" -- Dianne Feinstein 3) Mark Kelly, the husband of Former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ): \"Mark E. Kelly, gun-control proponent and husband to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, recently purchased an AR-15 (an “assault weapon,” he called it)—which he now says he intended as an illustration of the need for more stringent gun laws. Kelly reportedly bought the AR-15 and a 1911-style semi-automatic pistol at a gun store in Tucson, Arizona. Testifying to the Senate Judiciary Committee January 30, Kelly had urged senators to restrict sales of firearms based on their lethality–a common refrain with other witnesses that day who argued that semi-automatic weapons, which chamber subsequent rounds as bullets are fired, and other guns with military-style features, level the playing field against law enforcement. Kelly and Giffords founded their own advocacy group to restrict gun rights, Americans for Responsible Solutions, in January. ...Similarly, the ARS website says: “Congress should act to limit the sale of assault weapons.\" 4) Shania Twain: “Shania Twain didn't exactly have a shotgun wedding....in Puerto Rico ... but it sure was a pistol -- as in what the guards were packing on the beach during the ceremony,” TMZ.com reports. We’re told there were 'several armed security guards.' ...But here’s the thing about the privileged Ms. Twain employing armed guards (lawbreaking or otherwise) in the first place—she’s a big advocate of infringements against those of us who can’t afford an armed security presence and must rely on being our own first line of defense. She was one of the signers...of the Handgun Control, Inc. (since changed to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, to help mask their intentions) “Open Letter to the NRA,” a full page ad published in USA Today.\" 5) Rosie O'Donnell: \"On her television show, April 19, 1999,O’Donnell had this to say about gun owners: “I don’t care if you want to hunt. I don’t care if you think it’s your right. I say, ‘Sorry.’ It is 1999. We have had enough as a nation. You are not allowed to own a gun, and if you do own a gun I think you should go to prison.” Several months later, a bodyguard in her employ applied for a concealed gun permit from the Greenwich (Connecticut) Police Department. When queried about whether her bodyguard should carry a gun on May 24, 2000, she said, 'I don’t personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem.'\" 6) Sarah Brady: \"Gun-control advocate Sarah Brady bought her son a powerful rifle for Christmas...and may have skirted Delaware state background-check requirements, the Daily News has learned. Brady reveals in a new memoir that she bought James Brady Jr. a Remington. 30-06, complete with scope and safety lock, at a Lewes, Del., gun shop. \"I can't describe how I felt when I picked up that rifle, loaded it into my little car and drove home,\" she writes. \"It seemed so incredibly strange: Sarah Brady, of all people, packing heat. \"Brady became a household name as a crusader for stricter gun-control laws after her husband, James, then the White House press secretary, was seriously wounded in a 1981 assassination attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan.\" 7) Michael Moore: He's a staunch advocate of gun control who has gone so far as to suggest that merely owning a gun is racism, \"…But on this particular day, on Martin Luther King Day, I think this needs to be said.

        "articles": "The place was rocking. The energy inside the Mayo Civic Auditorium equaled that only found when the U of M Gophers play hockey against the UMD Bulldogs in Duluth. It’s an energy that cannot be fully explained, but you can actually feel it. The family sitting next to us had driven five hours from Brainerd. Another fellow had flown in from California, just to attend a political rally. But it wasn’t just a political rally. It was a cross between a religious tent revival and a rock concert. The attendees were a cross section of America. Sitting three rows in front of us was a very recognizable business leader wearing an expensive blue suit. Two community college students stood in line with us sporting much more modest student attire. Contrary to some media reports, the makeup of the audience matched the ethnic makeup of Southern Minnesota. There were a few protesters outside. But, they were dwarfed by the thousands of Trump supporters who couldn’t get in. When the President strode slowly to the podium, the roar was deafening. My wife and I weren’t alone in wishing we had brought ear plugs. He took the time to look and wave to every section in the hall, expressing his appreciation for their attendance. It was more than mutual. There was a TelePrompTer, but he didn’t need it. Both he and the audience knew what he was going to say. And they lapped it up like thick cream. There was the obligatory dig at the Fake News section. The crowd roared. He talked about his administration’s accomplishments in the last twenty months. There were many and each received thankful applause. He dropped the gloves and tore into the Democrats with bare knuckles. Sensing that he now had them against the boards over their embarrassing treatment of Judge Kavanaugh, he held nothing back. The crowd was in the palm of his hands. He called the Democrats the party of crime for their open borders plans. Their foolhardy policies would only guarantee more drugs and violent criminals coming into our neighborhoods. That hit a nerve here where the Democratic Candidate for Governor has called for making Minnesota into a Sanctuary State. Trump apparently knew it. The crowd fed off him and he off them. It was a spectacle to behold. So why would people travel long distances to stand in lines on a cold, rainy Minnesota evening to participate in a rally like this? To listen to a speech that they had pretty much heard before? The answer became clear watching the crowd dynamics that night. Donald J. Trump didn’t create his supporters. They found him. They had been looking for someone like him to come along for decades. And here he was, in the flesh. He was here in their area. They were not going to miss this for the world. It wasn’t so much to hear a speech, in reality it was their chance to say thank you. They were there to express their appreciation to someone who had the courage to speak up and fight for things they had wanted for a very long time. They had been ignored and maligned for years. Here was a man who didn’t need to take on the job. A man with a beautiful wife and family. He offered himself up to take on the great issues of our time. To absorb the withering fire from the angry Left. To spit in the eye of the name calling thought police. To shake things up and kick over some tables in the swamp. To say what needed to be said and do the things that had been swept under the rug for far too long. Here was their champion. The man who understands them. The man who has given them voice. Someone who at long last understood that a President’s job is to defend American interests first. People who have been waiting decades for such a man have no problem waiting for hours in the cold and damp. They know that he is imperfect. That he is not a particularly polished public speaker. The Left and their fellow travelers in the media will never understand the Trump phenomenon. Maybe that is a good thing. The Trump effect is real. Elections are about turnout, especially midterms. Energy drives turnout. As President Trump strides from one victory to the next, it’s hard to imagine that the energy manifested in that auditorium the other night will not translate into Republican victories November 6th.

        "articles": "Secretary of Defense James Mattis dispelled reports Tuesday that he was apprehensive about working with President Trump’s incoming National Security Advisor John Bolton. \"I'll tell you right up front, it's going to be a partnership, we are going to go forward,\" Mattis told reporters during a news conference at the Pentagon. When asked about his differing world views with Bolton, Mattis responded, \"I hope that there's some different world views. That's the normal thing you want unless you want group think.\" Mattis acknowledged that the two hadn’t met yet but said Bolton was coming to the Pentagon later this week for discussions. \"We are going to sit down together and I look forward to working with him,\" Mattis said. He emphasized that he had no reservations about Bolton’s appointment. \"No reservations, no concerns at all,” he said. “Last time I checked he's an American. I can work with an American, OK? So I'm not the least bit concerned with that sort of thing.\" Mattis and Bolton are likely to differ when it comes to the Iran deal. Mattis has advised President Trump to stay in the deal. Bolton, on the other hand, has repeatedly advocated for tearing up the agreement. Trump has a May 12 deadline for deciding whether the U.S. will leave the Iran deal or attempt to renegotiate it. Another apparent area of disagreement between the two is North Korea. Mattis has advocated for a diplomatic strategy with North Korea, but Bolton recently wrote an op-ed making a case for launching a preemptive strike on North Korea. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "After a series of scathing tweets from President Trump, the Mexican government has stopped a caravan of illegal aliens traveling through Mexico from Honduras and on their way to the United States. The caravan was organized by People Without Borders, a far left organization. From WAPO: The Mexican government on Monday evening moved to break up the caravan of migrants moving through southern Mexico, with immigration officials registering the travelers and suggesting some could receive humanitarian visas while others would have to leave Mexico.The caravan, estimated at more than 1,000 migrants, many from Central America, has gained increasing visibility because of tweets by President Trump that have criticized Mexico for not doing more to stop the flow of migrants to the southern border of the United States.An official from Mexico’s National Institute of Migration told BuzzFeed News that Mexico plans to disband the caravan by Wednesday and that some vulnerable people, such as pregnant women or those with disabilities, would receive humanitarian visas, while the rest will be expected to leave Mexico within 10 days or apply for permission to remain in Mexico for a month. During an interview with Fox News Monday night, Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Geronimo Gutierrez argued Mexico has a cooperative track record of stopping the flow of illegal aliens traveling through Mexico and into the United States. He also argued Mexico does not promote irregular immigration. \"Mexico's migration policy is to seek that any migration is legal, safe, orderly and respectful of basic human rights. That's the way we act upon immigration. We certainly do not argue for irregular immigration from our nationals or from any other country,\" Gutierrez said. \"Our authorities, U.S.-Mexico cooperation, is very good.\" \"What we're trying to do is to work with the United States and Central America,\" he continued. \"It is in our own interest to have a secure southern border and we're also in favor of having a secure border with the United States.\" .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Fourteen to one, in favor. That was the Los Angeles City Council vote to raise, over the next five years, the city's minimum wage from $9 an hour to $15. Of course, as Investor's Business Daily tells us, the $15 per hour really is closer to $20. How does it get to $20? Investor's Business Daily says: \"Once all the nonwage costs are added, including payroll taxes, paid sick leave and the big one -- ObamaCare's employer mandate -- minimum compensation for a full-time worker could rise as high as $19.28 an hour by 2020, an IBD analysis finds. That would amount to a jump of $10.67, or 124 percent, since June 2014.\" How cynical is the push for higher minimum wage? The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, traveled from state to state, collecting signatures to place minimum wage increase initiatives on ballots. To pull this off, the organization needed to hire lots of workers. In 1995, ACORN came to California to gather signatures for a higher minimum wage. But ACORN sued the state, seeking to exempt itself from California's minimum wage and overtime laws. Its brief read, \"The more ACORN must pay each individual outreach worker -- either because of minimum wage or overtime requirements -- the fewer outreach workers it will be able to hire.\" Not cynical enough? Union leaders, who successfully lobbied for LA's $15-an-hour minimum wage, then asked for an exemption for any firms using union labor! Repeat, the very same union leaders who successfully lobbied for a $15-an-hour minimum wage, then wanted an exemption for businesses that employ union labor and negotiate their wages under collective bargaining. Union bosses want the fear of a $15 minimum wage hike to push companies into unionizing their labor forces. This push for higher minimum wage will mostly hurt women -- a constituency that the left claims to care so much about. According to the National Women's Law Center, women are at least half of the minimum-wage workers in all 50 states. In New Hampshire, Arkansas, Maine and Pennsylvania, 70 percent of the minimum wage workers are female. Before the ever-increasing minimum wage laws took effect, a black teenager was slightly more likely to be employed than a white teenager. Economist Walter Williams writes: \"In the 1940s and 1950s ... teenage unemployment among blacks was slightly lower than among whites, and black teens were more active in the labor force as well. All of my classmates, friends, and acquaintances who wanted to work found jobs of one sort or another.\" Minimum wage and other New Deal policies, according to CATO's Jim Powell, cost jobs: \"The flagship of the New Deal was the National Industrial Recovery Act, passed in June 1933. It authorized the president to issue executive orders establishing some 700 industrial cartels, which restricted output and forced wages and prices above market levels. The minimum wage regulations made it illegal for employers to hire people who weren't worth the minimum because they lacked skills. As a result, some 500,000 blacks, particularly in the South, were estimated to have lost their jobs.\" Today's push for a higher minimum wage occurs as the supposed \"pay gap\" between male and female millennials now approaches extinction. Pew Research Center says: \"(T)oday's young women are the first in modern history to start their work lives at near parity with men. In 2012, among workers ages 25 to 34, women's hourly earnings were 93 percent those of men. ... And women in the younger age cohort were significantly more likely than their male counterparts to have completed a bachelor's degree ?- 38 percent versus 31 percent in 2013.\" Two years ago, Elissa Shevinsky, described as a \"social justice warrior,\" complained about \"sexism\" in high-tech industries. She argued for policies to encourage more women in tech. But Shevinsky later had an epiphany: \"I think the more important meaning is to actively choose a path that's yours -- for women to create their own companies and their own infrastructures, to actively seek out people and create places that are a fit for them. Women are martyring themselves trying to change the existing culture, and it's miserable for everyone.\" In other words, stop acting like victicrats -- and take control. Shevinsky now says, \"Complaining can be effective but also authoritarian, and often unpleasant for everyone involved. Building something new can be even more impactful, and I believe it's a healthier approach.\" Former Sony Pictures co-chief Amy Pascal gives equally blunt advice about knowing and getting what you're worth. After the Sony cyberattack revealed that the studio head paid star Jennifer Lawrence less money than her less-popular male costars, Pascal offered this defense: \"Here's the problem. I run a business. People want to work for less money; I'll pay them less money. I don't call them up and say, 'Can I give you some more?' Because that's not what you do when you run a business. The truth is, what women have to do is not work for less money. They have to walk away. People shouldn't be so grateful for jobs. ... People should know what they're worth.\" Any questions? .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Anyone who follows politics knows that the mainstream media has two sets of rules: one set for conservatives and another set for liberals. Conservatives spend most of their time correcting smears and trying to explain to the public what they really believe. Liberals, on the other hand, can count on the press to hide their unpopular beliefs and put the best spin possible on everything they do. This is why you often hear Republicans say, \"Imagine what they'd say if a Democrat had said that,\" while you almost never hear Democrats say, \"Imagine what they'd say if a Republican had said that.\" Those two separate sets of rules shape how politicians behave, how they're perceived, and the issues that they spend most of their time talking about. In Barack Obama's case, the media would be focusing on an entirely different set of issues if he were a Republican. 1) This guy is way too stupid to be President of the United States! Poor Dan Quayle was forever branded as stupid for misspelling the word potato. It's not often noted, however, that the card that he was given by the school had misspelled the word. Then there's Obama, the man who stammers without a teleprompter, the guy who won't release his college records. How does Quayle's gaffe compare to Obama thinking there are 57 states? Duhr! How about Obama walking into a window at the White House? Duhr, duhr! What about signing a guest book 2008 in 2011? Duhr, duhr, duhr! Obama's stupidity would be a staple of late night talk show jokes if he were a Republican. 2) Obama's an amateurish cowboy who's wrecking our image around the world! Obama has made Jimmy Carter look like a foreign policy mastermind since he got into the White House. Sure, he gets credit for getting Osama Bin Laden. When the military walked up to Obama and said, \"We know where Bin Laden is. Can we go get him?\" he made the \"gutsy call\" to say \"yes.\" Of course, he's also damaged our relations with Britain, Israel, and Pakistan. He's screwed things up so badly with Pakistan that it's endangering the war effort in Afghanistan. His administration gave Russia a \"reset button\" that actually said \"overcharge.\" The fact you probably don't even know about how badly we screwed things up in Honduras is telling. Then, there's Obama's impulsive and bizarre insertion of the American military into a civil war in Libya. If Obama were a Republican, the media would be telling us we need to get a Democrat in office to repair the damage caused by Obama's blundering. 3) Obama's going to bankrupt the country by giving our money to his corporate cronies! Remember when the media talked about the size of the deficit all the time? Remember when we heard about Halliburton and Blackwater on a daily basis? Oh, yes, that was when we had a Republican President. Now we've got the most wasteful spender in the history of our country in the White House, we're in danger of going bankrupt, and tens of billions in tax dollars have been transferred to corporations that have given money to the Democratic Party. Now suddenly the \"fierce watchdogs of the press\" have become completely complacent about corporate cronyism and the very real possibility that our country will turn into Greece within the next decade. 4) He's the job-killing, gas-price-raising, economy-wrecking President! Can you imagine the stories we'd see every day if a Republican were President? We'd have daily stories on the people left homeless by the “Obamaconomy,” human interest stories about single mothers who can't feed their kids anymore, and we'd hear from experts every day about how Obama is killing jobs, raising costs at the pump, and destroying the economy with his policies. Remember how the press used to slip a reference to George Bush speaking in front of the \"Mission Accomplished\" banner into every story about Iraq? Well, they'd do the same thing with Barack Obama's empty promises about how his 1.1 trillion dollar stimulus would \"save or create jobs.\" Can you hear them now? \"So, how's the economy looking? Gas prices still high? Are we seeing any impact of the stimulus yet? How many jobs have been 'saved or created’ -- and that's a meaningless, made up phrase by the way...” 5) Obama's not an authentic black man. Black conservatives have their \"blackness\" challenged all the time, often by privileged white liberals who don't know any black people other than the ones who clean their mansions. If Barack Obama were a Republican, he'd be called an Oreo, a half-white house slave, and a white man pretending to be black. On the upside for the Clintons, Democrats would still be calling Bill Clinton the first (and only) black President. 6) He's an arrogant jerk who cares about no one but himself! Vacation, golf, shooting hoops -- the fun never stops for Barack Obama. It would be great if the rest of us could take that much time off, but our jobs keep us too busy. It's also fantastic that Obama finally went to Joplin, Missouri. If you're wondering why it took so long, well, they didn't have a golf course cleared until now. Have you heard that some Republicans have taken to calling Barack Obama \"Mr. Spock\" because of his \"cool\" demeanor? Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure Mr. Spock never wore mom jeans, he could talk without a teleprompter, and Bones was around to tell him, \"Damnit Spock, it's not logical for the President to ignore the BP oil spill for so long. So, get your Vulcan behind in gear and do something!\" .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "The only real accountability for the Benghazi scandal will have to come in 2016. Reading through the competing partisan reports and listening to the congressional testimony of various officials this week, it seems fair to say that no actual crimes were committed (though you never know what you don't know). There were, in at least a figurative sense, criminal lapses in judgment by senior officials. Many of those lapses are recounted in the Accountability Review Board report. It found \"systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department\" that \"resulted in a special mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place.\" Translation: U.S. officials were caught by surprise by a terrorist attack on 9/11 in a country where our ambassador had repeatedly warned his superiors -- including then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- that security was grossly inadequate. That ambassador, Christopher Stevens, was vindicated in a pyrrhic sense when he was murdered by well-organized terrorists. Clinton picked four of the five members of the \"independent\" board, and they were kind enough to show her a draft before they released it to Congress. The ARB assigned all meaningful blame to some mid-level officials. ARB members declined to interview Clinton because, according to testimony Thursday by Ambassador Thomas Pickering and Admiral Michael Mullen (the chairman and vice-chairman of the ARB), they determined at the outset that it wouldn't be necessary. None of the people who were interviewed for the report were under oath. For those who followed the still-unfolding scandal at the IRS, this might be significant. Initially, IRS official Lois Lerner tried to pin all of the blame of some low-level employees in Cincinnati. When employees were questioned by congressional investigators -- away from their bosses and under oath -- evidence was found to help prove Lerner's account a well-orchestrated lie. Congressional Republicans would like to get relevant witnesses to testify under oath, but they claim that the State Department and CIA are blocking that. CNN has reported that many potential CIA witnesses have been subjected to \"frequent, even monthly\" lie detector tests to discourage them from leaking information. One insider told CNN: \"You have no idea the amount of pressure being brought to bear on anyone with knowledge of this operation,\" Said another: \"You don't jeopardize yourself, you jeopardize your family as well\" if you talk to anyone about what happened. That's all very ominous, and I'm at a loss as to why it's outrageous for Congress to try to get to the bottom of what happened. But to listen to defenders of the administration and a lot of allegedly neutral journalists, this basic exercise in congressional oversight is a deranged and entirely fabricated partisan witch hunt. It's an odd charge given that the only obvious fabrication in the whole affair was the relentless effort to cast the attack that killed four Americans as a spontaneous reaction to an obscure and shoddy YouTube video. But we probably know what happened. In the midst of a hard-fought presidential election, the administration, and specifically the president, was caught embarrassingly flat-footed by a terrorist attack. And even when it knew the attack was still going on -- without any possible knowledge of when it was going to end -- it still failed to send any help. The ARB establishes that much. In their testimony Thursday, Pickering and Mullen softened that criticism by noting that the U.S. military can't be expected to defend every diplomatic outpost everywhere in the world all of the time. Fair enough. But maybe it's not unreasonable for the military to be ready for an attack in, say, the Middle East on Sept. 11? Particularly in a country where officials knew security was a huge problem? At the time, the Obama campaign had been touting its success in the war on terror. The last thing it wanted less than 60 days before the election was to lose that issue. So, afraid of the political fallout, the White House and the State Department circled the wagons. Hillary Clinton is a master of the passive-aggressive art of dragging out investigations until the press and public lose interest and spinners can use abracadabra phrases like \"it's all old news,\" \"let's just move on\" and, most famously, \"what difference does it make?\" The irony in this case is that it's precisely that tactic that has now turned a political problem for Obama into a political problem for Clinton. And unfortunately, the only real accountability we can hope for on Benghazi will come when she runs for president herself. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

Many of them have furthered the extreme pro-abortion agenda of this administration. In addition to such orders, the administration has ruled with a pro-abortion iron fist in other ways as well. Some of these examples from the first 100 days include: Fortunately, there are groups out there which have put together resources to expose such a pro-abortion agenda and educate voters on what went on during President Biden's first 100 days in office, and why that's so detrimental to protecting the right to life.

The memo also highlighted FRCAction's \"Tracking the Biden Administration\" web page. In addition to the list of \"Actions\" in the tweet above, the web page also offers links to \"Biden Personnel\" and \"Biden/Harris Historical Record.\" As the 100 day mark came and went, the FRC Twitter account was also active in calling out such a pro-abortion agenda in such a short amount of time.

        "articles": "Refugees are the new black. They’re the new Hansel – they’re so hot right now. Liberals love them more than their own children, and certainly more than Americans not in their families. The most common argument made by leftists in support of opening the doors of the country to those fleeing failed states is “we have a moral obligation to do so.” But do we? First, I’d be remiss if I didn’t note the irony of those who spent the last few decades lecturing us on how you “can’t legislate morality” when it comes to issues such as abortion now arguing that you can’t legislate it, but you can mandate it. Putting that aside, what do we owe people from war-torn areas of the world, particularly those controlled by an enemy we are currently fighting? Actually, nothing. Yes, we are fighting ISIS side-by-side with the Iraqi military and Syria rebels, with the Iraqis and Syrians carrying the lion’s share of the load. But the United States is fighting to stop an enemy that has killed relatively few Americans and tens, if not hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and even more Syrians. They aren’t doing us a favor; we are doing them one. Because it happens to be in our national security interest to fight ISIS does not change the fact that it’s in their interest as well. That is not “nothing,” as some claim we would be doing if President Trump’s Executive Order on immigration were to stand. All that would happen is people who’ve already fled war zones would not be able to resettle here for a short period of time while we figure out how to ensure they are who they say they are and they don’t pose a threat to Americans. The political left is more than willing to ignore that reality in the name of blackening the eye of the president. How else to explain how they deliberately ignore what we are doing to help these people? Or to describe how they willfully mislead the American people, particularly the useful idiot mobs turning up at airports, that these refugees are not flying directly from places such as Aleppo? To watch the nightly news or hear leftists talk, you’d swear there were “huddled masses” in the Aleppo International Airport bomb shelter and smoking lounge just waiting for their flight to start boarding. No, they are already gone. Refugees are already out of the country, physically safe from the war, and in refugee camps throughout the region. They need to be “rescued” from discomfort, not war. The problem, which President Trump tried to address, is we have no idea who they are and many of them can’t prove who they are. Syria, in particular, isn’t a functioning nation anymore; its refugees can’t obtain proof of who they are or whether they have a criminal record or ties to radical Islamic groups. To paraphrase our national security experts – you can’t check people’s backgrounds against nothing, and all we have is nothing. Well, we have a little more than nothing – we have their word. But that’s pretty much it. Liberals would rather take the unverifiable word of these people than the president, and would rather potentially put your life at risk than give him any sort of victory. Once refugees are here, they’re pretty much here. They’re under no obligation to return to their country once the conflict ends. Many choose to, but they’re free to stay and avail themselves of our social services, etc. That’s why it’s so important to make sure you know who’s on that plane before it takes off. We can’t. I wonder if any of these liberal politicians fighting so hard for people who aren’t American would be willing to sign a waiver assuming criminal and financial responsibility should any refugees granted admittance as a result of their actions commit an act of terror. Somehow I doubt it. As these brief-filing blowhards celebrate each temporary victory, it’s important to keep in mind what they’re fighting for…and it’s not you. They want to hurt the president, which they’re free to do. But if their political score-settling puts American lives at risk, it will be important to remember come the next election.

        "articles": "The University of Minnesota has warned one of its student-run publications that it needs to be more “culturally sensitive” when it comes to terrorists. Naturally, they didn’t word it quite that way. According to Campus Reform, during the Minnesota Republic’s annual funding request, the university dug-up a cover from four years ago and used it to admonish the paper for its “overt lack of sensitivity to the Arab world.” Anyone looking at the actual cover, however, would see the paper was merely mocking terrorists. The headline, “The Minnesota Republic: Terrorists Hate It,” makes the paper’s point acutely clear—the paper champions free speech and freedom of the press. Apparently, however, the university’s Student Service Fees Committee (SSFC) is not fully on board with these First Amendment rights. When students applied for funding for the Minnesota Republic, the SSFC committee came forward with the 2011 cover photo [emphasis added]: “While reviewing one of the sample publications, committee members came across material that demonstrated an overt lack of sensitivity to the portrayal of members of the Arab world. When pressed for information on how this piece made it into print, representatives informed the committee that, based on the date of this particular publication, the members responsible for that work are no longer in the organization and that this particular piece is not representative of the work produced by the organization today. After assessing this information, the Student Service Fee Committee would like to emphasize for the group the significance of culturally sensitive discourse on a campus like the University of Minnesota, which prides itself on being home to a wide range of values and beliefs held by members that originate from countless cultures across the globe. In the future, close attention may be paid to the content published by Students for a Conservative Voice to ensure that any material that is produced with student fee funds does not compromise the cultural harmony of the campus and to ensure that the material that is produced is not at odds with the criteria in place for receiving this funding.” Why would the committee feel the need to bring this issue up now? They themselves pointed out that no one from the particular issue is likely on staff. It was nothing more than fearmongering. More importantly: what about free speech and freedom of the press? The committee blatantly threatened the paper and for nothing less than the protection of terrorists. Lastly, speaking of being 'culturally sensitive,' isn't it a bit ignorant of the committee to imply that all members of the Arab world can relate to...terrorists? According to University of Minnesota student and Campus Reform correspondent Allison Maass, the paper habitually stirred up the embers around campus: \"Our publication, derived from the University of Minnesota’s Students for a Conservative Voice (SCV), allows students on campus to share their viewpoints no matter what—even if they are considered offensive. And no other publication on campus can say that. When Vice Provost of Student Affairs and Dean of Students Danita Young Brown apologized to students for a student group throwing a fiesta on the grounds that it might offend the Chicano and Latino students, we printed Goldy Gopher with a sombrero on the front cover. After the Charlie Hebdo attacks, we put a drawing of Muhammad on the cover, asking for speech over terror.\" As someone who has worked as the senior news editor of my university paper, I can say from personal experience that this is an absolute outrage. I hope the students of the Minnesota Republic continue to challenge their fellow students to think deeply and to converse openly about cultural issues.

        "articles": "A Tulsa police sergeant died Tuesday after being shot multiple times during a traffic stop. Sgt. Craig Johnson, 45, came to provide backup assistance to another officer who pulled over David Anthony Ware, 33, for an expired paper license. The suspect would not get out of the vehicle when officers said it would have to be towed, and that's when things escalated. Despite Johnson trying to use nonlethal force—the suspect pulled a gun on him and another officer. A struggle ensued, in which Sergeant Johnson fired his Taser at Mr. Ware, who removed the stun gun’s prongs from his body. Sergeant Johnson then used pepper spray on Mr. Ware, who pulled out a handgun and fired several rounds at the officers as they removed him from the car, the chief said. The condition of the other officer, Aurash Zarkeshan, 26, who had just finished training in May and had been on patrol for about six weeks, was described on Monday as critical. The Tulsa Fraternal Order of Police referred questions on Tuesday about Officer Zarkeshan’s condition to the Police Department, which did not give an update. Armin Zarkeshan, Officer Zarkeshan’s brother, said in a brief interview on Tuesday night that the officer was “doing better.” Mr. Ware was arrested later on Monday and was charged with first-degree murder, shooting with intent to kill and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, the authorities said. (The New York Times) This Joker looking prick, David Anthony Ware, shot and killed Tulsa Police Craig Johnson at a traffic stop during a traffic stop on Monday morning. Johnson's partner, Officer Aurash Zarkeshan, remains in critical condition.  pic.twitter.com/xjwxLWWoI4 Flag just lowered to half staff at Mingo Valley.  \"These are officers who have chosen to be in law enforcement at a historically challenging time,\" Tulsa's mayor, G.T. Bynum, said Monday during a news conference. \"Sergeant Johnson was a good man who made our lives better, who trained his fellow officers to be better ... our city mourns.\" Johnson is survived by a wife and two young children. The shooting comes as anti-police brutality protests sweep the nation in the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody. Calls to defund the police are also gaining steam, with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announcing $1 billion in cuts to the NYPD. In Minneapolis, the city council has also moved to defund the police. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/John Locher Well, one thing is clear. You’re not going to muzzle Newt Gingrich in how he feels about the 2020 election. He broke out the flamethrower during his media hit last Sunday. And the former Speaker of the House was also able to comment about something that got him muzzled by Fox News hosts back in September when he mentioned George Soros heavily funding Democrats in local races, specifically district attorney races. That’s also a fact; Fox News reported on it. Gingrich did not hold back at all, stating that this was a corrupt race, adding that Democrats stole five of six states. The legal fight should carry on, and rightfully so. We have allegations of voter fraud that are serious. We have dead people showing up. We have a United States Postal Worker who overheard a scheme to illegally backdate ballots. And no, he did not recant. That’s fake news. There are reports about scores of ballots in Georgia that have been flagged over change of address issues. There’s a lot of funny business going on which is why the Department of Justice is throwing its weight concerning looking into these allegations. That’s not to say this will flip some states, but it could toss some fraudulent ballots, chip away at Biden’s lead, and make 2020 a whole new ballgame. We’re still in Hail Mary territory. I mean, fourth and forever at our own 10-yard line, but there’s a chance. All we need is around 50,000 Biden ballots to be invalidated in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin for this to become very interesting. It would be a 269-269 Electoral College tie between Trump and Biden, which would lead to a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Votes are cast by state delegation in the House; the GOP leads 26-23 in that regard. But what about the claims that of this election being stolen, which host Jedidiah Bila pressed Gingrich on to clarify. The former House Speaker had the perfect response, but first, read the core of his remarks on the 2020 race. He led into his commentary by first offering his take on Joe Biden’s call for unity (via Real Clear Politics): NEWT GINGRICH: Well, it's a nice sentiment. First, you go out and the Democrats steal five or six states, and that's what Republicans believe we're watching. We think we have evidence of a lot of it. Then you turn around and you say let's forget four years of Nancy Pelosi, let's forgot four years ago of impeachment, harassment, opposition, hostility, hatred, and now that I've won, why don't we make nice together? I think he would have to do a lot to convince Republicans that this is anything except a left-wing power grab, financed by people like George Soros, deeply laid in at the local level, and, frankly, I think that it is a corrupt, stolen election. It's very hard for me to understand how we're going to work together without some very, very big steps by Biden. And I have -- I have doubts if the left-wing of his party would tolerate him genuinely trying to work with Republicans. […] JEDIDIAH BILA: Yeah, Newt. No, I just want to ask you for clarity, because the accusation of incidents of voter fraud, which do happen in every election, unfortunately, is very different from the accusation of a stolen election. That's very serious. The implication here is that there's enough widespread voter fraud going on that would have changed the outcome of the election. I haven't seen evidence of that to this moment. Is that what you're suggesting has happened here? GINGRICH: What I'm suggesting is you don't see the evidence because the local officials who are Democrats hide the evidence and then turn to you and say, \"Since you have no evidence.\" So they say, \"Oh, we let the poll watchers in the building.\" That's right. But they kept them far enough away they couldn't see anything. And I think I can show you case after case, it happened magically at almost exactly the same moment on election night that a series of key states quit counting, almost as though they were coordinating what they were doing. And then it happened a few hours later, about 4 in the morning, that they had huge data dumps of Biden votes. Now, I don't know how -- how do you prove that without really having to get the FBI directly involved? And given the FBI for the last four years, why would you trust them? The entire deep state has tried to destroy Trump for four years. We know it now as a fact. We know that -- how hard they worked to undermine him. And I think if you're a typical Trump supporter, you regard this as an effort by people on the left to do everything they can at every level, including the news media. The news media's 93% anti-Trump. Right on, Mr. Speaker. I’ve been mentally preparing myself for a Biden win. I’ve fluctuated. Last week was not good, but these new allegations and affidavits regarding voter fraud are worthy of an investigation. At the very least, there should be a total audit of the votes in the states in question. Until then, the votes are still being counted. And we have to make sure every legal vote is accounted for in this race. In the end, again, Biden could end up on top, but for now, let the legal challenges play out. Keep fighting. And do not give in to the liberal media’s nonsense.

On her watch we have witnessed the rise of Russia, Iran, and ISIS. Radical Islamic terrorists are on the march. Here at home, the Obama-Clinton economic policies have made life harder and harder for millions of hard-working Americans. \"We know that a Hillary Clinton Administration would be no different than an Obama Administration.\" Cruz also warned that Clinton will uphold President Obama's executive amnesty and Obamacare in addition to attacking constitutional rights held in the First and Second Amendments.

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/Darron Cummings It may be too late for the media to get the facts right about Breonna Taylor's death. At least too late to stop the riots currently being carried out in her name. So much of the death and destruction over recent months could have been avoided if the liberal media simply told the truth when it comes to police shootings of Black suspects. The drive-by media, as Rush Limbaugh calls it, shows up on the scene and breathlessly announces that police officers have shot and killed another unarmed black person; this time a young nurse who was sound asleep in her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. The few \"facts\" the media provides about the shooting turn out to be wrong, and all the context and factors leading up to Taylor's death are never mentioned by the mainstream media. And if the big tech companies get their way, the facts of these cases would never come out. On Twitter, Matt Walsh has been a brave and fearless voice countering so much of the BLM nonsense put out in recent months. His tweets on the Taylor shooting are no exception. The media's narrative goes that on the night of March 13, Louisville police executed a no-knock search warrant on Taylor's apartment under the mistaken belief that Taylor was somehow involved in the drug trade. After storming her residence, the police shot and killed Taylor as she was sound asleep in her bed. Here are the facts that exonerate the police of such malicious and outrageous lies. Everything you’re hearing about Breonna Taylor is a lie. It was not a no knock warrant. They did announce. The boyfriend fired first. And by the way, Breonna was apparently involved in her ex boyfriend’s drug enterprise. All of this info has been publicly available for weeks. The ex boyfriend said in jailhouse phone calls that Taylor was handling his cash and had thousands of dollars in drug money in her apartment Let’s walk through the steps. Officers obtain a legal warrant. Officers act on said warrant. Officers announce themselves. Officers enter residence. Officers return fire once fired upon.Where in this series of events does a crime occur — much less a racist execution? People looking to blame Taylor's death on anyone but Taylor herself should point to the boyfriend who opened fire on police officers. At that point, officers have every right to defend themselves. Many of the police-shooting lies come from family members of the \"victims\" and their attorneys who always accuse the police of malfeasance when trying to extract wrongful death payouts from cities and police departments. The race hucksters and liberal activists then jump on the lies because so much of the left's agenda depends upon America being seen as an irredeemably racist country. But the facts show otherwise, which is why the left always hides them. Reporters could get a lot of these facts right if they simply didn't take the word of these attorneys, race hucksters, BLM agitators, and liberal activists all pursuing an agenda. The media is terrorizing Black Americans, many of who buy into the liberal media's narrative that police officers are breaking into people's homes and murdering them in cold blood. When Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron announced on Wednesday that, after reviewing the evidence, no charges directly relating to Taylor's death would be brought against the police, young Black Americans who had been misled by the mainstream media were understandably outraged. The Daily Caller's Jorge Ventura interviewed one such woman who said she now lives in fear of the police. \"I really started to fear the police\" local #Louisville woman says in her reaction the grand jury announcement on the #BreonnaTaylor case pic.twitter.com/jG0wzarfvj All the \"woke\" companies that enable BLM's lies about the case, the athletes who wear Taylor's name on their jerseys, and the idiot celebrities who promulgate these falsehoods all get to go on with their lives and never suffer any of the real-world consequences for the violence and destruction they help cause.

        "articles": "If you’re cool with Americans being butchered by illegal aliens, this November you should vote Democrat. They’re certainly cool with Americans being butchered by illegal aliens. Oh, in theory they would probably prefer that the foreigners sneaking into our country in defiance of the laws we American citizens made through our elected representatives would stop butchering Americans. They don’t particularly want your kids to be butchered. They just want uncontrolled illegal immigration more than your kids’ safety. So, they’ve made a choice to be the party of illegal immigration. And the resulting body count is a price Democrats are willing to pay to replace an electorate of Normal Americans who refuse to obey. The Democrats are the party of No Borders, of Abolish ICE, and of murdered Americans. You cannot howl and shriek in support of X yet deny that you accept the foreseeable, demonstrated consequences of X. Now we know Mollie Tibbetts was murdered by an illegal alien. Add her name to the butcher’s bill. And who was shocked? Who said, “Gosh, that’s surprising!” Who said, “Whoa, I don’t believe it!” No one. Because it happens all the time. Her life, like the lives of so many others, was snuffed out because our elite made a conscious choice to risk our lives to satisfy its own interests. She was just more collateral damage. We better decide in November where we stand, because a Democrat majority means this bloodbath continues. Your daughter, shot dead in front of you on a wharf. Your son, knifed by gang members. Your daughter, murdered and dumped in an Iowa cornfield. That’s what you get if you elect Democrats, because that’s what their open borders policies enable. But our elite can live with that. They will live with that behind their communities’ gates, where their only experience with illegal immigration is their friendly, cheap nanny and industrious, cut-rate gardener. A few lives of people the elite will never meet is a small price to pay for a massive new Democrat constituency. And they’ll happily pay it. Am I being unfair? Is saying this outrageous? Go to hell. We’re sick of American citizens paying checks written in blood by a Democrat Party that absolutely refuses to allow our government to do the two most basic jobs of any government – securing our country’s borders and protecting our citizenry. Our citizenry, not foreigners. They have no right to be here. None. Those that are here stay here by our grace and at our pleasure. We are American citizens – and that includes my legal immigrant wife. This is our country. We rule, not an unaccountable elite that wants to import a more pliable electorate and a more pliable serf class to do the jobs Americans don’t want to do because the Chamber of Commerce types don’t want to pay them fairly. No more Americans should die because of our worthless elite’s greed. Not one more Jamiel Shaw. Not one more Kate Steinle. Not one more Mollie Tibbetts. How about our cities be sanctuaries for our children, not alien thugs? No more slaughtered victims sacrificed on the altar of political correctness. This fall, we need to stand up and demand to be heard. The Democrats will never listen, but the Republicans will. Some will listen because they get it, because they understand that this can’t go on. And others, the weak and the bought off and the feckless Fredocons of Conservative, Inc., will listen because if they don’t we’ll crush them at the ballot box. Here’s the platform. No amnesty. None. Go home. Abolish ICE? Quadruple ICE. Build the wall. A real wall, the kind that keep people out – and that keeps out the opioids and meth that wreck so many American lives. What are your questions, Republicans? Democrats, why are you willing to let even one more Mollie Tibbetts die? That’s what our platform must be, because these midterm elections are about our children’s lives. And maybe our kids don’t matter much to our useless elite, but they matter to us. Donald Trump tapped into the anger of Normal people at this outrage, this utter betrayal of American citizens, when he dared break the taboo and tell the truth about illegal immigration. It destroys American communities, it destroys American livelihoods, and it destroys American lives. As my upcoming book Militant Normals: How Regular Americans Are Rebelling Against the Elite to Reclaim Our Democracy explains, we Normals see what’s happening, and we’re fighting mad at an elite that does not care. To the elite, our protests are an annoyance. Another wonderful life gets snuffed out at the hands of someone they tolerated coming here illegally and being here illegally, and their first thought is how this is probably going to help Trump. Well, it better help him. You better vote like your life or your kid’s life depends on it, because it does.

        "articles": "Why?!! U.S. Olympic bobsledder Lauren Gibbs made Americans proud by winning a silver medal with her teammate Elana Meyers Taylor at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea a couple weeks ago. First Daughter Ivanka Trump and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders congratulated her on her achievement when they arrived at the Games as part of the U.S. delegation. Gibbs embraced both Ivanka and Sanders warmly, even doing a photoshoot with them. She proudly posted the photos, noting that while they may differ in ideology, they are all Americans and they each deserve respect. Some commended Gibbs for her positive demeanor. Others not so much. The hate quickly consumed her Twitter page, with users wondering how she could be so complicit by smiling and laughing with members of the \"racist\" Trump administration. Gibbs patiently responded to as many comments as she could, each time remaining cool headed. Instead of hurling insults at one another, why don't they try being civil, she suggested. But, the rude, hateful comments became too much for Gibbs. As of Thursday, the Olympian deleted the photos she took with Ivanka, explaining she was \"tired\" of the disrespectful dialogue. I deleted (by choice) the photo because I was tired of reading the hate being thrown back and forth. Whether you hate me for posting or hate me for taking it down... you are the same... hate from either side is hate... #samesame  via @BreitbartNews I don't blame Gibbs, I blame the haters. Who wouldn't be fed up with the nonsense. But, I can't help thinking that taking the photo makes the haters think they won. Still, Gibbs at least stands by what she said in earlier tweets. \"It was allowing people to spew hate at each other which broke my heart,\" Gibbs added. \"I still believe in what I said. I just wasn’t going to be a platform for people to be evil to each other.\" Thankfully, the video of her allowing Ivanka to try on her silver medal still exists. \"I feel like this is almost like trying on somebody's wedding ring. Am I allowed?\" — @IvankaTrump, asked if she wants to wear silver medal won by @lagibbs84 as part of the US's 2-person bobsled team. pic.twitter.com/omyy8XM5bI We are all proud of you and your achievements, Lauren!

        "articles": "If you had to name a theme for Obama’s second term, it would be regulatory overreach. Despite the repeated rejection of the President’s most controversial proposals by lawmakers, Mr. Obama has turned to his “pen and his phone” (and the vast government bureaucracy he controls) to enact his extreme and often unpopular agenda. Examples of the kind of executive overreach that have come to define his presidency include unilateral changes to Obamacare, sweeping new rules issued by the FCC designed to impose centuries railroad-style regulations on the internet, and the far-reaching and expensive red tape he is seeking to impose on our electricity grid including airline emissions, trucking companies, and even humble wood-burning stoves. The latest overreach, however, may quite literally take the cake and comes to us courtesy of the Food and Drug Administration. This sweeping regulation will directly affect what kinds of food we are allowed to purchase at our neighborhood grocery store. The FDA has long taken issue with “trans fat” a type of unsaturated fat found produced from vegetable fats. Products containing trans fat have become more widespread since the 1950’s when they appeared on the scene in the form of margarine and have since made their way into everything from frozen pizzas to Reese’s Pieces. While initially viewed as a healthy alternative to other fats, research indicates that overindulging can contribute to health risks. That conclusion led FDA regulators to require food manufacturers to label all their products containing trans fat. While many health conscious individuals choose to steer clear of products that contain trans fat (consumption has decreased 78 percent between 2003 and 2012), millions of Americans have continued to enjoy many of the delicious foods that contain trans fat, albeit in moderation. Unfortunately that’s a problem for the heavies at Mr. Obama’s FDA. Rather than letting people make their own decisions about whether to indulge in the occasional trans fat-laden snack, the FDA has just ordered a ban on trans fat, which federal regulators say food companies must remove from all of their products by 2018. And while the FDA is patting itself on the back, the ban will – like most everything else cooked up by federal regulators – may have serious unintended consequences. Foremost, the cost to food producers could be enormous. While many producers have moved away from trans fat on their own, the fats remain essential to many popular products due to its taste, texture and ability to preserve shelf life. Finding a replacement may not be easy or cheap, and consumers will ultimately face increased costs as a result. Worse, it’s entirely possible that the eventual “replacement” for trans fat may not be any healthier. But these are things federal regulators rarely consider when they try to control our behavior and supplant their all-knowing judgment for our own. At its core, this ban represents the worst of Washington. Rather than letting individuals decide what’s best for them, our all-knowing government overlords want to tell us they know better. These perpetual critics of freedom simply can’t sit idly by while Americans enjoy the occasional slice of frozen pizza, or handful of candy. For them, that kind of freedom is as dangerous as Reese’s Pieces. Kidding aside, Americans have little recourse when dealing with the alphabet soup of government agencies that continue to intrude into their daily lives regulating everything from light bulbs to groceries. That’s unfortunate. Families deserve to make their own decisions about what’s best for their lives. Congress should push back on ham-handed FDA regulation, and tell Mr. Obama’s bureaucrats to get their greedy hands out of our collective snack bowl. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Have you paid attention to the Obama news of the past week? It's amazing. It’s mind-boggling. It was a week of unimaginable destruction. Most people are so busy trying to survive the failing Obama economy, that they have no time to pay attention to the news. That is exactly the plan. Obama and his socialist cabal want you overwhelmed, mentally exhausted and distracted from the truth. Well if you see it all put down in writing, in one place, it's frightening and shocking. It's also clear as day that the cloak is off. Obama is no longer hiding his plans to destroy America. For anyone who isn’t blind, deaf or very dumb, it’s now all out in the open. The news of this past week proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Obama is accelerating the destruction of America. Let's look at the facts: This week the non-partisan CBO finally reported the truth – Obamacare is the perfect job-killing machine. Millions have already been downsized from full-time to part-time work and now we know from the CBO that an additional 2.3 million jobs will be eliminated. As I predicted from day one, this is exactly what Obamacare was intended to do- destroy the middle class and make us all dependent on government checks to survive. Obama’s Kool-Aid drinking supporters are so far in the tank that when the CBO courageously pointed out that Obamacare makes it less likely millions of Americans will want to work, they called it “choice.” Obama’s propagandists painted it a wonderful development. But letting middle class wage earners and small businesses pay for all those who want to be freed from the need to work, so they can enjoy their free time and pursue their hobbies isn’t “choice.” It’s theft. Folks, it is time to stop treading lightly and being politically correct. Let’s call it what it is. This is communism, pure and simple. Anyone who thinks “the American Dream” is to choose to stay home, not work, and collect a government check is reading directly from Karl Marx. Anyone who thinks some people (who vote 100% Democrat) should have a “choice” not to work, by stealing the money of others, is reading directly from “the Communist Manifesto.” Personally, I think “choice” is great. You can choose to not work anytime you want. But if you need to steal my money to do it, that’s called theft, not choice. Middle class wage earners are being ripped off to pay for free-loaders. That means middle class people are having their “choices” taken away from them. I guess in Obama’s playbook one man’s choice is another man’s slavery. But, that was only the start of the week. Next Obama illegally re-wrote his own Obamacare law- again. Mimicking the traits of communist dictators and tin pot tyrants, Obama obviously believes he can change any law he wants, at any given hour, of any given day. One of the main chapters of my book was titled: “America the Banana Republic.” Just this week Charles Krauthammer said what’s happening under Obama “is the stuff you do in a banana republic.” Welcome to the club Charles. It’s nice to see D.C. establishment Republicans are finally seeing the light. In America it’s a violation of the Constitution for the President to wake up on the wrong side of the bed and decide to make, arbitrarily change, or break laws. This is the behavior of Fidel Castro, or the late tyrant Hugo Chavez. But wait, it gets far worse. As part of the new illegal Obamacare directive to postpone the law for businesses with 50 to 99 employees, Obama put the IRS in direct control of critical U.S. business decisions. He demanded that businesses must “justify” hiring and firing decisions to the IRS to qualify for the exemption. Plain and simple, putting government in charge of the decisions of a private business is the very foundation of communism. It is how communist economies like North Korea, Cuba, the old Soviet Union, and East Germany have always been run. Still, Obama wasn’t done. To show his total disdain for Congress and the American people he unilaterally loosened the rules for citizenship to allow foreigners with only a “minor” connection to terrorism to become citizens. Dennis Miller once said on Monday Night Football, “there is no such thing as a minor groin injury.” Well there is no such thing as a “minor” terrorist either. Why is our President desperate to open the borders and let in “minor” terrorists? It’s not like we have a surplus of jobs. What is the pressing need in a country with 92 million unemployed working-age Americans? Has corporate America put out an emergency request for “minor” terrorist employees? Or is this how Obama creates instant Democratic voters? Much along the same lines, Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder announced this week how \"unjust\" it is to not allow felons to vote. No Mr. Attorney General, the only thing “unjust” was the crimes these felons committed. What’s the emergency here? Is there a shortage of Democratic voters? Obama’s game plan is clearly to combine felons with radical Muslim terrorists in order to guarantee Democrat dominance for years to come. This was just one week in Obama's America. The evil and terrible news is coming in waves. And it’s all coming from one man. A man no longer hiding the fact that he is a tyrant, dictator, radical Marxist, and hater of America, capitalism and Judeo Christian values. Why the sudden rush? My educated guess is Obama and his Marxist cabal see the writing on the wall. The disastrous effects of Obamacare are hitting home. Obama can spew all the fancy talk and propaganda he wants, but this time the people are experiencing the devastating effects of Obama's policies- health insurance policy cancellations, huge price increases, trusted doctors no longer in the network, prescriptions no longer covered, deductibles raised by thousands, and jobs being killed by the millions. Obama faces a middle class revolt. A GOP landslide like 2010. His internal polls show a disaster headed his way. Knowing Democrats can no longer get elected, or re-elected, Obama has decided to go it alone. Without regard for the law, the Constitution, or the American people, he has obviously decided to do the most damage possible to America during his final three years. He’s finally taken off the mask and shown himself to be the true communist tyrant he is. Obama no longer cares to hide his radical Marxist ideology. It’s now clear it’s “pedal to the metal” towards the destruction of America. But folks, this was only one week of damage. We have 3 more years to go. If someone doesn't stand up to Obama, we aren't going to make it. And that is exactly what Obama is betting.

        "articles": "Unsurprisingly, President Donald J. Trump was correct. Though he originally spoke, or tweeted, clumsily, the gist of his claim was correct: The administration of his predecessor, Barack H. Obama, had indeed been surveilling Trump and those close to his campaign. As I showed in a previous article, The New York Times, Slate, Mother Jones, and Heat Street—i.e. Democratic Party propaganda organs—are among the media outlets that confirmed months ago the President’s claim. Theses surveillance efforts had been transpiring from at least the time of last summer. It’s true that it has not yet been proven that either Trump or any other private American citizens in his orbit were subjects or targets of these surveillance efforts. Ostensibly, foreigners, specifically, Russians, were the subjects. But it is equally true that arrangements were made by those within Obama’s government—the so-called “Deep State”—to illegally unmask and leak public information regarding those private citizens that allegedly got swept up in these spying operations. For those still not convinced by this, Evelyn Farkas should remove all doubt. Under Obama, Farkas was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for “Russia/Ukraine/Eurasia,” according to the website for the U.S. Department of Defense. She left her position in 2015 to become an adviser to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Earlier in March, she appeared on MSNBC and made the following comments on Morning Joe: “I was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, people on the Hill…[to] get as much information as you can, as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration.” Farkas admitted that she “had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people [from the Obama administration] who left.” She feared that it would disappear into the abyss of “the bureaucracy,” and “that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about…the Trump staff’s dealing with Russia, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods.” There are several telling insights to glean from Farkas’ remarks. First, Farkas here acknowledges that the Obama administration, essentially, had indeed been gathering intelligence, or spying, on private citizens. Second, being the Democrat partisan that she obviously is, Farkas’ intention in making these comments, and making them in the left-friendly venue of MSNBC, was to suggest that the Democrats’ “The Russians Made Us Do It (Lose)” narrative has substance. Yet, notice, Farkas never said that the intel proved anything so much as resembling “collusion” between Putin or “the Russians” and Trump. Had there been anything there, she would have done what no one has yet to do and offer at least a scintilla of evidence to substantiate this charge. Third, in fact, Farkas never even mentions any correspondence between Trump and “the Russians.” No, she instead references “Trump folks” and “the Trump staff” when talking about Russia. Fourth, while Farkas obviously wanted for audiences to think that Obama’s government discovered some nefarious connection between “Trump folks” and those dastardly Russians, the only allusion that she ever manages to make is to the “dealings” that she alleges transpired between these groups. In other words, Farkas’s wording here is profoundly vague. Fifth, Farkas unwittingly confesses that she worried about “the Trump folks” discovering “how we knew what we knew….” Is it not eminently reasonable to infer from this statement that the “how” in question, the methods by which intelligence was supposedly gathered, consists of surveillance of the “Trump folks?” Finally, Farkas admits to being worried about how the Trump administration would react when it found out “how we knew what we knew….” Who is this “we?” Farkas was no longer in the government as of 2015. Yet her choice of words would have us think that she is still very much involved in and allied with bureaucrats in the Deep State. Moreover, given her standing as a Democrat and her position in the Obama administration, it’s all too sensible to think that Farkas’ selection of the first person-plural in this context refers to Farkas and her fellow partisans that remain embedded in the bureaucracy over which her former boss presided. Farkas has tried retreating from her comments. The left-leaning media has been busy spinning them away. But the cat is out of the bag: The Deep State, under Obama, surveilled American citizens, in this case, Trump and his “folks.” They wanted the information that they had gathered to be as widely disseminated—leaked—as possible. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        "articles": "Source: AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin As anyone paying attention to American politics for the past 50 years can attest, the left has abided by one basic principle from which they never waver. Such is, when you can’t make a rational argument for or against something, make a racist or sexist one. Identity politics and perceived victimhood are the preferred weapons of the modern Democrat party and they wield them in defense of their positions more viciously than a mama grizzly protecting her cubs. It’s hard to forget Joe Biden’s famous 2012 shot at the Republican Romney/Ryan ticket to a mostly black audience, “They're Going To Put Y'all Back In Chains!” Since the Obama ticket was in a virtual toss-up with Romney at the time, it was time for Biden invoke slavery rather than stand on his ticket’s economic policy. This past 4th of July celebration, a celebration of our national unity, saw Colin Kaepernick, the one-time NFL quarterback continue his assault on all things American that cost him his once truly mediocre career. After the public reaction to his hatred of this country (along with his QB rating and overdeveloped sense of self-worth) cost him his ability to publicly kneel for the anthem, Kaepernick determined the planned Nike “Betsy Ross Flag” shoe was just too racist to stand, or kneel, for. Yes, Betsy Ross, abolitionist, Quaker, and alleged designer of the flag, apparently, was a racist. Kaepernick couldn’t persuade with his kneeling argument, so he launched a racist attack on sneaker. The current debate over the constitutionally mandated decennial U.S. Census has led to Democrats in Congress charging that the simple inclusion of the question, “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” is fundamentally and inherently racist. That question has been asked in one form or another since 1820 save for 2010 under President Obama. Further, the very same question is asked annually by the American Community Survey, under, yes, the Census Bureau. Even the United Nations, in their Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses, encourages asking the question. The “citizenship question” is necessary for the allocation of resources, fair allotment of Congressional seats, and to understand our immigration situation. Yet, since Congressional Democrats can’t refute these fundamental truths, they are compelled by both necessity and tradition to denounce the very question as racist. Nancy Pelosi recently, and absent any support, declared the question was part of President Trump’s effort to “make America white again.” Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, never one to sit out a fake race war, chimed in with, “It's about reducing the number of people of color being counted in the census. That's exactly what it's about.” No substantive arguments, again. No rational argument, so just a racist one. Amusingly enough, prominent Democrats have now turned their racist firing squad into a circular one. An assault typically reserved for Republicans and independents who might dare to disagree, has now become the attack of choice in the ongoing Democrat civil war. Last month’s Democratic Debates saw California Senator and identity politics warrior Kamala Harris attack frontrunner Joe Biden for his past associations with segregationists. She also attacked him for, believe it or not, having remarkably similar positions to herself on school busing. Substantive arguments be damned, let the racist missiles fly. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s very public, and rather entertaining, feud with Nancy Pelosi has seen the same deranged disintegration into racist attacks. AOC’s Chief of Staff Saikat Chakrabarti, in a since deleted tweet, denounced blue-dog moderate Democrats as, basically, segregationists, saying, “They certainly seem hell-bent to do black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s”. The Speaker reportedly fired back behind closed doors. That, coupled with Pelosi’s public dismissals of the extreme left of her party such as “that’s like five people” and, “They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”, has really got AOC’s racial fire raging. Responding to Pelosi, AOC quickly declared, “But the persistent singling out ... it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful ... the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color”. Wait, what did anything Pelosi said of any of her even more left flank have to do with race or gender? Nothing, but it was the very first instinctive response from someone raised on identity politics. The Democrat establishment relies on identity politics attacks for three simple reasons. They are accustomed to it, they believe that it works, and they have very little else with which to advance their agenda. It will also ultimately prove to be their downfall for three simple reasons. The American people are tired of it, it doesn’t work, and it is now destroying the left from the inside. This is a train wreck that one cannot look away from. .com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis. ",
