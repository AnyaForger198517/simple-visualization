But she said she was open to some technology and other improvements at the border so long as they were not related in any way to the planning, prepping or building of the wall itself.

        "articles": "Advertisement James Baker Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) on Wednesday released transcript of former FBI counsel James Baker’s second interview with the House Judiciary Committee. James Baker gave two explosive testimonies to the House Judiciary Committee in October of 2018 in an unclassified setting. Advertisement - story continues below According to the newly released transcript, James Baker refused to answer when Congressman Mark Meadows asked if multiple Trump associates (besides Carter Page) were spied on with FISA warrants. It is believed that Obama’s corrupt DOJ and FBI obtained FISA warrants on General Mike Flynn, Paul Manafort and George Papadopoulos, however it has not been confirmed. TRENDING: Kentucky Health Care Workers Refused to Comply With Vaccine Mandate, Forced Hospital to Fire Them (VIDEOS) Baker’s refusal to answer Meadows suggests that Obama’s FBI and DOJ indeed spied on Flynn and others with FISA warrants. Meadows wanted to know how many FISA warrants related to Russia collusion that James Baker reviewed as it related to the probable cause portion. Advertisement - story continues below “How many FISA applications did you review as it relates to Russia?” Meadows asked Baker. FBI lawyers interjected and wouldn’t let Baker answer, claiming the information is “sensitive” and “almost always classified.” Meadows continued to push back. “Well, there was a text message in a nonclassified setting that would indicate that there were multiple FISA applications, as many as 17 different FISA applications that may or may not have related to this particular subject,” Meadows said, adding, “Would it surprise you to know that there were — or is there more FISA applications beyond just the Carter Page FISA application that we’ve been discussing as it relates to this investigation?” An FBI lawyer interjected and would not let James Baker answer Meadows’s questions on the FISA applications. Advertisement - story continues below Meadows continued, “There’s multiple texts. There’s multiple texts that would indicate Lisa Page — it’s in a text message between Lisa Page and Andy McCabe that says, you know, your particular — I can read it. Would you like me to read it?” Meadows was referring to a text exchange between Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that took place on October 19th, 2016, just two days before the first FISA warrant was opened on Carter Page. “There will be nine packages for you to sign, with the possibility of eight additional if the NSLB signs off on them. They’ll probably won’t be WUDsd (ph) by 7:30. The FISA team will be delivering them at 7.” Lisa Page said in a text to McCabe. “Were there multiple FISA applications?” Meadows asked after reading Lisa Page’s October 2016 text to McCabe. Advertisement - story continues below “Were there other individuals connected directly or indirectly with the Trump campaign that had a FISA warrant placed on them for the purpose of surveilling conversations and collecting data other than Carter Page that you’re aware of?” Meadows asked again. “I’m not going to answer it right now,” Baker responded. An FBI lawyer [name redacted] objected to Meadows’s question and promised to follow up with the Republican lawmaker perhaps in a classified setting. Obama’s corrupt FBI and DOJ obtained one FISA warrant and three subsequent renewals (4 total) on Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. The final FISA warrant was signed in June of 2017 by DAG Rod Rosenstein and Andrew McCabe AFTER Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate Trump-Russia collusion. Baker’s refusal to answer Meadows strongly suggests others in Trump’s orbit were also spied on with FISA warrants — this is one of the biggest scandals in US history and all roads lead back to Obama and Hillary Clinton.

        "articles": "Joe Biden interrupted his mid-week vacation in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware Friday morning to give remarks on the economy following the release of the “unexpected” weak May jobs report. As Biden walked out of the room after finishing his comments he answered two shouted questions about his infrastructure negotiations with Congress. One reporter shouted a third question, “Do you still have confidence in Dr. Fauci?”, as Biden disappeared behind a set of double doors. Several staffers followed Biden through the one door that was open. Suddenly, after the passing of about seven seconds, Biden’s hand grabbed the closed door as he partially leaned around the door and his head peeked out. Biden said, “Yes, I’m very confident in Dr. Fauci,” and then again disappeared behind the doors. It was an odd show of support in that Biden didn’t put himself out front of reporters to make his declaration. It was also an odd moment for a White House press corps that worships Fauci as the patron saint of COVID but apparently smells blood in the water following the release of Fauci’s emails and a breakthrough Vanity Fair article on the federal government’s internecine battles over the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TRENDING: Kentucky Health Care Workers Refused to Comply With Vaccine Mandate, Forced Hospital to Fire Them (VIDEOS) What a disgrace. The top officials at the FBI and DOJ hated Donald Trump and his supporters. The Deep State hacks called Trump supporters: F***ing Idiots, Sad, Pathetic, Retarded. Advertisement - story continues below Fox News reported: The report revealed instant messages between unnamed agents, labeled “Agent 1” and “Agent 5,” discussing their jobs in August 2016. “I find anyone who enjoys [this job] an absolute f—ing idiot. If you don’t think so, ask them one more question. Who are you voting for? I guarantee you it will be Donald Drumpf,” Agent 1 sent. “I forgot about drumpf…that’s so sad and pathetic if they want to vote for him,” Agent 5 responded. “Someone who can’t answer a question. Someone who can’t be professional for even a second.” In September, Agent 1 and 5 conversed again, bashing Trump supporters as “retarded.” Advertisement - story continues below “I’m trying to think of a ‘would I rather’ instead of spending time with those people,” Agent 5 sent. Agent 1 asked, “stick your tongue in a fan??” Agent 5 later wrote: “I would rather have brunch with trump and a bunch of his supporters like the ones from ohio that are retarded.” The report did not, however, find evidence connecting those political opinions held by FBI officials to decisions made in the Clinton investigation. Advertisement - story continues below Futher, the report said that while it found no evidence the views influenced investigative decisions, “five employees” have been referred for investigation into whether the messages violated FBI code. “The FBI will handle these referrals pursuant to the FBI’s disciplinary investigation and adjudication processes, and will impose disciplinary measures as warranted,” the report read. It is unclear which five FBI employees have been referred for investigation. An FBI spokesperson told Fox News Thursday they were not able to comment on the names of the five employees referred for investigation.

John CarIin was previously chief of staff to FBI Director Robert Mueller. In September of 2016 Carlin manipulated the FISA court by misleading them on the Section 702 certifications. Carlin never informed the court of FBI contractors having access to the NSA database and exporting the search results to unknown actors. The FBI was using the database to monitor 2016 political campaigns and political opposition.

Carlin departed the NSD October 15, 2016, five days before the Carter Page FISA was approved by the FISC. It was John Carlin who ultimately facilitated the fraudulent FISA application against Carter Page in order to continue surveillance of the risk represented by Donald Trump. John Carlin’s legal counsel in the NSD was Michael Atkinson. Carlin is now back at the DOJ and expected to go at it again with the corrupt crew again.

        "articles": "Advertisement Monday, Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe, tweeted a video of Washington Post reporter Aaron Davis attempting to ambush the group’s imminent undercover bombshell video on the paper. Advertisement - story continues below Leading up to the video release, WaPo reporters were panicking and stalking the Project Veritas headquarters! In Monday’s undercover video, Washington Post National Security Correspondent Dan Lamothe and Director of Product Joey Marburger speak to the paper’s hidden agenda. Evidently, covering Trump the way they do is good business, even though it’s fake news. The left-wing media went crazy and relentlessly attacked James O’Keefe, claiming the guerrilla journalist is ‘irrelevant’ and ineffective. This only motivated O’Keefe to up the ante so he bragged about having inside sources at WaPo and subsequently leaked an internal email showing panic had spread. An email was sent by the Washington Post’s deputy managing editor Tracy Grant to the paper’s entire newsroom notifying reporters of a policy change in respect to visitation. “Beginning immediately, all requests to bring groups into the newsroom — whether students, visiting journalists, representatives of governments or other groups — must be cleared with me. Even for approved groups, we may limit where they can go and the use of still or video cameras,” wrote Grant. On Tuesday, O’Keefe tweeted out a poll asking the public which WaPo reporter he should expose next as he teased the new video was about to drop. Which @washingtonpost employee will we expose on hidden camera next? #AmericanPravda The choices were between, Marty Baron, Adam Entous, Fred Ryan or Melissa McCullough Which @washingtonpost employee will we expose on hidden camera next?#AmericanPravda — James O’Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) November 28, 2017 Now this… WaPo’s National Security reporter Adam Entous admits the Russia story is a “f*cking crapshoot” and there is no evidence suggesting Trump colluded with the Russians during the 2016 presidential election. Entous says: “But we really haven’t addressed… Our reporting has not taken us to a place where I would be able to say with any confidence that the result of it is going to be the president being guilty of being in cahoots with the Russians. There’s no evidence of that that I’ve seen so far. “We’ve seen a lot of flirtation, if you will, between them but nothing that, in my opinion, would rank as actual collusion. Now that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist, it just means we haven’t found it yet. Or maybe it doesn’t exist.” Melissa McCullough, the Director of Newsroom Operations, expresses her bias against Trump, admitting “let’s just hope he doesn’t get re-elected in another three years.” McCullough then backpedals and says, “I shouldn’t be saying these things because we don’t… We’re not supposed to really talk about that kind of stuff.” Once again, O’Keefe catches fake news sycophants admitting there is no evidence to support the Russian collusion story yet they continue to roll out blazing ‘Trump-Russia’ headlines.

According to The Tatler and Power Line Blog Larry Reid is prime suspect in his brother’s beating. On Monday I got a phone call from a man named Easton Elliott. We talked briefly on Monday, and have had additional telephone conversations since then. Elliott* is a businessman who lives in the Las Vegas area, and he thinks he knows what really happened to Harry Reid. This is the story as he related it to me: Elliott spent a portion of last New Year’s Eve at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Henderson, Nevada. His AA group has meetings every hour on New Year’s Eve, along with a pot luck supper. There were approximately 20 people present at the meeting during the events described below. Some time between 10:00 and 11:30 p.m., a man entered the meeting. His appearance was striking: there was blood on his clothing, beginning around his midsection. His left hand was swollen. He appeared to be somewhat intoxicated and was visibly agitated. He introduced himself as “Larry.” Advertisement - story continues below In a group discussion that was heard by a number of people, Larry said that he had just had a fight with a family member. Larry said he had been at a family get-together, and he didn’t remember much about the fight because he had blacked out. When he came to, he was rolling on the ground, fighting with a family member, and his clothes were bloody. Now, he said, he was frightened that the Secret Service would come after him.

On September 28, 1868, a mob of Democrats massacred nearly 300 African-American Republicans in Opelousas, Louisiana. The savagery began when racist Democrats attacked a newspaper editor, a white Republican and schoolteacher for ex-slaves. Several African-Americans rushed to the assistance of their friend, and in response, Democrats went on a “Negro hunt,” killing every African-American (all of whom were Republicans) in the area they could find. (Via Grand Old Partisan) On April 20, 1871 the Republicans passed the anti-Ku Klux Klan Act outlawing Democratic terrorist groups. The Miller Center reported: Advertisement - story continues below On April 20, 1871, at the urging of President Ulysses Grant, Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act. Also known as the third Enforcement Act, the bill was a controversial expansion of federal authority designed to give the federal government additional power to protect voters. The act established penalties in the form of fines and jail time for attempts to deprive citizens of equal protection under the laws and gave the President the authority to use federal troops and suspend the writ of habeas corpus in ensuring that civil rights were upheld. Founded as a fraternal organization by Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tennessee, in 1866, the Ku Klux Klan soon became a paramilitary group devoted to the overthrow of Republican governments in the South and the reassertion of white supremacy. Through murder, kidnapping, and violent intimidation, Klansmen sought to secure Democratic victories in elections by attacking black voters and, less frequently, white Republican leaders.

The savagery began when racist Democrats attacked a newspaper editor, a white Republican and schoolteacher for ex-slaves. Several African-Americans rushed to the assistance of their friend, and in response, Democrats went on a “Negro hunt,” killing every African-American (all of whom were Republicans) in the area they could find.

Advertisement - story continues below Mayor De Blasio: What’s been hardest is the way our legal system is structured to favor private property. I think people all over this city, of every background, would like to have the city government be able to determine which building goes where, how high it will be, who gets to live in it, what the rent will be. I think there’s a socialistic impulse, which I hear every day, in every kind of community, that they would like things to be planned in accordance to their needs. And I would, too. Unfortunately, what stands in the way of that is hundreds of years of history that have elevated property rights and wealth to the point that that’s the reality that calls the tune on a lot of development. No matter how much pain, suffering, murder and genocide the Communist revolutionaries have spread across the globe, Democrats still think it’s a swell idea. God save this country.

Daily Caller has pointed out the lie by our pathological liar in chief: Despite his claim to having had a cigarette in six years, Obama had one at least as recently as February 2010, according to Dr. Jeffrey Kuhlman, who performed a physical and who was quoted in the New York Times on February 28, 2010.

Michelle Obama initially asked Americans to watch out and to try to catch her husband smoking on the campaign trail in 2008 but she gave him a pass for smoking in March 2010.

This may be the year he’ll struggle,” the First Lady told Politico’s Nia-Malika Henderson in March 2010. When trying to sell Obamacare in 2009, Obama admitted that he occasionally had a smoke.

No,” he said at a press conference in 2009. “I don’t do it in front of my kids,” the president argued. “I don’t do it in front of my family. And, you know, I would say that I am 95 percent cured.

        "articles": "Advertisement By Wayne Allyn Root This is my final column before the midterm election. So, this former Vegas oddsmaker turned national political commentator has a few predictions and common sense observations to make. Back in 2016 I predicted a Trump victory when (** almost) no one else did. Every poll showed Trump would lose by a wide margin. Nate Silver of the NY Times predicted Hillary’s chances of winning at 92%. These pollsters make their living by polling actual human beings. I don’t. So how did I know? Advertisement - story continues below Simple. First, size matters. You could see it in the rallies. Trump would attract eight hour lines and 10,000 or more attendees at wild, intense rallies all over America. I should know. I was opening speaker for six Trump campaign events here in Las Vegas. Meanwhile Hillary was attracting 100 to 200 attendees at a rally here in Vegas. I could fit Hillary’s rallies in my living room. The same story held true across America. That was my first reason for realizing Trump was going to pull a huge upset that few saw coming. TRENDING: Kentucky Health Care Workers Refused to Comply With Vaccine Mandate, Forced Hospital to Fire Them (VIDEOS) Part Duex was also simple. Trump was “the whisper candidate.” Everywhere I went, people whispered in my ear, “I’m with you. I’m for Trump.” They wouldn’t tell pollsters. They wouldn’t put up yard signs. No bumper stickers on their car. No mention of their support of Trump around the office watercooler. But they whispered to me. The pollsters never had a chance. Don’t look now, but it’s all happening again. Nate Silver says Democrats have a 80%+ chance of winning the House. Cook Report says Democrats will win the House by 40 seats. All the experts say it’s over- Democrats will win. I’ll go out on a limb and disagree again. Advertisement - story continues below I see Florida Democrat Governor candidate Andrew Gillum holding a rally with Bernie Sanders and the whole place is empty. Barack Obama could not fill a high school gym in Milwaukee. I witnessed firsthand Joe Biden and Obama at separate events here in Las Vegas playing to small crowds. Meanwhile I was opening speaker for President Trump’s event in Las Vegas last month- with 10,000 waiting in line for hours in a place where no one cares much about politics. This is a phenomenon. Does that sound like the GOP is losing 40 seats? Dream on delusional Democrats. Advertisement - story continues below Then there’s “the whispers.” Nothing has changed. Trump has fulfilled almost all of his campaign promises. He is the only politician in history who did exactly what he promised. And those same voters are whispering to me again- they love Trump now, more than ever. Then there’s common sense. The Trump economy is BOOMING. The latest results are out- 250,000 more jobs last month, far above what was expected. The lowest unemployment in half a century. The number of Americans employed is the highest EVER. Almost 500,000 new manufacturing jobs under Trump. The kind Obama claimed would never happen again. 1000 new manufacturing jobs a day last month- the best results since the 1990’s. And most importantly, wages grew by a remarkable 3.1%- the most in a decade. Who in their right mind would vote against THAT? Advertisement - story continues below That could be why Trump’s approval rating among blacks is now 40%. If only white liberals weren’t blind, deaf and really dumb. Most importantly, Trump has brilliantly kept the emotional issue of illegal immigration front and center. He wants to block the caravan, end birthright citizenship and make it much harder for illegal aliens to claim asylum. The polls are out- 65% of likely voters in swing districts across the USA agree with Trump. The middle class will come out in record numbers for Trump. Bet on it. In the 2014 midterm election in Texas 1.7 million voted early. This year early voting in Texas numbered over 4.3 million. With a booming economy and an illegal alien invasion in the headlines, you think they’re coming out for Democrats? No way Jose. I’ll go out on a limb again. I’ll put my gut instincts up against every poll and pollster and political “expert.” All of them…all of them…say the House is lost. But they don’t have a clue what’s happening. I predict they’re all wrong again. The Silent Majority is whispering again- and they love Trump. They support Trump. They will reward Trump. I’ll go out on a limb again to predict another upset for the GOP on Tuesday. We will expand our Senate majority by 3 to 6 seats. It will be very close but, the GOP will hold the House. America stays bright red- again Democrats will be in shock and mourning. The pollsters got it all wrong again. And Wednesday morning will be the busiest day for psychiatrists and psychologists in the history of America. #REDSTORM Wayne Allyn Root is the host of “The Wayne Allyn Root Show” on Newsmax TV, nightly at 8 PM ET, found on DirecTV Ch #349, or Dish TV Ch #216, at  He is also a nationally syndicated radio host of “WAR Now: The Wayne Allyn Root Show” found at  Advertisement New York Times Obtains Security Footage Revealing \"ISIS Facilitator\" Killed by Biden Drone Strike Was Actually an Aid Worker Returning to His Family (VIDEO) Transgender Fighter Beats the Crap Out of Female Opponent, Wins MMA Debut White Liberal LA Times Columnist Runs to CNN, Smears Larry Elder as a \"White Supremacist\" Two Days Before CA Recall Election (VIDEO) Advertisement Join The Gateway Pundit Newsletter Sign up for our free email newsletter, and we'll make sure to keep you in the loop.

Via Omri Ceron: All of these positions have been clarified as not the administration’s stance, or in the last case simply dropped: TRENDING: Kentucky Health Care Workers Refused to Comply With Vaccine Mandate, Forced Hospital to Fire Them (VIDEOS) (1) Blaming the violence on Israel building settlements — On Tuesday Secretary Kerry seemed to link the wave of violence to Israeli settlement construction: “there’s been a massive increase in settlements over the course of the last years, and now you have this violence because there’s a frustration that is growing” [a]. The premise is strained: recent housing statistics indicate that settlement growth has ebbed to historic lows in the last few years [b]. Even if the premise wasn’t strained, the claim would still be untenable: the narrative driving the terrorism is that Israel is damaging Muslim holy places, specifically the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, and has nothing to do with settlements [c]. White House spokesperson Earnest was asked about Kerry’s assessment at yesterday’s briefing and clarified that “Kerry didn’t assign any specific blame for the recent tensions” [d]. (2) Blaming the violence on Israel violating Muslim holy places – On Wednesday State Department spokesperson Kirby seemed to link the wave of violence to Israel changing the status quo on the Temple Mount: “certainly, the status quo has not been observed, which has led to a lot of the violence” [e]. The claim would be in line with the Palestinian and Israeli-Arab justifications for the recent attacks, under which Israel is accused of either eroding Muslim access to the site or expanding Jewish access. The accusation goes back decades, and is false: the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs recently published a full-blown book exploring its history and debunking its current version [f]. A few hours after the briefing Kirby clarified that the administration assesses Israel has maintained the status quo: “Clarification from today’s briefing: I did not intend to suggest that status quo at Temple Mount/Haram Al-Sharif has been broken” and “We welcome both Israel’s & Jordan’s commitment to continued maintenance of status quo at Temple Mount/Haram Al-Sharif” [g][h]. Advertisement - story continues below (3) Characterizing Israel as using excessive force in combatting the violence – At Wednesday’s briefing Kirby also seemed to characterize the Israelis as using excessive force: “we’ve certainly seen some reports of what many would consider excessive use of force… we’ve certainly seen some reports of security activity that could indicate the potential excessive use of force” [i]. The claim was quickly picked up and echoed by among others Iranian state media [j][k]. It came in for significant criticism on last night’s cable news programs and in Israel [l][m]. Kirby clarified at today’s press briefing: “we have never accused Israeli security forces with excessive force with respect to these terrorist attacks” [n]. (4) Characterizing the Palestinian and Arab-Israeli terrorism as “tragic” and “outrageous” – On Thursday morning the State Department tweeted that Kerry would address “the tragic, outrageous attacks on civilians in Israel and West Bank.” The tweet was quickly deleted [o]. It was replaced by a different tweet that described the attacks as “recent” [p]. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Judge Gonzalo Curiel even awarded scholarships to illegal immigrants in San Diego in 2014.

Then on Tuesday he ordered records to be sealed again – after the liberal media picked over them. The Politico reported: U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel issued an order Friday unsealing various records in the suit, citing significant public interest in the matter, driven in part by Trump’s own public attacks on the judge. TRENDING: Kentucky Health Care Workers Refused to Comply With Vaccine Mandate, Forced Hospital to Fire Them (VIDEOS) However, on Tuesday evening, Curiel tried to roll back his earlier order. He said he had “mistakenly” listed some records to be released in full, when they were actually supposed to be edited or redacted to delete personal information like home addresses and personal emails. Those records are now restricted again on the court’s docketing system, but they are clearly in the possession of numerous news organizations. For instance, a declaration from former Trump University events manager Corinne Summer was posted online by the New York Times, but is no longer available from the court. Advertisement - story continues below “Instructors were trained to, and witnessed them, asking students during the $1,500 seminars to call their credit card companies and raise their credit limits two, three or four times so that they would be able to invest in real estate. They would tell students to max out their credit card because they would make their money back. They couldn’t raise their limit and use it the same day,” Summer wrote. The judge told Trump’s lawyers to file redacted copies of the resealed documents by Thursday so they could again be made public by the court. A judge is so biased against Trump that he released SEALED documents, doxed innocent people.  — Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) June 1, 2016 You must be logged in to post a comment.

Trump won the last 16 Republican contests. Trump has 1,536 delegates and counting. Advertisement - story continues below The Republican Party started the year with 17 bona fide candidates for President. This was more candidates than any major party in history. Trump has more wins than any other Republican or Democrat candidate in this year’s race with 36. He also has more primary wins with 33 and leads all candidates in percent of overall wins and in percent of primary wins. TRENDING: Kentucky Health Care Workers Refused to Comply With Vaccine Mandate, Forced Hospital to Fire Them (VIDEOS) Trump surpassed the number of delegates needed to win the Republican nomination for President a couple weeks ago. This may be more delegates than any other Republican candidate and a higher percentage of delegates than any Republican or Democrat candidate in the race. Advertisement - story continues below Trump received 13,406,108 votes to date in the elections according to www.thegreenpapers.com. As a result Trump has more votes than any candidate in Republican history. Trump shattered the previous record by 1.4 million votes — and that was with 17 candidates in the race George W. Bush had 12 million votes in 2000. The Republican Party also set a party record this year in pre-convention state election turnout with over 28 million votes to date which is 139% of the record high voter turnout in 2008. This increase in votes can be attributed to Donald Trump. Trump won a higher percentage of votes than any candidate ever when considering the number of contenders in the race. He also has the highest percent of delegates when considering the competition than any candidate ever. Advertisement - story continues below Trump may also be the first candidate in the modern era to have funded his campaign by himself during the primary season. Although his results are much more impressive, he only spent a quarter the amount of money as Democrats Clinton and Sanders. He proved to be the real capitalist in the primary while Clinton and Sanders proved to be the socialists freely spending other people’s money. Trump’s accomplishments will now go down in history. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton pulled out the win with more delegates than socialist Sanders. However, nearly a quarter of her delegates came from controversial ‘super delegates’. Her road to the Democratic nomination was far less impressive and may also go down in history because she may be under indictment before the November election.

Gladney, a cancer survivor, was selected by the Carnahan supporters for the beatdown because he was handing out “Don’t Tread On Me” flags and because he was black. The St. Louis Post Dispatch reported at the time: Kenneth Gladney, a 38-year-old conservative activist from St. Louis, said he was attacked by some of those arrested as he handed out yellow flags with “Don’t tread on me” printed on them. He spoke to the Post-Dispatch from the emergency room of the St. John’s Mercy Medical Center, where he said he was waiting to be treated for injuries to his knee, back, elbow, shoulder and face that he suffered in the attack.

And we see it.” “What we will see on Sunday is we will see the start of planning for the next administration. And I can tell you, the people that are at the top of that list, all of them have Trump as their last name.” During his CPAC speech, Trump is expected be offering “a stinging rebuke of the first month of the Biden presidency — while laying out what the GOP needs to do to take Congress in the 2022 midterms.” “He knows it’s a very important reset for him and for the country and for half the country and so many people who are here in this ballroom,” CPAC Chairman Matt Schlapp said on “Fox & Friends” Thursday. Trump is expected to rail against Biden’s rollbacks of policies that were tough on illegal immigration, accuse Biden of pushing identity politics over American identity, the need to reopen schools, and the damage Biden is doing to our workforce. Additionally, he will be pushing the need to break up Big Tech, according to the report. Fox reports that “Trump is expected to go between ‘warming up to the idea of a 2024 run, and walking right up to the line of announcing another campaign’ — though he is not expected to make an actual announcement.” “He will talk about policies that he believes have been successful for the party, while describing a divide in the party between the grassroots and a handful of Beltway insiders. Trump is expected to name names,” the report states. \"We Are Always Looking at More We Can Do\" - Biden Regime Doesn't Rule Out Vaccine Mandates For Domestic Travel (VIDEO) Firefighters and Police Officers Break Into Cheers as Trump Makes Surprise Visit to NYC on 20th Anniversary of 9/11 (VIDEO) Sponsored Support Mike Lindell And Gateway Pundit By Getting Bedsheets (Back In Stock!), Slippers and Patriotic Art At MyPillow.com Join The Gateway Pundit Newsletter Sign up for our free email newsletter, and we'll make sure to keep you in the loop.

TRENDING: Kentucky Health Care Workers Refused to Comply With Vaccine Mandate, Forced Hospital to Fire Them (VIDEOS) The stock market on Wednesday, January 17th, 2018, said it all. On that day the Dow broke 26,000 points for the first time in its history. As a result the Dow broke the record for the fastest 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 and 7,000 point increases between major milestones in the history of the Dow. All of these increases occurred since Donald Trump was elected President. After President Trump was elected the DOW exploded. On November 8th, 2016, the DOW stood at 18,332. Since that date the DOW has soared and it never looked back. Advertisement - story continues below Not only has the DOW skyrocketed since Donald Trump was elected President, the market’s rise is record breaking. Since the 2016 election, the DOW has closed at new record all-time highs 103 times! (President Obama never saw a new all-time high in the DOW his entire first term and only saw 105 all-time closing highs from his first election win until Trump’s.) President Trump’s first year in office (2017) saw the most all-time stock market closing highs (71) as well as the largest increase in DOW history (4,956 points). Prior to 2017, no year in the DOW’s more than 100-year history ever saw the DOW increase by more than 3,500 points, let alone 4,900. The most all-time highs in a year prior to 2017 was 69 in 1995. Since President Trump was elected President the DOW tied the record for the most consecutive all-time closing highs in a row. In January of 1987 President Reagan saw the DOW increase to new all-time highs a record 12 days in a row. In February of 2017, President Trump matched Reagan’s record. The DOW today stands at nearly 32% up from where it was in November of 2016, the day of the election! But today because of the recent downturns in the markets since October 3rd after the Fed announced more interest rates hikes, the MSM is all gloom and doom. Advertisement - story continues below It’s clear that the Fed overstepped its mandate and killed the stock market with their interest rate threats. There are no signs of inflation and commodities are steady and yet the Fed wants to continue to increase rates, something it never did under Obama’s Presidency. The Fed gave Obama zero rates for seven years and then only a quarter rate increase in 2015, his last year. Under President Trump the Fed has increased rates seven times since his election. The markets are taking notice of the Fed’s efforts to kill the economy by increasing interest rates. These efforts and reactions are causing the markets to be out of sync with reality and the solid economy. The truth is the economy is in its best shape maybe ever. The stock markets as of Friday are still up nearly a third (32%) since the election. Advertisement - story continues below President Trump’s economy reached a GDP of 4.2% in the 2nd quarter of 2018 and 3.5% in the 3rd quarter. With a GDP in the 4th quarter near 3%, the GDP for the year will be greater than 3%. Something the prior President Obama never did and said no longer could be done. President Trump has managed to increase GDP and slow of debt increases, thereby decreasing the debt to GDP ratio in the 2 years since the 2016 election. This is a very good result that is rarely if ever mentioned by the MSM. President Trump has done this in spite of headwinds from the Fed. President Trump is the ‘Jobs President’. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 250,000 new jobs were created in October. In President Trump’s first two years since elected President, the US has gained over 4.3 million jobs. (In President Obama’s first two years the US lost over (4.2) million jobs.) More people are working in the US than ever before and unemployment is at 50 year lows landing at 3.7% last month. The President’s tax plan passed in late December 2017 is greatly benefiting Americans and American companies. Employees will see increases in their income tax refunds next year due to the lower Federal taxes.

From The Blaze: Advertisement - story continues below While the bulk of progressive America is still flailing about in disbelief over the election of Donald Trump, a group of progressives is aggressively cobbling together a plan to obstruct the president-elect’s policy goals using the 2009 Tea Party uprising against President Barack Obama as a blueprint. However, there is one principal difference: Unlike the anti-Obama Tea Party, which did not have an identifiable single leader, the progressive movement plans to rally around an open socialist: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I). Of course, progressives have attempted to replicate the political success of the Tea Party before. The abortive and largely ineffectual Occupy Wall Street movement was intended to be a progressive response to the Tea Party effort, but even after being lavished with generous media coverage, Occupy Wall Street petered out without any lasting political impact. TRENDING: Kentucky Health Care Workers Refused to Comply With Vaccine Mandate, Forced Hospital to Fire Them (VIDEOS) Progressives believe they have learned from the failures of Occupy Wall Street and the successes of the Tea Party, and their first goal is to seize firmer control of the Democratic Party apparatus. Up first on their agenda is an aggressive campaign to promote progressive Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to be the new Democratic National Committee chairman. Ellison promises to be a lightning rod for controversy, but his candidacy is enthusiastically supported by Sanders and his influential followers: Gee.

During his speech he told about his first public speech on apartheid at Occidental College. “I am one of the countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela’s life. My very first political action, the first thing I ever did that involved an issue or a policy or politics, was a protest against apartheid. I studied his words and his writings.” Advertisement - story continues below But, Barack Obama forgot to mention that his speech at Occidental was sponsored by Marxists and Weatherman terrorists. Barack Obama’s first public speech was at an Occidental College event sponsored by the Students for Economic Democracy a branch of the Campaign for Economic Democracy [CED]. Far Left radical Tom Hayden who met with Marxist officials several times during his antiwar career chaired this fringe group in the late 70′s and early ’80′s. Several of the CED principal activists were also veterans of the Hayden-campaign and of the very radical group, Students for a Democratic Society. TRENDING: THEY CAUGHT THEM AND THE CROWD CHEERED!!

Tom Hayden wrote this on Barack Obama at the far left Common Dreams website: Advertisement - story continues below I didn’t see him coming. When I heard of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president, I was at least sentient enough to be interested. When I read Dreams of My Father, I was taken aback by its depth. This young man apparently gave his first public speech, against South African apartheid, at an Occidental College rally organized by Students for Economic Democracy, the student branch of the Campaign for Economic Democracy [CED] which I chaired in 1979-82. The buds of curiosity quickened. Soon I was receiving emails from David Peck, an organizer of the Occidental rally, who now is coordinating Americans in Spain for Barack Obama. In 1969 Hayden’s students for democracy group began imploding into factions. One of them, a group calling itself Weatherman, was elected to SDS leadership and proclaimed that the time had come to launch a race war on behalf of the Third World and against the United States. The Weatherman declared “war on AmeriKKKa” at its Flint War Council in 1969. The new entity dissolved Hayden’s Students for a Democratic Society and formed a terrorist cult in its place, which was given the name Weather Underground. How odd that way back in the beginning of Barack Obama’s speaking career the group he was involved with had links to Marxists, the Weatherman and Bill Ayers. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "articles": "Advertisement Guest Post by Mara Zebest Hmmmm…. could Arpaio be on Obama’s enemy list? The tolerant Left sure are determined to destroy Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Advertisement - story continues below Hat tip to ORYR and FoxNews that reports the following: A suspicious package found to contain explosive material and addressed to Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio was intercepted by authorities in Flagstaff Thursday. TRENDING: THEY CAUGHT THEM AND THE CROWD CHEERED!! AZ Audit Team CAUGHT Maricopa County Officials DELETING COMPUTER ELECTION FILES -- VIDEO The box was addressed to Arpaio at his Phoenix headquarters, Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office officials said in a statement obtained by Fox News. Authorities in Flagstaff, a city in Northern Arizona, x-rayed the box and determined it contained an explosive device. A bomb squad was deployed and neutralized it. Advertisement - story continues below Flagstaff Police, the FBI and U.S. Postal inspectors are working the case and authorities there say they already have investigative leads. This comes on the heels of a report from Breitbart on the following: Only three weeks after re-election in 2012, Sheriff Joe Arpaio was hit with a recall effort. Now, with anti-Arpaio petitions in circulation in Maricopa County, Arizona, “America’s Sheriff” is organizing his forces to oppose a recall backed by the deep pockets of the unions, millions of dollars in outside money, and a flood of non-Arizonans arriving to act as the left-wingers’ ground troops. Arpaio’s team is being ramrodded by the Conservative Business League–and unlike the opposition’s recall efforts, the CBL is an Arizona-based organization. The duo taking the helm of the “save Joe” campaign is the CBL’s Ron Ludders and Bob Thomas. Ludders and Thomas say that the left’s effort to destroy Sheriff Joe Arpaio is no less than an effort to use the Colorado model (the campaign that turned Colorado from red to blue) to give Arizona to the Democrats. It is also a mirror of what the left tried to do to Republican Governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin and, if successful, would be a model for Democrats to regain power in Texas. Advertisement - story continues below Strangely, Arizona’s recall law is incredibly loose. An elected official in The Grand Canyon State can be recalled for any reason at all and, with one exception, at any time. Unlike such laws in most states, the Arizona law does not require a recall for cause such as criminal activity, fraud, or other real reasons. The only rule seems to be that the elected official has to be in office for six months into his first term before a recall can be mounted. This rule did not apply to the six-term Sheriff. To start a recall, petitioners must gather the signatures of 25 percent of the number of votes cast in the last election. Involved in the recall effort is one Randy Parraz, a long-time, left-wing Arizona agitator, a failed candidate for office himself, a Huffington Post contributor, a man that has several arrests under his belt and one who was involved in instigating the Seattle World Trade Organization riots back in 1999 when he was a field operative for the AFL-CIO. Today Parraz is the head of Citizens for a Better Arizona. Ludders and Thomas also say he is known as an Obama associate and has visited the President in the White House. […] Read more here.

        "articles": "Advertisement By: Terresa Monroe-Hamilton NoisyRoom.net Evan McGlinn for The New York Times Advertisement - story continues below Lest you mistakenly thought that Amnesty had faded away, no it hasn’t. Marxists and illegal aliens across the US are still pushing it — hard. With the help of Progressives on both sides of the aisle, from Nancy Pelosi on the Left to Paul Ryan on the Right: Thousands of supporters of an immigration overhaul held rallies on Saturday at more than 150 sites in 40 states, trying to pressure Congress, despite the partisan turmoil in Washington, to focus on passing a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants here illegally. TRENDING: THEY CAUGHT THEM AND THE CROWD CHEERED!! AZ Audit Team CAUGHT Maricopa County Officials DELETING COMPUTER ELECTION FILES -- VIDEO Hoping to display the wide reach of their movement, advocates held larger rallies in immigrant strongholds like Los Angeles, San Diego and Boston, with smaller demonstrations in places where immigrant groups have grown recently, including Atlanta; Rogers, Ark.; and Yakima, Wash. Organizers described the events, and a large rally they have planned for Tuesday on the National Mall in Washington, as their major show of force this year. On what they called a “National Day of Immigrant Dignity and Respect,” supporters said more than 50,000 people had turned out nationwide. But the demonstrations came when few lawmakers on Capitol Hill were thinking about immigration, with the federal government shut down and the House of Representatives locked in a feud with President Obama and Democrats over health care and debt funding. Advertisement - story continues below Even while advocates have built up their strength — with a broad coalition of business, labor, religious and law enforcement groups calling for a comprehensive bill — they fear that momentum is slipping away for Congress to act this year. Soon-to-be Communist Mayor of New York, De Blasio led the charge in Brooklyn: In New York, advocates rallied, in an upbeat mood, in Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn and then marched over the Brooklyn Bridge. Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who is the front-runner in the mayoral race, spoke as his wife, Chirlane McCray, stood beside him. He said New York had a “special obligation” to push Congress for a path to citizenship for immigrants without legal status. “We have to set the example here of how to include all of our brothers and sisters even if they’re not documented,” Mr. de Blasio said. Watch both sides of the aisle. While we are embroiled with the thugs and their fascist attack on our WWII Vets at the National Mall, busy little Marxists are giving all they’ve got to move Amnesty forward: Advertisement - story continues below On Wednesday, Democrats in the House of Representatives, at the urging of the minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, introduced a bill that closely matched broad bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate in June, including a path to citizenship for most of an estimated 11.7 million immigrants in the country illegally. The House bill had no Republican sponsors, so its prospects were uncertain at best. But it gave advocates something to rally around, after a bipartisan House group’s efforts to write legislation fell apart last month. Several House Republican leaders, including Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, have said they hoped to hold votes on smaller immigration bills during the fall. Mr. Goodlatte’s committee has approved bills that would sharply tighten immigration enforcement and provide more visas for highly skilled workers, but no bill so far that offers a legal pathway to immigrants here illegally. Advertisement - story continues below You better, you better, you bet… Don’t cross that line Progressives. We’re still watching and fighting and we won’t let you keep Amnesty alive and well and moving forward; entrenching a permanent Marxist majority rule in the US.

        "articles": "Advertisement Remember this? Pelosi told us they had to ram through the Obamacare monstrosity so that you can find out what’s in it. Well, now we know what’s in it… Harry Reid slipped a provision in the Obamacare law that forbids Democrats and the White House from restricting guns and ammo. Forbes reported: As for Reid’s reasons for burying a pro-gun measure into the body of the Affordable Care Act, the Majority Leader is said to have been concerned that the NRA planned to take an active position against the passage of Obamacare and decided, no doubt with the permission of Reid’s friend, NRA boss Wayne LaPierre, to head the problem off at the pass by putting language in the bill that would mollify the gun lobby. Advertisement - story continues below Further, there was concern that a conspiracy theory then in circulation among right-wing circles—a meme suggesting that the Obama Administration had cleverly planted language in the ACA that could be used as a tool to get to the guns—would further erode public support for the legislation. For these reasons, Reid determined to insert some cozy language for the gun people into the Senate version of the ACA—language certain to escape public review at a time when the conversation was far more focused on hot button subjects like death panels, taxes and mandates. For these reasons, the following language did, indeed, become a part of the nation’s controversial health care reform law: TRENDING: THEY CAUGHT THEM AND THE CROWD CHEERED!! AZ Audit Team CAUGHT Maricopa County Officials DELETING COMPUTER ELECTION FILES -- VIDEO (c) PROTECTION OF SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS.— ‘‘(1) WELLNESS AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS.— A wellness and health promotion activity implemented under subsection (a)(1)(D) may not require the disclosure or collection of any information relating to— ‘‘(A) the presence or storage of a lawfully- possessed firearm or ammunition in the residence or on the property of an individual; or ‘‘(B) the lawful use, possession, or storage of a firearm or ammunition by an individual. ‘‘ (2) LIMITATION ON DATA COLLECTION.—None of the authorities provided to the Secretary under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or an amendment made by that Act shall be construed to authorize or may be used for the collection of any in- formation relating to— ‘‘(A) the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition; ‘‘(B) the lawful use of a firearm or ammunition; or ‘‘(C) the lawful storage of a firearm or ammunition. ‘‘(3) LIMITATION ON DATABASES OR DATA BANKS.—None of the authorities provided to the Secretary under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or an amendment made by that Act shall be construed to authorize or may be used to maintain records of individual ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition. So, the question is… What isn’t in the Obamacare law? This may be a win for gun owners but it also shows the depth of corruption in the Democratic Party. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "articles": "Advertisement Jill Stein is asking for recounts in an effort to nullify the electoral votes of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Federal law says that presidential recounts must be completed within 35 days after an election. Stein waited until 90 minutes before the Wisconsin deadline for filing a recount petition expired. All the votes have to be certified by December 13 according to a report on Friday. The electors meet on December 19. Advertisement - story continues below Wisconsin will almost certainly miss that deadline, since the last recount took more than a month. And that recount was for a state Supreme Court contest where only 1.5 million votes were cast. If Wisconsin misses the December 19 deadline, the electoral votes may not be counted. TRENDING: Kentucky Health Care Workers Refused to Comply With Vaccine Mandate, Forced Hospital to Fire Them (VIDEOS) Stein is going to ask for a hand recount, which will slow the process even further. If Wisconsin’s electoral votes are excluded on December 19, the state will then have to try and get Congress to include the votes in the January 6 count. Advertisement - story continues below According to Inquisitr: The statewide recount in the presidential election would require a recount of nearly twice as many ballots — about 3 million — and the process would become even more cumbersome if Stein is successful in requiring a recount by hand, as she has said she prefers. If the proposed Wisconsin recount is not completed on time, the state’s 10 Electoral College votes could be rendered void. In that scenario, Trump would be left with 296 electoral votes, which is still 26 more than the 270 needed to win the presidency. But two other states, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Stein plans to demand a recount could cause even more severe turmoil. So the situation is actually much worse than most people think. Advertisement - story continues below Stein may successfully strip Trump of the electoral votes of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. If so, it’ll be up to Congress to decide whether they include the votes or not. You’re letting them distract you. IT ISN’T THE VOTES. The goal is to the nullify the electoral votes by making the states miss the deadline.  — Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 27, 2016 Hat Tip Thomas You must be logged in to post a comment.
